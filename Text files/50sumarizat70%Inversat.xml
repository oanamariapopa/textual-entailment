    <t>There is so much on this issue I donapos;t know what to explain first.  Fact 1: There has been no significant atmospheric warming since 1998. In addition to this, there has been a lack of an atmospheric hotspot (in the mid to upper troposphere) that was predicted to be caused by greenhouse gas caused warming. This in itself proves that greenhouse gasses are not causing the recent warming trend. No warming 1: http://blogs.news.com.au... No warming 2: http://4.bp.blogspot.com... Lack of hotspot 1: https://mises.org... Lack of hotspot 2: http://sciencespeak.com... (Specifically on pg 6 but I suggest you read more)  Fact 2: Co2 is an extraordinarily weak greenhouse gas. According to atomic absorption spectroscopy, it can only store and release 7% of the electromagnetic spectrum that passes through it.  Fact 3: Throughout Earths history, Co2 has been much higher in the past showing that recent levels of Co2 are harmless. http://www.paulmacrae.com...  Fact 4: Recently, ice core data shows that Co2 followed temperature, sometimes by hundreds of years, not the other way around. Lags warming 1: https://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com... Lags warming 2: http://joannenova.com.au... Lags warming 3: http://i29.tinypic.com...  Fact 5: Co2 has never caused amplification of warming in the past. It is simple logic. If Co2 amplified temperature after orbital changes raised the temperature first, when would the amplification stop? The answer is when there is no more Co2 in the oceans. This would cause the oceans to become abnormally basic and this has only happened once in the last 25 million years: Ocean pH 25 million years: https://www.manicore.com... (I know it shows acidification at the end but this does not contradict my argument because it is a different result of more Co2.)  Fact 6: Almost every single computer model made by the IPCC is wrong. This suggests something fundamentally wrong with the models used. In addition, the models are all wrong because they predict to much heat which suggests that the effect of Co2 is being overblown. Computer models wrong 1: https://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com... Computer models wrong 2: http://c3headlines.typepad.com... Computer models wrong 3: http://cdn.phys.org...  Fact 7: The Earth has been warming for 15000 (or 20000) years. Warming for 15000 (or 20000 it depends on the data) years: http://www.oarval.org...  Fact 8: In the last 8000 years, we have had 4 major global warm periods naturally. We had the medieval warm period, the roman warm period, the Minoan warm period and the Holocene maximum. All major warm periods: http://notrickszone.com... Medieval warm period was global 1: http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org... Medieval warm period was global 2: http://www.climatedepot.com...  Fact 9: All major planet bodies in our solar system are experiencing rapid climate change, indicating that the heating on Earth could be caused by something in the solar system, not the planet.  Mars: Ice caps are shrinking, two pictures showed possible warming (these could be unreliable due to dust storms), atmosphere is gaining clouds, ozone and water vapor (indicating warming).  Pluto: Mysterious dark spots are becoming larger, atmospheric pressure increased by 300% (indicating warming)  Saturn: Giving off x-rays, growing storm spots and other hot spots in its atmosphere (indicating warming)  Uranus: Polar shifts, 2 large storms spots that were not there 50 years ago (indicating warming)  Mercury: Gaining a magnetic field, polar ice caps growing (indicating cooling)  Jupiter: Plasma clouds merging together and growing new storm spots (indicating an 18 degree Celsius warming)  Venus: 2500% increase in green glow indicating more oxygen in its atmosphere  Neptune: Weird changes in light intensity.  Earth: Rapid warming  As you can see, every major planet in our solar system is experiencing rapid climate change. Scientists theorize that this is due to increased amounts of energy in the space around our solar system.  Fact 10: There is no scientific way to test whether Co2 causes global warming. Yes, Co2 is a greenhouse gas and traps warmth, I am not denying that. What we havenquot;t tested is whether this warmth has a great enough impact to trump all other factors that influence climate. For example, ocean currents, cosmic rays, sun irradiance, the sun spot cycle, Earthquot;s magnetic field, Earthquot;s orbit, Earthquot;s tilt, Volcanos, etcquot; all effect the climate. Why is Co2 more important than all of these factors? Letquot;s find out! Oh, wait, you canquot;t. This is where you reach a problem. How do you find out? You canquot;t, scientifically, create a real, controlled experiment to test whether Co2 has a bigger impact than any of these other factors. This means that the entire idea that Co2 causes climate change is based on computer models and it canquot;t actually be tested. This shows that the idea that Co2 causes warming is less science then it is religion because you are putting your faith in a computer model rather than observing and recording data. Keep in mind that simple correlations do not qualify as scientific data.  Fact 11: During the post economic boom, when Co2 soared, temperatures fell despite the increase in Co2. This has been blamed on increased sulfur emissions but NASA says, quot;the cooling effect of the pollution aerosols will be somewhat regionally dependent, near and downwind of industrial areasquot; which explains how sulfur would only cause cooling in or around the areas it was released. This means that sulfur could not be responsible for the cooling. Post war economic boom: http://www.ofcomswindlecomplaint.net... Co2 levels: https://www3.epa.gov... As you can see, Co2 levels rose dramatically during the post economic boom, past what they had ever been at before, yet temperatures fell.  In conclusion, I have provided 11 facts explaining how Co2 can not, or has never been, a main climate driver. All the historical and recent evidence is stacked against it. While my opponent gives links to a consensus and impacts of possible warming, I have focused on the argument at hand. Explaining why Co2 does not drive climate. While my opponent has made little to no argument, I have shown why the conclusions of the scientists in the consensus he listed were wrong. I thank my opponent for this debate, and may the best man/woman win!</t>

    <t>First my opponent says that I should have asked questions about the structure earlier in the debate but ignores the fact that, in the comment section, I did ask about the order of the debate and explain what I thought it meant. Therefore, I did alert my opponent to my confusion and my opponent either chose to ignore it or did not see it but either way I made my confusion known. Therefore, my opponent did break their own rules.  My opponent then says, quot;if you are so sure you are correct and there are so many climate change deniers, why donapos;t you publish your r2-3 arguments in a peer reviewed journal?quot; My response to this is that: 1. There are not many climate change skeptics. This is because people choose not to be skeptical because believing in man made global warming is how you get grants. 2. I donapos;t publish my findings in a peer reviewed journal because they would not get published. This is because the people who choose what to publish in the journals most likely believe in man made global warming and are therefore biased against me. Another reason a journal would not publish a skeptical article about man made global warming is that if they did, then they would be accused of being funded by fossil fuel companies and would be ridiculed. Other scientists have already tried to publish their findings and it is always rejected so why should I try? What people donapos;t realize is that by attacking anyone who has a skeptical view of man made climate change you are preventing research into that area and therefore creating a huge bias in the experiments done and articles published.  In conclusion, my opponent has not rebutted even one of my claims, instead they focus on the accusations of rule breaking. Due to this absence of rebuttals, my arguments stand and therefore, based on this debate, I have proven how climate change is not much of a threat, and that global warming is not caused by man. While my opponent may of used abstracts from peer reviewed articles (as they love pointing out) I have won the debate. I have given 11 points to why climate change is not due to Co2 and given countless examples of natural disaster frequency staying constant. All of the arguments I have made in this debate go uncontested and therefore prove that climate change is not man made and that the threat is exaggerated.

    <t>Hello, loyal comrades.  As a devout socialist (coughs and splutters- apparently the word communist is illegal nowadays) I can confirm that the idea of an environment is a plot to destroy the capitalist infidels of the west, the idea is to push their focus so far into ideas of global warming and the environment that they will not see the coming revolution. Before they know it, the means of production will have been seized and the bourgeoise crippled.  The master plan for the environmental decoy was first formed by loyal soviet Leonid Kzyladskystok, whoapos;s idea was taken by Comrade Stalin, and itapos;s creator purged.

<h>    Hello, loyal comrades.  As a devout socialist (coughs and splutters- apparently the word communist is illegal nowadays) I can confirm that the idea of an environment is a plot to destroy the capitalist infidels of the west, the idea is to push their focus so far into ideas of global warming and the environment that they will not see the coming revolution. Before they know it, the means of production will have been seized and the bourgeoise crippled.  The master plan for the environmental decoy was first formed by loyal soviet Leonid Kzyladskystok, whoapos;s idea was taken by Comrade Stalin, and itapos;s creator purged. The mighty Stalin then locked the idea away in a secret KGB chamber for later use. It was discovered years later, after the apos;fallapos; of the mighty Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, by loyal communist Hai Chi Zendog, who took the proposition to Xingping of China, who put the idea into action.

    <t>I would say the idea of the environment started with Charles Darwin in 1859. quot;The theory of evolution by natural selection, first formulated in Darwinapos;s book quot;On the Origin of Speciesquot; in 1859, is the process by which organisms change over time as a result of changes in heritable physical or behavioral traits.

    <t>OutlineI. IntroII. CorrelationIII. Confounding factorsIV. Reverse causalityV. Likely a threatVI. Man made VII. ConclusionVIII. SourcesI. Intro Brief intro, I created this debate before, and expected an easy win. I was completely blind sided by my opponentapos;s arguments and it was too late in the debate to recover. Basically, I ended up with a tangled mess and decided the best move was to give up and make a fresh start. Feel free to make the same arguments if you debated me before. Burden of proof, I need to prove three objectives to win. Burden of proof should be 99% Pro and 1% con on all three objectivesII. CorrelationTo prove causation I first need to prove correlation, which is easy enough. Insert picture here. [0] It is well known that carbon is increasing in parts per million. Now at 404.48 ppm[1]http://static.skepticalscience.com...; /gt;III. Confounding factorsThe second problem is confounding factors. Mostly some solar event that affects the entire solar system. Since only a few planets and moons are warming it is safe to assume there are no confounding factors with enough impact to be relevant. [2][3]To restate, surely there are negligible confounding factors that are irrelevant.IV. Reverse causalityNow the only part that is left for the first part of the burden of proof is causality. Co2 and global temperature have a two way causality relationship. Meaning as the oceans heat, Co2 is released which in turns heats up the ocean more. For example, when exiting an ice age first the Earth tilts raising temperature. [4]The temperature increase causes the oceans to release Co2 which is a green house gas. The green house gas in turn increase the oceanapos;s temperatures. Therefore, it is safe to say that Co2 causes global climate change. Readers should now be at least 99% sure that Co2 causes global climate change and warming.V. Likely a threatNow, to prove that the climate change we are experiencing regardless of the cause is a threat, we need a correlation when temperatures suddenly changed. Using the Antarctica ice, we can look at Co2 and temperatures back millions of years. Whenever we see a sudden spike in temperature mass extinctions occur.Mass extinction are a threat to the human race. In fact mass extinctions are occurring right now. Therefore, I have proven then sudden temperature changes, including the one we are experiencing at this moment are correlated with mass extinctions which we are experiencing now. There is also many political problems and threats that come with global climate change. [5] Bill Nye thinks IS (Islamic State) is linked with climate change. Farmers are abandoing their lands due to water shortfalls and becoming terrorists. Therefore, the Paris attacks were caused in part by global climate change.[6] I have fufilled my burden of proof that there is a 99% chance that climate change is a threat.VI. Man madeNow the most difficult part, to prove the changes are man-made. Many climate change deniers will agree with the first two parts and strongly disagree with the third. I need to prove there is at least a 99% chance that man made climate change is real. First, man made Co2 is only a small portion of the Co2 generated. The problem is two fold, first humans are destroying Co2 sinks including forests. Via human made deforestation we are removing much of our Co2 buffer. Second, we are producing Co2 via burning of fossil fuels. Unlike naturally occurring Co2 this is not cycled. Another way of explaining is that non-human Co2 is balanced out by naturally occurring events. Despite being small, made-made Co2 is upsetting the balance of nature. Yet, the question remains, how do we know its not natural? Remember the oceans releasing Co2. Well if this was a natural event the increase in Co2 would come from the oceans. To disprove this is not a natural event we can simply look at the Co2 and acidity of the oceans. The oceans are gaining in Co2 not losing. Meaning this is not a natural event that raises temperature and the Co2 is released from the oceans. Instead, the oceans are absorbing more Co2 then losing. [7] I have met my burden of proof that there is at least a 99% chance that global climate change is man made. VII. ConclusionJust in case you needed more evidence here is some easily observable evidence including glaciers. [8] I have fulfilled my burden of proof, 99% that climate change is real and a threat. Man made global climate change is real and is a threat. Thanks for the debate. VIII.

    <t>My opponent accepts that his first argument is a correlation so there is no need to strengthen my argument there.  My opponents second argument states, quot;quot;quot;When the Earth comes out of an ice age, the warming is not initiated by CO2 but by changes in the Earthapos;s orbit. The warming causes the oceans to release CO2. The CO2 amplifies the warming and mixes through the atmosphere, spreading warming throughout the planet. So CO2 causes warming AND rising temperature causes CO2 rise. Overall, about 90% of the global warming occurs after the CO2 increase.quot;quot;quot;  To disprove this I will do it line by line.  Line 1: When the Earth comes out of an ice age, the warming is not initiated by CO2 but by changes in the Earthapos;s orbit This line is true but only in some cases. For example, the mini ice age, which we exited 1000 years ago, was not initiated by changes in the earths orbit.  Line 2: This line is just wrong. The oceans do store Co2 but what is released when they warm is mostly water vapor, not Co2. This water vapor then causes more clouds which then cools the Earth. This is common knowledge among scientists because this is exactly how cosmic rays cause cooling.  Line 3: Yes, rising temperature causes more Co2 to be released but by simply looking at ice core data we can see that this does not cause an infinite rise in temperature. The temperature then drops and rises again independent of the Co2 that was released from the previous rise. For an example, look at this graph: http://www.geocraft.com...  My opponents next argument is just plain wrong. My opponent states, quot;quot;Even if we ignore long term trends and just look at the record-breakers, 2015, 2014, 2010, and 2005 were hotter than 1998.  The myth of no warming since 1998 was based on the satellite record estimates of the temperature of the atmosphere. However, as discussed in the video below by Peter Sinclair, even that argument is no longer accurate. The satellites show warming since 1998 too.quot; quot;  To disprove this all you need to do is read the caption at the top of the graph below where it lists its source. http://4.bp.blogspot.com... As you can see, the graph was not based on temperature estimates but the quot;global mean temperature change...quot; I donapos;t know where you got the idea that 2015, 2014, 2010, and 2005 were hotter than 1998 but from your sources it seems that this data is only true once you remove the El Nino. My question to you is why hasnapos;t the Earth warmed since the El Nino. In the 20 years since the temperature maximum temperature doesnapos;t increase at all. In addition to this, the El Nino just proves the fact that there are other influences in climate that influence temperature more then Co2 or enough to distort data.  For my opponents next argument he states that my source is not credible. This is just not true. Just because the maker of the website is paid to research evidence against man made global warming does not immediately make all of his evidence untrue. My opponent does not provide any actual contrary evidence to debate this point but to satisfy their needs I will give a link to multiple graphs sourced from other websites showing the same thing. http://c3headlines.typepad.com... http://www.drroyspencer.com... http://i.dailymail.co.uk... http://www.cafeconlecherepublicans.com...  My opponents next argument is not relevant to man made climate change.  My opponents next argument states, quot;Not every prediction in the Inconvenient Truth came true. Nevertheless polar bears are struggling and many ice caps are melting. [5]  As for the polar bears this is due to hunting restrictions and bans. quot;  I will cede this point to my opponent as it is a result of warming and not relevant to man causing the warming. I should not have brought it up and while I still have arguments to dispute it do not wish to argue this view any longer.  As for why the documentary was manipulated, I do not wish to argue this any more either for the same reasons listed above nevertheless I will provide a short article to explain my first argument. I know that the article does not provide much info on the subject but if you really want to understand the argument then you need to research it yourself. http://www.newsmax.com...  Nextl, to strengthen my point of the debate, I will argue that Earth is not the only planet warming. The entire solar system seems to be going through a sort of quot;climate-change phase.quot; Within the last 20 years scientists at NASA and around the world have realized that the planets we are looking at now are different than those in 1900s. This indicates that the entire solar system is in some sort of solar-system wide climate change.  For example, the ice caps on Mars are shrinking (indicating warming) and the atmosphere is gaining clouds and ozone, Pluto is experiencing a growth of its mysterious dark spots and is experiencing a 300% increase in atmospheric pressure (indicating warming), Saturn is giving off large amount of x rays and there are new appearances of quot;hot spotsquot; in its atmosphere (indicating warming), there have been polar shifts on Uranus and voyager 2 picked up large storm spots In its atmosphere that were not there 50 years ago (indicating warming), Mercury is growing a magnetic field, Jupiterquot;s quot;white ovalsquot; are disappearing and melding together in its atmosphere (this is theorized to have been caused by an 18 degree Celsius warming and this is supported by the new large storm spots appearing on Jupiter for the first time), Venus has had a 2500% increase in green glow which symbolizes oxygen in the atmosphere, and Neptune is experiencing changes in light intensity.  As you can see from the long paragraph I have provided above, the entire Solar System seems to be warming or experiencing some sort of weird climate change patterns. This indicates more then just a global event.  To conclude my argument, I will provide a graph of Co2 and Temperature over the long term that should, on its own, disprove entirely the idea of man-made climate change. http://www.paulmacrae.com...</t>

As for why the documentary was manipulated, I do not wish to argue this any more either for the same reasons listed above nevertheless I will provide a short article to explain my first argument. http://www.newsmax.com. The entire solar system seems to be going through a sort of quot;climate-change phase.quot; Within the last 20 years scientists at NASA and around the world have realized that the planets we are looking at now are different than those in 1900s. This indicates that the entire solar system is in some sort of solar-system wide climate change.  For example, the ice caps on Mars are shrinking (indicating warming) and the atmosphere is gaining clouds and ozone, Pluto is experiencing a growth of its mysterious dark spots and is experiencing a 300% increase in atmospheric pressure (indicating warming), Saturn is giving off large amount of x rays and there are new appearances of quot;hot spotsquot; in its atmosphere (indicating warming), there have been polar shifts on Uranus and voyager 2 picked up large storm spots In its atmosphere that were not there 50 years ago (indicating warming), Mercury is growing a magnetic field, Jupiterquot;s quot;white ovalsquot; are disappearing and melding together in its atmosphere (this is theorized to have been caused by an 18 degree Celsius warming and this is supported by the new large storm spots appearing on Jupiter for the first time), Venus has had a 2500% increase in green glow which symbolizes oxygen in the atmosphere, and Neptune is experiencing changes in light intensity.</h>

    <t>First, I would like to thank my opponent for debating this topic with me in a respectful manner. Courage is needed to go against the majority.

The warming causes the oceans to release CO2. The CO2 amplifies the warming and mixes through the atmosphere, spreading warming throughout the planet. So CO2 causes warming AND rising temperature causes CO2 rise. Overall, about 90% of the global warming occurs after the CO2 increase.quot;quot; [2]There should be no doubt that CO2 causes global warming. quot;Especially when 25% of all Co2 produced by man has been released in the last 20 years and in that time there has been NO NET WARMING!!!quot; rammer5678All caps always helps prove science.

    <t>My opponent does not counter-argue even one of the points I made in my previous arguments/in the comment section. Instead he accuses of of making the argument grow in size to confuse people. Not only is this not true, but it points out how little my opponent understands my argument and this subject. If he had simply read the counter arguments I provided, you can see clearly that I do not try to distract from the topic at hand.  Seeing as my opponent made no further arguments and did not make any comments about how I disproved all of his (relating to man causing the warming) claims, I am only left with the option to strengthen my own argument.  Fact 1: Co2 is a weak greenhouse gas. According to atomic absorption spectroscopy, a method in science used to measure the amount of the electromagnetic spectrum a molecule can store/release, Co2 can only store 7% of the heat that passes through it in the 15 micrometer range. This is minuscule, especially when compared to water vapor which can store 850% more heat then Co2 can.  Fact 2: There is not much Co2 in the atmosphere compared to the rest of the earths history and history tells us there is little to no correlation of temperature to Co2 over long periods of time. It is as simple as looking at this graph: http://www.paulmacrae.com...  Fact 3: Almost every single planet in the solar system is exhibiting some sort of characteristic attributed to warming. If every planet is warming simultaneously, then why is Earth warming not natural. (For more info check the comment section where there was a mini debate on the subject or my previous debate where I explained the attributes each planet it expressing)  Fact 3: There has been no significant warming in the last 20 years. We have already discussed this topic and my opponent brought up a good argument against it but I disproved it in my last argument (and the comment section). (Keep in mind that in the last 20 years 25% of all Co2 released by man has been released during that period)  Fact 4: The Earth has been warming for the last 20,000 years and the recent uptick started in the 1700apos;s, before the industrial revolution. https://conscioustourism.files.wordpress.com...  Fact 5: Sun spots and ocean currents correlated stronger with temperature then Co2 for the majority of the 1900s. Yes, sun spot numbers decreased towards the end of the 1900s but that is also right before temperatures flat lined. Sun Spots Graph: (According to Joe Bastardi the correlation (not on this exact graph) )is .57 1900-2004) http://www.soest.hawaii.edu... Ocean Current Graph: (According to Joe Bastardi the correlation here is .85 1900s-2007) http://i0.wp.com... Co2 Graph: (According to Joe Bastardi the correlation (not on this exact graph) is .47 1895-2007) http://zfacts.com...  Fact 6: Cosmic rays prove that greenhouse gasses do not have a big impact on the atmosphere. Cosmic rays effect temperature by increasing evaporation, and, in turn, causing more cloud cover which reflects the suns heat off the earth. This disproves man-made climate change because the water vapor doesnquot;t cause the earth to warm more than the clouds it forms causes the Earth to cool. This just proves the fact that other variables in the climate have way more of an effect on the overall temperature then most greenhouse gasses and the idea that Co2, which is weaker then water vapor, solely dictates climate is just plain wrong.  Fact 7: Almost every single climate model prediction warming from Co2 was wrong (see earlier argument for graphs)  Fact 8: There is no way to scientifically test, through a controlled experiment, whether Co2 causes enough warming to drive the atmosphere. You can test that the Co2 is a greenhouse gas, but you canapos;t test that it is a strong enough greenhouse gas to impact global climate. This just proves that the idea that Co2 causes warming is not based in science. It is based off of faith in computer models or flawed logic.  In conclusion, I have now proven, beyond any doubt, that Co2 cannot be the main climate driver. I have given historical evidence, explained the flaws in the logic presented through cosmic ray induced cooling, shown how Co2 driving climate canapos;t be scientifically tested, explained how we are not the only planet experiencing warming and described how much stronger other climate drivers are then Co2 by presenting correlation strengths of each driver. My opponent has effectively given up the argument and accused me of distracting the readers from the problem at hand. As you can see, just by reading the 8 facts listed above, I have not distracted, I have not manipulated. I have provided clear, easy to understand, proof to why my opponent is wrong. I have disproven all of his arguments, whether in the comment section or in my arguments presented above and given countless examples of evidence to why my side of the argument is correct. Thank you for reading this long debate and I hope you are certain of the right choice when you vote.  To my opponent: I will be very surprised if you are reading this because it seems you have been ignoring my arguments from the beginning. You are so biased towards your own opinion that I am surprised you even decided to read any of my arguments instead of saying, quot;oh, he didnapos;t separate the lines into enough paragraphs!quot; and ignoring them. I have looked at your past debates and concluded that, while you have done a good job at defeating some people, Retroz and maybe Epidexipteryx have both gotten the better of you. Even in your past debates (including the ones you have won) you have not been able to prove anything you claim. You attack sources, you focus on grammar, but you donapos;t focus on your argument. This is why you attacked the whatsupwiththat website without providing any actual evidence showing the data I presented from it was wrong. In fact, you even admitted it was right! This just proves that attacking sources doesnapos;t get you anywhere with your argument. Just a side tip, if you are going to attack anyone elseapos;s sources in future arguments, skeptical science isnapos;t a trustworthy website either.

Here is an article saying the same thing: http://www.forbes.com... Keep in mind that this renders almost every single one of your arguments useless so if this debate actually focused on how credible sources are, I would instantly win.  I thank you for participating in this debate, it was very fun, and I hope that we can both part from this as friends (or people that know each other online and happened to do a debate together whichever you prefer)</t>

    <t>I am here to debate the MAN MADE side of climate change. I do not disagree that the world is warming, I only believe the current warming trends are exaggerated and people are freaking out over a natural process.  Man Made Climate Change, The FACTS:  1.There is NO way to test whether Co2 is the most contributing factor to the worldquot;s climate: Many people I have met say, quot;Manmade global warming is real and Co2 is the cause!quot; but how do you actually test that. Yes, Co2 is a greenhouse gas and traps warmth, I am not denying that. What we havenquot;t tested is whether this warmth has a great enough impact to trump all other factors that influence climate. For example, ocean currents, cosmic rays, sun irradiance, the sun spot cycle, Earthquot;s magnetic field, Earthquot;s orbit, Earthquot;s tilt, Volcanos, etcquot; all effect the climate. Why is Co2 more important than all of these factors? Letquot;s find out! Oh, wait, you canquot;t. This is where you reach a problem. How do you find out? You canquot;t, scientifically, create a real, controlled experiment to test whether Co2 has a bigger impact than any of these other factors. This means that the entire idea that Co2 causes climate change is based on computer models and it canquot;t actually be tested. This shows that the idea that Co2 causes warming is less science then it is religion because you are putting your faith in a computer model rather than observing and recording data. Keep in mind that simple correlations do not qualify as scientific data. Proof that greenhouse gasses donquot;t have a large impact on climate can be found at the bottom of this page at quot;Final Proof.quot; 2.The computer models donquot;t work The computer models mentioned previously have been shown not to work time and time again. Even the most advanced ones fail and donquot;t predict the correct temperature. This is because people think that Co2 has more of an impact then it really does so when they program it into the models it messes with the correct predictions. This is why the vast majority of climate models predict temperature is way higher than it is. https://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com...  3.Co2 is a weak greenhouse gas According to atomic absorption spectroscopy, a method used to measure the amount of the electromagnetic spectrum a molecule can absorb, Co2 can only store a miniscule 7% of the amount of heat that passes through it in the 15 micrometer range. Compare this to water vapor, which, in statistics, can store 850% more heat than Co2 can. In addition to this, there is 2100000% more water vapor in the air then Co2. This shows that Co2 is actually a relatively weak greenhouse gas and for it to make an impact you would need much more of it then there is now.  4.There is not as much Co2 as you might think I have constantly heard, over and over again, that there is too much Co2 in the atmosphere. The problem with this statement is that it is just plain wrong. Comparing the amount of Co2 we have in the atmosphere now (400 parts per million, ppm for short) and we have had in the last 650 million years shows that now we are in a Co2 starved era. For example, look at this graph: http://www.paulmacrae.com... Keep in mind that this graph only goes back 650 million years. Co2 has been over 10000ppm in the past and temperature had been relatively low at that time.  5.The earth has been warming for 20,000 years now: Not only is the idea that Co2 is causing the recent warming preposterous, but it just doesnquot;t make any sense. This is because the world has been warming naturally for the last 20,000 years and the recent uptick in warming started in the 1700s. Both of these time periods were before any humans were releasing any significant amount of Co2. This only proves that the current warm phase is natural. https://conscioustourism.files.wordpress.com... More evidence would be that there hasnquot;t been any significant warming in the last 20 years. Yes, this is a small amount of time, but if temperature truly relied on Co2 as its main cause then surely the temperature should have gone up. Especially considering that 25% of all Co2 released by man ever has been released into the atmosphere in the last few decades.  The political side of things: This is a big topic so I wonquot;t be able to cover everything but I will do the most important topics under this subject. The 97% number: This number is thrown around way too often and most of the time misused. This number came from a study that stated as its conclusion, quot;97% of climate scientists agree that climate change is realquot; but everyone seems to think it said man-made climate change was real. Another problem with this number is that it came from a survey that completely manipulated almost every scientific paper that was submitted. All the papers in the survey were ultimately sent to one man (John Cook) who categorized based on what he thought they meant. Not only is this a biased way of filtering through papers but what the papers said depended on his opinion, not on their actual statements. This anti-science method of categorizing papers eventually led thousands of scientific papers to be misrepresented in the survey. Watch this video to hear what I said but in a more in-depth way: https://www.youtube.com...  The 2 degree rise: This claim is also completely bogus. The idea that a 2 degree rise in average temperature is going to devastate the world is just plain wrong. The world was 2 degrees warmer during the medieval warming period 1000 years. Then, before the medieval warming period was the Roman warming period which was warmer then the medieval. Then, even before the Roman, there was the Minoan warming period which was 4 degrees Celsius warmer then today.  The hockey stick: The graph was fabricated and is completely fake and manipulated. Iquot;m too lazy to explain it all so click on the presentation someone else made below to find out why Iquot;m right: http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org...  The final proof: And now, I present to you, the final proof of why man-made climate change isnquot;t real: It is known that cosmic rays effect temperature by increasing evaporation, and, in turn, causing more cloud cover which reflects the suns heat off the earth. This disproves man-made climate change because the water vapor, which is 850% more potent then Co2, doesnquot;t cause the earth to warm more than the clouds it forms causes the Earth to cool. This just proves the fact that other factors in the climate have way more of an effect on the overall temperature then most greenhouse gasses and the idea that Co2, which is weaker then water vapor, solely dictates climate is just plain wrong.</t>
<h>    I am here to debate the MAN MADE side of climate change. I do not disagree that the world is warming, I only believe the current warming trends are exaggerated and people are freaking out over a natural process.  Man Made Climate Change, The FACTS:  1.There is NO way to test whether Co2 is the most contributing factor to the worldquot;s climate: Many people I have met say, quot;Manmade global warming is real and Co2 is the cause!quot; but how do you actually test that. Yes, Co2 is a greenhouse gas and traps warmth, I am not denying that. What we havenquot;t tested is whether this warmth has a great enough impact to trump all other factors that influence climate. For example, ocean currents, cosmic rays, sun irradiance, the sun spot cycle, Earthquot;s magnetic field, Earthquot;s orbit, Earthquot;s tilt, Volcanos, etcquot; all effect the climate. Why is Co2 more important than all of these factors. Letquot;s find out. Oh, wait, you canquot;t. This is where you reach a problem. You canquot;t, scientifically, create a real, controlled experiment to test whether Co2 has a bigger impact than any of these other factors. This means that the entire idea that Co2 causes climate change is based on computer models and it canquot;t actually be tested. This shows that the idea that Co2 causes warming is less science then it is religion because you are putting your faith in a computer model rather than observing and recording data. Keep in mind that simple correlations do not qualify as scientific data. Proof that greenhouse gasses donquot;t have a large impact on climate can be found at the bottom of this page at quot;Final Proof.quot; 2.The computer models donquot;t work The computer models mentioned previously have been shown not to work time and time again. Even the most advanced ones fail and donquot;t predict the correct temperature. This is because people think that Co2 has more of an impact then it really does so when they program it into the models it messes with the correct predictions. https://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com.  3.Co2 is a weak greenhouse gas According to atomic absorption spectroscopy, a method used to measure the amount of the electromagnetic spectrum a molecule can absorb, Co2 can only store a miniscule 7% of the amount of heat that passes through it in the 15 micrometer range. Compare this to water vapor, which, in statistics, can store 850% more heat than Co2 can. In addition to this, there is 2100000% more water vapor in the air then Co2. This shows that Co2 is actually a relatively weak greenhouse gas and for it to make an impact you would need much more of it then there is now.  4.There is not as much Co2 as you might think I have constantly heard, over and over again, that there is too much Co2 in the atmosphere. The problem with this statement is that it is just plain wrong. Comparing the amount of Co2 we have in the atmosphere now (400 parts per million, ppm for short) and we have had in the last 650 million years shows that now we are in a Co2 starved era.

    <t>If you wanted a serious debate then you would not have ignored my entire argument. So I guess since you are not paying attention to my arguments I will just have to disprove yours instead of adding to my own.  You firstly say that, quot;The temperature has increased .87 Celsius.quot; This is true, but you forgot to mention that the warming period that caused this rise started in the 1700apos;s before the industrial revolution. In addition to this, the world has been naturally warming for the last 20,000 years. You ignored large amounts of scientific data in your argument and made a claim that I agree with. The world IS WARMING!!! It just is not caused by man.  https://conscioustourism.files.wordpress.com...  According to your second argument, Co2 is at 400 ppm. This is true, but there has been no substantial warming for the last 20 years which is proof of how temperature and Co2 act independently. In addition to this, 25% of all Co2 released by man has been released during the last 20 year period. This in itself disproves your claim.  http://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com...  In addition to this, Co2 has been at much higher levels in the past. To restate what I said above, quot;Comparing the amount of Co2 we have in the atmosphere now (400 parts per million, ppm for short) and we have had in the last 650 million years shows that now we are in a Co2 starved era. For example, look at this graph: http://www.paulmacrae.com...... Keep in mind that this graph only goes back 650 million years. Co2 has been over 10000 ppm in the past and temperature had been relatively low at that time.quot;  There may be a clear and strong positive correlation between Co2 and temperature but this correlation has been weak compared to that of sun spots. For the majority of the 1900apos;s sun spots correlated MORE STRONGLY to temperature then Co2 did. This means that sun spots had a bigger impact then Co2 on the temperature. Yes, I know that sun spot numbers dropped around the early 2000s but that is irrelevant because for the majority of the 1900apos;s, when tons and tons of Co2 were released, the temperature was affected more by sun spots then it was by Co2. Another thing to point out, when sun spot numbers started to drop is when the flat line in temperature began.  http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu...  http://geoffair.net...  In actual statistics, according to Joe Bastardi, Co2 has a correlation strength to temperature of just .43 (1895-2007). Other sources say that the correlation strength is just .07 or .02 (1998-2007). Compare this correlation strength to the correlation strength of sunspots and the ocean, .57 (1900-2004) and .85 (1900-2007)  http://i0.wp.com...  http://inspirehep.net...  https://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com...  In conclusion, not only have you ignored the majority of my first argument, you state claims that I am not even trying to disprove. You obviously donapos;t understand what I am trying to debate or donapos;t know how to debate my claims. In addition to this, you gave almost no evidence to support your claims, only sources of where you got the information. If you want to have a real debate, maybe reading my arguments would help.

    <t>Thank you for being honest and admitting you donapos;t understand my arguments. Many people would not do that and it is a very honorable thing to do. I strongly encourage you to do your own research into both sides of the argument. That is what I did and ultimately found that the con side has a better argument.  Two things that could help you get started in your research into the con side are these YouTube videos: 1. The Great Global Warming Swindle Full Movie ( I know this is long but if you have the time then watch at least some of it)  2.

His first observation states that he will debate that humans are contributing to the already natural processes but my question is contributing how much. There is not doubt in my mind that Co2 causes warming. The question is whether this warming is significant or not. To clarify, I believe the warming Co2 creates is insignificant and barely has an effect on climate.  His second observation states that quoting a scientific consensus is science. He is correct in saying that a consensus is more scientific then a home experiment but a scientific paper or research article is better then both. Especially when there is so much controversy about the validity of the consensus.  My opponent then addresses my first argument and states, quot;I will provide empirical evidence that in fact it has a huge impact if not the biggestquot; yet he provides no evidence after this claim.  I run into the same problem when he addresses my second claim. He says, quot; there is other evidence that proves CO2 does have an impactquot; while providing NO scientific evidence. (keep in mind that correlations do NOT show causation so giving a graph of temperature and Co2 rising is not sufficient evidence) He also says that computer models are not always going to be 100% correct which is true but you would expect the predictions made by said models to be closer to the observations. The fact that only a small majority of the models show similar trends to our observations indicate that something is wrong with the models.  In my opponents addressing of my third statement, he makes a valid case, pointing out the fact that Co2 increases atmospheric humidity but disregards the fact that water vapor then condenses into clouds which then reflect heat and light energy away from the earth, therefore cooling it down. I mentioned this at the end of my argument under the label, quot;The Final proofquot; where I explained how cosmic rays cause cooling and why this disproves the greenhouse effect.  My opponent then says, quot;my opponent is stating we would need more CO2 to see an impact.quot; Although I did not state this before, I do agree with this statement. My opponent says this is a unscientific claim but ignores that planets, such as Venus, with extraordinary high (96%) levels of Co2 in their atmosphere are warmer because of it. Nasa says that venus would not be as hot as it is without Co2 or methane.  My opponent also says there is an undoubted correlation between Co2 and warming but this statement depends on what time period you are looking at. For example, according to Joe Bastardi, Co2 has a correlation strength to temperature of just .43 (1895-2007). Other sources say that the correlation strength is just .07 or .02 (1998-2007). according to Joe Bastardi, Co2 has a correlation strength to temperature of just .43 (1895-2007). Compare this correlation strength to the correlation strength of sunspots and the ocean, .57 (1900-2004) and .85 (1900-2007). As you can see, the correlation strength of Co2 compared to other correlations is anything but strong. Another thing to point out is that over longer periods of time, Co2 has almost no correlation to temperature. I meant to put this graph in my argument above but I posted the wrong link so here is the evidence supporting my claim: http://www.paulmacrae.com...  Then my opponent states the Co2 has not been higher then today within the last 800,000 years. This is true, but there is a problem this points out. The temperature HAS been higher then today. This just proves that temperature acts independent of Co2. Co2 has not been higher then today while temperature has risen up to 4 degrees Celsius hotter then today. http://jonova.s3.amazonaws.com...  Then, in my opponents fifth point, he states, quot;Today though, we are seeing this clearly attributed to CO2 in the air from humans as the temperature goes beyond what would be seen as natural.quot; This is just an untrue statement. The majority of the worlds lifespan has been spent with no ice on the poles and the dinosaurs lived in an environment that was much hotter then today. Also, as I mentioned earlier, in the past 1000 years, during the medieval warming period, temperature was 2 degrees Celsius warmer then today and that was only in the last 1000 years!  Thanks for acknowledging that the political arguments are irrelevant, I have argued with many people about this topic before and the political arguments always come up so I wanted to include some just to ward people off if that is what they were planning to debate.  In my opponents case he just states everything that I have already disproven.  He says greenhouse gasses cause warming but Co2 is a very weak greenhouse gas and there is not much of it in the atmosphere.  He says humans are netting 15 gigatons of Co2 into the atmosphere which is true but he doesnapos;t explain why, if there is so much Co2 in the air, there has been no significant warming in the last 2 decades. Especially when 25% of all human caused Co2 emissions occurred during that time period. Another problem is that the chart he provided of the carbon cycle is wrong. I have seen charts like it before and the problem with them is that they donapos;t explain rises in Co2, sometimes over periods of millions of years, in the past. According to that chart, Co2 would be on a constant decline. We know this is not true because looking at a graph he provided us (http://assets.climatecentral.org...) Co2 is constantly in balance with the environment. It is not on an overall decrease.  To my opponents final message, I donapos;t know why the atmosphere is warming if it is not caused by Co2. I am not even going to try and come up with other reasons because the climate is constantly changing and to complex for me to completely understand. I have seen the video you sent me, along with all the other videos in that college course. The problem with the video is that it relies on the idea that Co2 causes warming. Without any significant warming affects, how do they know the quot;fingerprintquot; it leaves? This just causes a loop back to the debate about whether it actually causes warming or not.  After reading your responses and acknowledging the claims you have made, I see no real scientific evidence of man-made global warming. Yes, there are correlations and yes, there are consensuses, but none of these are true pieces of evidence. True evidence would be performing a controlled experiment and testing only 1 variable at a time. As I explained in my first argument, this is not possible.  In conclusion, I await your next argument and wish you the best of luck in debating me.</t>

    <t>My opponent kept mentioning that I was making claims without backing them. I was unclear but thatapos;s because my case was at the bottom and had gone over that evidence. To eliminate as much confusion as possible I will add all that evidence with those statements that appeared to have none.  My evidence that CO2 has a huge impact is here:  1: My opponent has acknowledged that CO2 is a green house gas. Green house gasses cause global warming.  2: humans are netting 15 gigatons of carbon into the atmosphere that has no place in the carbon cycle. Prior to industry all carbon fit into the cycle. https://www.newscientist.com......  3: If CO2 causes warming, and humans are omitting extra CO2 that we are having an impact on climate. Thus I hold my claim that humans are impacting climate change.  Of course my opponent clarified that the real debate is how much CO2 has an impact and whether it is miniscule. So they would say some measure that CO2 is a major player in changing the climate. That evidence is in trends in the atmosphere where lower layers are heating up and upper layers are not. This is a sign of CO2 causing the heating.  On top of that, use my opponents point that if venus didnapos;t have as much CO2 they would be significantly cooler. This proves that there is significant correlation between CO2 and climate. Then throw in how much CO2 humans throw into the atmosphere and what trends we are seeing now and conclude for yourself.  This all rest the case that climate change is being effected by men. My opponent is probably going to argue that they need to see cold hard numbers, but this is not grounds to throw out the logic I have provided. Its impossible to measure with certainty exactly how much people are impacting. But the logic is there and evidence does point to CO2 being the main cause.  Also, just in case my opponent isnapos;t sure that CO2 is coming from people, I ask he or she look to this evidence again that shows the carbon cycle was working naturally until industrial CO2 overloaded it. https://www.newscientist.com...  My opponent is always saying that the correlation is not strong. For this just keep in mind the physical signs we are seeing that it is CO2 such as the atmospheric patterns of heating showing that CO2 is the cause of this, not other signs. It doesnapos;t get much more scientific.  My opponent writes quot;Then my opponent states the Co2 has not been higher then today within the last 800,000 years.

Of course the graph they is of one place which is a spotlight fallacy. You canapos;t point to one location. Also the largest difference in temperatures is in 7 degrees Fahrenheit over the past 10,000 years.  When my opponent quotes me saying the temperature todays is unnatural, they misunderstood my point.  I wasnapos;t saying that extreme temperatures havenapos;t occurred naturally. I meant that we would expect the dramatic changes to be much further apart. In the years before the recent era major changes in climate were rare and on somewhat of a cycle of hot to cold and back with even spacing of time. now we are seeing changes much more erratically and quickly.  My opponent is arguing that man made climate change has not been proven with fool proof certainty and has turned this into an evidence debate. So far this debate has been a debate of clashing evidence that cancel out each-others claims. There has been a lot of research on each side that can just as reliably disprove the other. At this point it is time to look to logical claims and each side ought to put up some logic to the claim.  I have given a clear thought process as to why men and women have had an impact on the climate. I would like to see logical sequential ideas that lead to the notion that climate change must be all natural.  Thanks for this debate to this point so far. (:</t>

    <t>First I would like to thank my opponent for the opportunity for this debate,  I would like to start by making a few observations: 1) I am arguing that the human race has had a measurable impact on global warming. I acknowledge that natural climate change does happen. I will debate that humans are contributing to recent global warming. 2) My opponent says that quoting a consensus is not science. However, it has to be seen that a scientific study by real scientists is going to be more reliable than some kind of theory or home conducted experiment.  Before we begin I would just like to ask for evidence behind the claims in point 3 just for reference.  I will begin by analyzing my opponents case and then move on to my own.  My opponents 1st point states that there is no hard proof that CO2 from humans is the most important part to causing global warming. Even if itapos;s not the MOST important part, if humans have any impact than we are changing the climate from what is natural. I will provide empirical evidence that in fact it has a huge impact if not the biggest.  2: My opponent argues that the computer models donapos;t work. Even if this is true, there is other evidence that proves CO2 does have an impact. Also, computer models are just a way of prediction and we canapos;t expect them to be 100% correct.  3: My opponent argued that CO2 is a weak greenhouse gas. My opponent argues that water vapor has a stronger green house effect. Even if this is true, adding CO2 to the atmosphere is actually a cause for more humid atmosphere making it worse. So even if you believe my opponent that it is actually the water vapor that is the more disastrous greenhouse gas, this problem stems from CO2 also, which stems from humans. http://www.nasa.gov...  Basically my opponent is stating we would need more CO2 to see an impact which is not a scientific claim and there is an undoubted correlation between CO2 and warming.  4: In response to my opponents claim that their is less CO2 now than ever before, according to Freedman at climate central, quot;CO2 levels are far higher now than they have been for anytime during the past 800,000 years.quot; http://www.climatecentral.org...  Also, from NASA. quot;atmospheric carbon dioxide does naturally fluctuate, but itapos;s never been has high as it is todayquot; http://globalclimate.ucr.edu... (i would recommend looking at this graph for the link provided!  5: Your statement about the temperature increasing for the past 20,000 years is true, however that was when the last severe cold stage in the climate happened. So naturally the climate is on its way to being warmer.  Today though, we are seeing this clearly attributed to CO2 in the air from humans as the temperature goes beyond what would be seen as natural.  As for the political arguments. That is probably all true, but does not prove that humans donapos;t have to do with global warming.  Now for my case:  1: Humans are altering the climate.  My evidence comes in 3 stages.  1: My opponent has acknowledged that CO2 is a green house gas. Green house gasses cause global warming.  2: humans are netting 15 gigatons of carbon into the atmosphere that has no place in the carbon cycle. Prior to industry all carbon fit into the cycle. https://www.newscientist.com...  3: If CO2 causes warming, and humans are omitting extra CO2 that we are having an impact on climate. Thus I hold my claim that humans are impacting climate change.  Some may still remain skeptical in believing that there are things that may not be CO2 causing global warming. While other causes like volcanic eruptions, or the tilt of the earth have had causes thousands of year ago. We are seeing trends in the the atmoshphere that point to CO2 being the cause as opposed to thermal energy. Check out the video here. https://www.skepticalscience.com...</t>

    <t>My opponents first second and third points state, quot;My opponent has acknowledged that CO2 is a green house gas.

If CO2 causes warming, and humans are omitting extra CO2 that we are having an impact on climate. Thus I hold my claim that humans are impacting climate change.quot;  To respond to this, I would like to bring up the argument that there is not that much Co2 in the atmosphere compared to the Earths past. 15 gigatons sounds like a lot but it compared to the Earths past Co2 has been much higher. http://www.paulmacrae.com... In addition to this, historical evidence shows that Co2 has no correlation to temperature and most ice core data shows that higher temperature causes Co2 increase, not the other way around.  My opponents next claim is that there are significant quot;fingerprintsquot; caused by Co2 induced heating in the atmosphere. This is not a valid point because I am arguing that Co2 doesnapos;t cause enough heat to significantly impact the atmosphere in the way my opponent is describing. This just brings us in a circle back to the argument that is if CO2 causes warming or not.  My opponents next correlation is that since Venus has high Co2 concentrations and it is known that this is why venus is hot it would make sense that we would be seeing the same effects on Earth.  My response to this is that Venusapos;s atmosphere is 96% Co2. This is more then enough Co2 to have a significant impact on its atmosphere. This is drastically different from Earth where only about .03% of our atmosphere is Co2.  I agree that humans are putting Co2 into the atmosphere  My opponent then states that we are seeing rapid climate changes and that this is unnatural about the current climate change. While we are experiencing rapid rates of climate change, these changes are not unique to Earth. The entire solar system seems to be going through a sort of quot;climate-change phase.quot; Within the last 20 years scientists at NASA and around the world have realized that the planets we are looking at now are different than those in 1900s. This indicates that the entire solar system is in some sort of solar-system wide climate change. For example, the ice caps on Mars are shrinking (indicating warming) and the atmosphere is gaining clouds and ozone, Pluto is experiencing a growth of its mysterious dark spots and is experiencing a 300% increase in atmospheric pressure (indicating warming), Saturn is giving off large amount of x rays and there are new appearances of quot;hot spotsquot; in its atmosphere (indicating warming), there have been polar shifts on Uranus and voyager 2 picked up large storm spots In its atmosphere that were not there 50 years ago (indicating warming), Mercury is growing a magnetic field and polar ice caps, Jupiterquot;s plasma clouds melding together in its atmosphere and becoming brighter (this is theorized to have been caused by an 18 degree Celsius warming and this is supported by the new large storm spots appearing on Jupiter for the first time), Venus has had a 2500% increase in green glow which symbolizes oxygen in the atmosphere, and Neptune is experiencing changes in light intensity. A dramatic shift that may be the cause of all these weird interplanetary changes is that the suns magnetic field is increasing in strength. Over the last 100 years, the suns magnetic field has increased by 230%. This increase attracts stardust from the surrounding area and this overflow of stardust may have something to do with this solar-system wide event. This evidence shows how Earth is not the only planet going through a rapid period of climate change. This indicates that something solar-system wide may be to blame for the recent fluctuations in temperature, not Co2.  In addition to this, compared to the past 100,000 years, the rate of temperature increase does not seem to be any more rapid then it has been in the past. For example, look at this graph. https://conscioustourism.files.wordpress.com... In fact, looking at this graph shows that we are seeing even less fluctuations in temperature then we have in the past. This means that the rate of change and increase is unnatural because it is slow, not fast.  I have now disproven all of your claims and look forward to your next argument. No, thank you for the debate :)</t>

For example, the ice caps on Mars are shrinking (indicating warming) and the atmosphere is gaining clouds and ozone, Pluto is experiencing a growth of its mysterious dark spots and is experiencing a 300% increase in atmospheric pressure (indicating warming), Saturn is giving off large amount of x rays and there are new appearances of quot;hot spotsquot; in its atmosphere (indicating warming), there have been polar shifts on Uranus and voyager 2 picked up large storm spots In its atmosphere that were not there 50 years ago (indicating warming), Mercury is growing a magnetic field and polar ice caps, Jupiterquot;s plasma clouds melding together in its atmosphere and becoming brighter (this is theorized to have been caused by an 18 degree Celsius warming and this is supported by the new large storm spots appearing on Jupiter for the first time), Venus has had a 2500% increase in green glow which symbolizes oxygen in the atmosphere, and Neptune is experiencing changes in light intensity. A dramatic shift that may be the cause of all these weird interplanetary changes is that the suns magnetic field is increasing in strength. Over the last 100 years, the suns magnetic field has increased by 230%. This increase attracts stardust from the surrounding area and this overflow of stardust may have something to do with this solar-system wide event. This indicates that something solar-system wide may be to blame for the recent fluctuations in temperature, not Co2. For example, look at this graph.</h>

    <t>My opponent is correct the Earthapos;s temperature has been hotter a long time ago. This falls into the stage 4a of climate change denial.

    <t>In this round I will be refuting my opponentapos;s arguments and I will be resupporting my own arguments My opponent statedquot;First my arguments still stand. I think everyone already knows the Pope is not a climate change scientist.quot;But what my opponent fails to realize is that quoting the pope is not an argument, an argument needs evidence, the quote from the Pope is not evidence of climate change, rather it is only a claim followed by my opponentapos;s warrant. You canapos;t just quote the pope and call it an argument, thus you have no first argument. The Popeapos;s statement does not further your case (unless he was a climate scientist, then it would)So, because the pope is not a climate researcher I really donapos;t even need to refute his statement but I have done so by showing that the Pope is not a climate scientist. In his first rebuttal my opponent stated thatquot;science has shown repeatably that CO2 emissions increase green house gasesquot;, but he shows no specific evidence of this occurring. Then my opponent quotes the EPA quot;The main human activity that emits CO2 is the combustion of fossil fuelsquot; However, if this were true then how come the decade long decrease in CO2 was seen, even as fossil fuel combustion increased (In the US alone 3 billion more barrels were used per year). In fact, my opponent conceded that point when he said quot;Why CO2 levels happen to drop that year is uncertainquot;, so my opponent has conceded my first point. My opponent stated in rebuttal 2quot;Argument two is cherry picking.quot;But he shows no evidence of how it is cherry picking... Thus, this statement ought not to be considered, however I will prove how my second argument was not cherry picking... The definition of cherry picking is quot;When only select evidence is presented in order to persuade the audience to accept a position, and evidence that would go against the position is withheld.quot; [1]However, I have not cherry picked evidence because of the fact that I offered the statistical analysis of two major climate research satellites which have had their results peer reviewed by the scientific community and been found to be accurate. In fact, if I had cherry picked this evidence it would not show the .2 degree warming trend that it did...What is even more ironic is that my opponent goes on to say quot;El Nino was responsible for the height of the graph.quot; But even I conceded that the warming trend was there, in fact my opponent just contradicted his entire case by calling the warming trend that was apparent on the graph; El Nino, a regional, natural phenomena, that has nothing to do with Global Climate Change. So, if El Nino caused the warming trend on the graph, then Global Warming is a hoax because all warming trends over the period of the graph can be explained by El Nino (He said it, I didnapos;t). My opponent in rebuttal 3 stated quot;First, any argument that tries to use a regional phenomenon to disprove a global trend is dead in the water. Anthropogenic global warming theory does not predict uniform warming throughout the globe. We need to assess the balance of the evidence.quot;By definition if the phenomena is not experienced GLOBALLY, then GLOBAL Climate Change is not occurring [1] (simple definition 1)quot;Second, ice-sheet thickening is not inconsistent with warming! Warmer climates tend toward more precipitation. The Antarctic is one of the most extreme deserts on the planet. As it warms, we would expect it to receive more snow. But even a whopping warming of 20 degrees quot; say, from -50 degrees C to -30 degrees C quot; would still leave it below freezing, so the snow wouldnapos;tquot;t melt. Thus, an increase in ice mass.quot;If this is true then how come one of the biggest proponents of Global Warming said that the poles would be ice free by 2013 [2], Leon Penetta once said [while talking about Global Climate Change] quot;The melting of the Polar Ice Capsquot; [3]. There seems to be a consensus among scientists and Global Warming Theorists that the Ice caps will melt when Global Warming occurs. Then How did my opponent find contradictory evidence? He found such evidence because he quoted a man with 0 climate science experience. His sources 4,5, and 6 are written by Coby Beck quot;Former musician, turned tree planter, turned software engineer.quot; [4] So, any quote by him ought to be ignored because it offers no expert value or value of any sort. In fact, my opponent is not even quoting the credible science in some of Beckapos;s blogs, my opponent is quoting Beckapos;s opinions which hold no value. My opponent in his 4th rebuttal quotes the same man again... and his statement ought to be ignored but in another one of my opponentapos;s contradictory statements, he says quot;temperature moved first [in relation to CO2]quot;, but if this is true, then how come the IPCC said that CO2 caused temperature to move? Which one is it? Either way my opponent has contradicted Global Warming theory as we are debating it and has negated his own refutation. My opponentapos;s graph is quite interesting. The graph appears to show a correlation between CO2 and Temperature, however there are several occasions of temperature and CO2 acting independently, one major example is 400k years before present when the temperature increased dramatically for a (relatively) short period while CO2 decreased, and then again around 380k years ago where temperature decreased dramatically while CO2 increased. So, my opponentapos;s chart, however intriguing, shows once again, that temperature and CO2 act independently from one another. Now I will Strengthen my original cases1: Fossil Fuels do not cause an increase in CO2 emissions, which makes the first part of the IPCCapos;s basic version of global warming invalidMy opponent has conceded this point (see above for more details)2: Despite common belief the last few years have not been the warmest on recordI have shown my opponentapos;s rebuttal of this claim to be false, and his claim of a logical fallacy to be false, however Iapos;d like to strengthen this point more. USCRN the largest and most advanced climate research network in the US has shown a decade long cooling trend. While the trend is statistically 0, it still shows no evidence of global warming. If the entire world is warming, (definition of Global Warming, see above) then how come the United States isnapos;t? [5]s://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com...; alt=quot;quot; width=quot;1005quot; height=quot;551quot; /gt;Furthering my point, A large integrated network of Argo ocean buoys operated by the British Oceanographic Data Center in combination with satellite-enhanced data reveal no statistical warming. Again I posit the question, If the world is warming, then how come the US AND Britain (and the surrounding ocean) are not. [6] 3: Antarctic Ice was larger than ever in 2012 and 2014, thus the Antarctic Ice caps have not been melting which is thought to be a sideffect of the Global Warming theorySeeing as my opponentapos;s refutation of this point was insufficient, I do not feel the need to strengthen this point. 4: There is no direct link between CO2 Emissions and Temperature IncreasesAs I have refuted my opponentapos;s statements about this point Iapos;d like to point out that my opponent has neglected to mention both of my charts for this point, both of which show an obvious independence between CO2 and Temperature, even over the time span of millions of years of data. Judges, seeing as my opponent has not fulfilled his BoP at this point in the debate you would be required to vote in favor of the Con. I look forward to reading my opponentapos;s next argument, and Iapos;d like to say that Iapos;m enjoying this debate.

    <t>Thank you for posting this debate, I hope to be a worthy opponent!!!!Your argument is based on the popeapos;s opinion as well as a scientific documentaryMy argument will be based on historical evidence as well as current scientific evidence that contradicts the theory of Global Climate ChangeFirst Iapos;d like to clarify that Global Warming and Global Climate Change are the same theory with a different name and I will treat them as such. First, Iapos;d like to define Global Climate Change (or Warming)Thus the theory of Global Climate Change (warming) is - a change in global climate patterns, in particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onward and attributed to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels.Iapos;d like to give a more simplified version of the above statement by giving this general statement released by the IPCC on what Climate Change is quot;Increasing fossil fuel causes increasing carbon dioxide in the air; and increasing carbon dioxide in the air causes climate change.quot;Next, Iapos;d like to refute my opponentapos;s argumentsArgument 1) Pope Francis recognizes climate change and he quot;Knows what he is doing and thus man-made global climate change is real and a threatquot; My Response: Pope Francis has no college degree in science (he does have a quot;tituloquot; as a chemical technician, which is not a college degree) and either way he is not a climatologist and his opinion does not count as an expertapos;s opinion and his opinion is on par with the opinion of world leaders and celebrities... Essentially, his opinion on climate change is just as important as the opinion of Vladimir Putinapos;s, neither count as an expert, but their opinionapos;s count as a World Leaderapos;s opinion. Argument 2) An Inconvenient Truth My Response: I will watch the entirety of this movie so I can refute the movie in my next argumentNow I will give my basic arguments1: Fossil Fuels do not cause an increase in CO2 emissions, which makes the first part of the IPCCapos;s basic version of global warming invalidDuring World War II, U.S. oil production increased by 3 billion barrels annually during the war. Both the Allies and the Axis used incredible amounts of oil and the best scientific data available, which is from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, shows that carbon dioxide levels literally quot;flat-linedquot; during the decade between 1940 and 1950 staying at 311.3 PPM and actually going down between 1941 and 1945, (the period that the US was in the war) [1] So, how did burning another 12+ billion barrels of oil not increase CO2???? Because, there is no direct link between oil usage and CO2 emissions in the atmosphere. Of course CO2 is a byproduct of the burning of oil, but that CO2 has had little to no affect on atmospheric CO2 as seen in my example above.2: Despite common belief the last few years have not been the warmest on record... According to the UAH and RSS climate research satellites there had been no warming between the late 90apos;s and 2015 in fact 2014, was only .01 degrees hotter than 2005, and 2013 was only .02 degrees warmer than 2005. The conclusion from the analysis of the data is that while there has been a .05 degree warming trend since 2002, according to researchers that is quot;statistically insignificantquot; [2] The small upward trend from 1978 to 2015 is .2 degrees Celsius and is once again classifiable as statistically insignificant and is not proof of any man made global warming, in fact the lack of a significant upward trend shows not only that global warming predictions on climate and temperatures have been well off, but that there may not be any man made global warming at all. (excuse the site on the chart, woodfortrees.org is not where I got the chart, the source I used for the chart is the one listed as source 2)3: Antarctic Ice was larger than ever in 2012 and 2014, thus the Antarctic Ice caps have not been melting which is thought to be a sideffect of the Global Warming theoryNASA satillites discovered that the antarctic sea ice had reached a new record high in 2012 and then again in 2014, in 2014 it set a record for the largest Antarctic Sea Ice in recorded history [3]. Global Warming theory dictates that the Ice caps would begin to melt at an alarming rate, but if thatapos;s the case then how come this has occurred. In fact Al Gore and many Global Warming theorists stated that the ice caps would be completley gone by 2013, when the exact opposite has occurred.The red line in the photo is the largest that the ice had ever been recorded at.4: There is no direct link between CO2 Emissions and Temperature Increaseslook at both of the below charts, the first chart is CO2 and temperature data for the last 750 million years, each blue dot represents the temperature and CO2 levels. What you can see is that the dots are everywhere and seemingly when CO2 is raised the dots tend to be higher, but there are several dots (call them outliers if you wish) that even nearing 5000 PPM CO2 are still cooler than the average Earth Temperature. On top of this, why are there dots near the 1000 PPM range that are higher up on the anomaly range than the dots at 7000 PPM.The Second chart shows CO2 and Temperature from 1999 to 2014, what can be seen is a very, very small trend line which is again considered Statistically Insignificant, showing no proof of a global climate change. (specifically the trend is .00668, which is essentially 0 to statisticians) [4]s://s17.postimg.io...; alt=quot;quot; /gt;s://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com...; alt=quot;quot; /gt;Both Charts show a lack of evidence with CO2 and Temperature, In fact, it could be said that there is no correlation between CO2 and Temperature Change. However IPCCapos;s definition of Global Climate Change requires such a correlation and if such a correlation is not apparent than Climate Change theory is flawed and thus Global Climate Change would not exist. So, based on all 4 of my points I am in firm negation of the topic in which we are debating. Thank you for reading this argument and looking at my charts!!! I hope you understood it, and I canapos;t to see your next round.Iapos;d like to remind my opponent of his BoP, which because of him being the pro he must prove specifically that Man Made Climate change is real and a threat he must prove this beyond a shadow of a doubt, my BoP is not to disprove Climate Change but rather to cast a shadow of a doubt, similar to a court case the judges must not have ANY SHADOW OF A DOUBT that he has won or they must give me the victory.Sources: [1]http://data.giss.nasa.gov...[2]http://dailycaller.com...[3]http://www.nasa.gov...[4]https://wattsupwiththat.com...In case the charts/pics dont show up...

<h>    Thank you for posting this debate, I hope to be a worthy opponent!!!!Your argument is based on the popeapos;s opinion as well as a scientific documentaryMy argument will be based on historical evidence as well as current scientific evidence that contradicts the theory of Global Climate ChangeFirst Iapos;d like to clarify that Global Warming and Global Climate Change are the same theory with a different name and I will treat them as such. First, Iapos;d like to define Global Climate Change (or Warming)Thus the theory of Global Climate Change (warming) is - a change in global climate patterns, in particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onward and attributed to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels.Iapos;d like to give a more simplified version of the above statement by giving this general statement released by the IPCC on what Climate Change is quot;Increasing fossil fuel causes increasing carbon dioxide in the air; and increasing carbon dioxide in the air causes climate change.quot;Next, Iapos;d like to refute my opponentapos;s argumentsArgument 1) Pope Francis recognizes climate change and he quot;Knows what he is doing and thus man-made global climate change is real and a threatquot; My Response: Pope Francis has no college degree in science (he does have a quot;tituloquot; as a chemical technician, which is not a college degree) and either way he is not a climatologist and his opinion does not count as an expertapos;s opinion and his opinion is on par with the opinion of world leaders and celebrities. Essentially, his opinion on climate change is just as important as the opinion of Vladimir Putinapos;s, neither count as an expert, but their opinionapos;s count as a World Leaderapos;s opinion. Argument 2) An Inconvenient Truth My Response: I will watch the entirety of this movie so I can refute the movie in my next argumentNow I will give my basic arguments1: Fossil Fuels do not cause an increase in CO2 emissions, which makes the first part of the IPCCapos;s basic version of global warming invalidDuring World War II, U.S. oil production increased by 3 billion barrels annually during the war. Both the Allies and the Axis used incredible amounts of oil and the best scientific data available, which is from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, shows that carbon dioxide levels literally quot;flat-linedquot; during the decade between 1940 and 1950 staying at 311.3 PPM and actually going down between 1941 and 1945, (the period that the US was in the war) [1] So, how did burning another 12+ billion barrels of oil not increase CO2. Because, there is no direct link between oil usage and CO2 emissions in the atmosphere. Of course CO2 is a byproduct of the burning of oil, but that CO2 has had little to no affect on atmospheric CO2 as seen in my example above.2: Despite common belief the last few years have not been the warmest on record. According to the UAH and RSS climate research satellites there had been no warming between the late 90apos;s and 2015 in fact 2014, was only .01 degrees hotter than 2005, and 2013 was only .02 degrees warmer than 2005. The conclusion from the analysis of the data is that while there has been a .05 degree warming trend since 2002, according to researchers that is quot;statistically insignificantquot; [2] The small upward trend from 1978 to 2015 is .2 degrees Celsius and is once again classifiable as statistically insignificant and is not proof of any man made global warming, in fact the lack of a significant upward trend shows not only that global warming predictions on climate and temperatures have been well off, but that there may not be any man made global warming at all. (excuse the site on the chart, woodfortrees.org is not where I got the chart, the source I used for the chart is the one listed as source 2)3: Antarctic Ice was larger than ever in 2012 and 2014, thus the Antarctic Ice caps have not been melting which is thought to be a sideffect of the Global Warming theoryNASA satillites discovered that the antarctic sea ice had reached a new record high in 2012 and then again in 2014, in 2014 it set a record for the largest Antarctic Sea Ice in recorded history [3]. Global Warming theory dictates that the Ice caps would begin to melt at an alarming rate, but if thatapos;s the case then how come this has occurred. In fact Al Gore and many Global Warming theorists stated that the ice caps would be completley gone by 2013, when the exact opposite has occurred.The red line in the photo is the largest that the ice had ever been recorded at.4: There is no direct link between CO2 Emissions and Temperature Increaseslook at both of the below charts, the first chart is CO2 and temperature data for the last 750 million years, each blue dot represents the temperature and CO2 levels. What you can see is that the dots are everywhere and seemingly when CO2 is raised the dots tend to be higher, but there are several dots (call them outliers if you wish) that even nearing 5000 PPM CO2 are still cooler than the average Earth Temperature. On top of this, why are there dots near the 1000 PPM range that are higher up on the anomaly range than the dots at 7000 PPM.The Second chart shows CO2 and Temperature from 1999 to 2014, what can be seen is a very, very small trend line which is again considered Statistically Insignificant, showing no proof of a global climate change. (specifically the trend is .00668, which is essentially 0 to statisticians) [4]s://s17.postimg.io...; alt=quot;quot; /gt;s://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com...; alt=quot;quot; /gt;Both Charts show a lack of evidence with CO2 and Temperature, In fact, it could be said that there is no correlation between CO2 and Temperature Change. I hope you understood it, and I canapos;t to see your next round.Iapos;d like to remind my opponent of his BoP, which because of him being the pro he must prove specifically that Man Made Climate change is real and a threat he must prove this beyond a shadow of a doubt, my BoP is not to disprove Climate Change but rather to cast a shadow of a doubt, similar to a court case the judges must not have ANY SHADOW OF A DOUBT that he has won or they must give me the victory.Sources: [1]http://data.giss.nasa.gov...[2]http://dailycaller.com...[3]http://www.nasa.gov...[4]https://wattsupwiththat.com...In case the charts/pics dont show up.</h>

    <t>My opponent stated thatquot;First and foremost, my opponent has dropped the issue of the Inconvenient truth documentaryquot; However, my entire case has been in contradiction to the inconvenient truth documentary, as seen when my opponent states quot;scientific evidence clearly backs up this claim in the documentary an inconvenient truthquot;, I have offered scientific in direct contradiction to the scientific evidence in the movie, thus I have negated my opponentapos;s ENTIRE argument. quot; As for the Popeapos;s contribution, this shows just how much climate change deniers are within the minority.quot;Seeing as my opponent likes to spew out the term quot;fallacyquot;, I will spew out the term band wagon fallacy which this argument is, because The bandwagon fallacy is committed by arguments that appeal to the growing popularity of an idea as a reason for accepting it as true. My opponent has admitted to doing this by sating that quot;climate change deniers are within the minorityquot; In my opponentapos;s (rather short) rebuttal he said that I was cherry picking again (in my first argument) He did show that I chose a time fame that best suits me, but that time frame that best suits me shows a DIRECT INDEPENDENCE between oil consumption and CO2 in the atmosphere. This isnapos;t cherry picking because I didnapos;t just show a single year or two of independence I showed an entire decade of data. Not only this, but in my 3rd graph (on my first argument) I showed how CO2 levels has been extremely higher than weapos;ve ever seen in humanityapos;s history (in some cases over 8000 PPM well before the industrial revolution). Once again I showed independence between ATMOSPHERIC CO2 and Fossil Fuel Consumption. My opponent doesnapos;t seem to understand my argument that ATMOSPHERIC CO2 has no direct relationship to fossil fuel consumption, he lists the obvious fact that CO2 is released by the burning of fossil fuels, but shows no explanation to why an entire decade (and more) of data shows no relation between fossil fuel consumption and atmospheric CO2, in fact he drops the point in his second argument when he says he cannot explain why this statistic occurred. My opponentapos;s second rebuttal statesquot;My opponent seems to miss the original claim he/she made. I have shown that the overall trend is upwards. El nino was particularly potent in the spike of the graph.quot;I havenapos;t forgotten any claims that I have made, however my opponent has not shown anything contrary to my original claim, his only counter argument negates his entire argument when my opponent blames the spike in temperature on El Nino, a climate feature unrelated to Global Warming. But again even I admitted there was a slight warming trend since 1978, but if the El Nino spike is removed from the data the trend disappears, so my opponent admits that Global Warming is not the cause of the temperature since 1978. My opponentapos;s third rebuttal states quot;The overall tend is hotter. Climate can be difficult to predict, just because not everything predicted came true at the correct time, doesnapos;t destroy the overall premise is false.quot;However I have shown 3 different examples of a lack of an overall warming trend. My first example being my 1st chart on my first argument, which shows that GLOBALLY the overall warming trend (that there is) is quot;statistically insignificantquot; (since 1978). My second example shows that in the US temperatures are cooling over the last decade. My third example shows that in the North and East Atlantic Ocean, as well as, the British Isles have not experienced any warming. My opponentapos;s fourth rebuttal statesquot;The graph clearly indicates that Co2 and temperature show a strong positive relationship. Yes, there are a few anomalies but that doesnapos;t discredit the theory.quot;My opponent has offered one singular graph showing a relationship between CO2 and temperature. However, I have pointed out that there are events on his graph that shows an independence between the two variables, on top of this, I have offered TWICE as much evidence in the contrary, which my opponent has neglected to mention, showing independence between the two variables even over millions of years. Again Iapos;d like to crystalize my arguments1: Fossil Fuels do not cause an increase in CO2 emissions, which makes the first part of the IPCCapos;s basic version of global warming invalidMy opponent has not other a sufficient refutation for this argument, because this point refutes the definition of Global Warming, it proves that, as we are debating it, Global Warming is not real and thus not a threat.2: Despite common belief the last few years have not been the warmest on record... My opponent calls this point quot;cherry pickingquot; however as I have proven, this is not true, and because my opponent has not offered contrary evidence and because of that this point still stands3: Antarctic Ice was larger than ever in 2012 and 2014, thus the Antarctic Ice caps have not been melting which is thought to be a sideffect of the Global Warming theoryMy opponentapos;s first reputation was to say that the ice caps would not melt if Global Warming occurred, however I have shown that this is false, then my opponent made a refutation that is not in contradiction to anything that I stated, so this point still stands.4: There is no direct link between CO2 Emissions and Temperature IncreasesMy opponent has neglected to mention either of my graphs and my opponentapos;s evidence has been refuted making this point still relevant in this debate. Now Iapos;d like to show why I have won this debate My opponentapos;s arguments have been proven false or a fallacy. My opponentapos;s first quot;pointquot; is the popeapos;s quote which Iapos;ve shown to be worth no value to this debate, and I have proven it to be a bandwagon fallacy. My opponentapos;s second point is the Inconvenient Truth Movie which posits scientific evidence for the theory of Global Warming, However, my entire case is in direct contradiction to this movie and acts as counter evidence and a rebuttal to the movie. So, because both of my opponentapos;s arguments have been proven wrong, and my opponentapos;s refutations have been untrue and unfounded, and I have proven them to be so, Thus, I have won this debate... Judges must vote in favor of the Con because of the overwhelming amount of evidence presented and the lack of evidence for my opponent.  Iapos;d like to thank my opponent for this fun and enlightening debate.</t>

    <t>RebuttalsFirst my arguments still stand. I think everyone already knows the Pope is not a climate change scientist. Opponentapos;s arguments.1.
