    <t>There is so much on this issue I don't know what to explain first.  Fact 1: There has been no significant atmospheric warming since 1998. In addition to this, there has been a lack of an atmospheric hotspot (in the mid to upper troposphere) that was predicted to be caused by greenhouse gas caused warming. This in itself proves that greenhouse gasses are not causing the recent warming trend. No warming 1: No warming 2: Lack of hotspot 1: https://mises.org... Lack of hotspot 2: (Specifically on pg 6 but I suggest you read more)  Fact 2: Co2 is an extraordinarily weak greenhouse gas. According to atomic absorption spectroscopy, it can only store and release 7% of the electromagnetic spectrum that passes through it.  Fact 3: Throughout Earths history, Co2 has been much higher in the past showing that recent levels of Co2 are harmless. Fact 4: Recently, ice core data shows that Co2 followed temperature, sometimes by hundreds of years, not the other way around. Lags warming 1: https://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com... Lags warming 2: Fact 5: Co2 has never caused amplification of warming in the past. It is simple logic. If Co2 amplified temperature after orbital changes raised the temperature first, when would the amplification stop? The answer is when there is no more Co2 in the oceans. This would cause the oceans to become abnormally basic and this has only happened once in the last 25 million years: Ocean pH 25 million years: https://www.manicore.com... (I know it shows acidification at the end but this does not contradict my argument because it is a different result of more Co2.)  Fact 6: Almost every single computer model made by the IPCC is wrong. This suggests something fundamentally wrong with the models used. In addition, the models are all wrong because they predict to much heat which suggests that the effect of Co2 is being overblown. Computer models wrong 1: https://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com... Computer models wrong 2: Fact 7: The Earth has been warming for 15000 (or 
0) years. Warming for 15000 (or 20000 it depends on the data) years:  Fact 8: In the last 8000 years, we have had 4 major global warm periods naturally. We had the medieval warm period, the roman warm period, the Minoan warm period and the Holocene maximum. All major warm periods: Medieval warm period was global 1:  Medieval warm period was global 2:  Fact 9: All major planet bodies in our solar system are experiencing rapid climate change, indicating that the heating on Earth could be caused by something in the solar system, not the planet.  Mars: Ice caps are shrinking, two pictures showed possible warming (these could be unreliable due to dust storms), atmosphere is gaining clouds, ozone and water vapor (indicating warming).  Pluto: Mysterious dark spots are becoming larger, atmospheric pressure increased by 300% (indicating warming)  Saturn: Giving off x-rays, growing storm spots and other hot spots in its atmosphere (indicating warming)  Uranus: Polar shifts, 2 large storms spots that were not there 50 years ago (indicating warming)  Mercury: Gaining a magnetic field, polar ice caps growing (indicating cooling)  Jupiter: Plasma clouds merging together and growing new storm spots (indicating an 18 degree Celsius warming)  Venus: 2500% increase in green glow indicating more oxygen in its atmosphere  Neptune: Weird changes in light intensity.  Earth: Rapid warming  As you can see, every major planet in our solar system is experiencing rapid climate change. Scientists theorize that this is due to increased amounts of energy in the space around our solar system.  Fact 10: There is no scientific way to test whether Co2 causes global warming. Yes, Co2 is a greenhouse gas and traps warmth, I am not denying that. What we haven't tested is whether this warmth has a great enough impact to trump all other factors that influence climate. For example, ocean currents, cosmic rays, sun irradiance, the sun spot cycle, Earth's magnetic field, Earth's orbit, Earth's tilt, Volcanos, etc' all effect the climate. Why is Co2 more important than all of these factors? Let's find out! Oh, wait, you can't. This is where you reach a problem. How do you find out? You can't, scientifically, create a real, controlled experiment to test whether Co2 has a bigger impact than any of these other factors. This means that the entire idea that Co2 causes climate change is based on computer models and it can't actually be tested. This shows that the idea that Co2 causes warming is less science then it is religion because you are putting your faith in a computer model rather than observing and recording data. Keep in mind that simple correlations do not qualify as scientific data.  Fact 11: During the post economic boom, when Co2 soared, temperatures fell despite the increase in Co2. This has been blamed on increased sulfur emissions but NASA says, 'the cooling effect of the pollution aerosols will be somewhat regionally dependent, near and downwind of industrial areas' which explains how sulfur would only cause cooling in or around the areas it was released. This means that sulfur could not be responsible for the cooling. Post war economic boom: Co2 levels: https://www3.epa.gov... As you can see, Co2 levels rose dramatically during the post economic boom, past what they had ever been at before, yet temperatures fell.  In conclusion, I have provided 11 facts explaining how Co2 can not, or has never been, a main climate driver. All the historical and recent evidence is stacked against it. While my opponent gives links to a consensus and impacts of possible warming, I have focused on the argument at hand. Explaining why Co2 does not drive climate. While my opponent has made little to no argument, I have shown why the conclusions of the scientists in the consensus he listed were wrong. I thank my opponent for this debate, and may the best man/woman win!</t>

<t>My opponent accepts that his first argument is a correlation so there is no need to strengthen my argument there.  My opponents second argument states, '''When the Earth comes out of an ice age, the warming is not initiated by CO2 but by changes in the Earth's orbit. The warming causes the oceans to release CO2. The CO2 amplifies the warming and mixes through the atmosphere, spreading warming throughout the planet. So CO2 causes warming AND rising temperature causes CO2 rise. Overall, about 90% of the global warming occurs after the CO2 increase.'''  To disprove this I will do it line by line.  Line 1: When the Earth comes out of an ice age, the warming is not initiated by CO2 but by changes in the Earth's orbit This line is true but only in some cases. For example, the mini ice age, which we exited 1000 years ago, was not initiated by changes in the earths orbit.  Line 2: This line is just wrong. The oceans do store Co2 but what is released when they warm is mostly water vapor, not Co2. This water vapor then causes more clouds which then cools the Earth. This is common knowledge among scientists because this is exactly how cosmic rays cause cooling.  Line 3: Yes, rising temperature causes more Co2 to be released but by simply looking at ice core data we can see that this does not cause an infinite rise in temperature. The temperature then drops and rises again independent of the Co2 that was released from the previous rise. For an example, look at this graph: http://www.geocraft.com...  My opponents next argument is just plain wrong. My opponent states, ''Even if we ignore long term trends and just look at the record-breakers, 2015, 2014, 2010, and 2005 were hotter than 1998.  The myth of no warming since 1998 was based on the satellite record estimates of the temperature of the atmosphere. However, as discussed in the video below by Peter Sinclair, even that argument is no longer accurate. The satellites show warming since 1998 too.' '  To disprove this all you need to do is read the caption at the top of the graph below where it lists its source. http://4.bp.blogspot.com... As you can see, the graph was not based on temperature estimates but the 'global mean temperature change...' I don't know where you got the idea that 2015, 2014, 2010, and 2005 were hotter than 1998 but from your sources it seems that this data is only true once you remove the El Nino. My question to you is why hasn't the Earth warmed since the El Nino. In the 20 years since the temperature maximum temperature doesn't increase at all. In addition to this, the El Nino just proves the fact that there are other influences in climate that influence temperature more then Co2 or enough to distort data.  For my opponents next argument he states that my source is not credible. This is just not true. Just because the maker of the website is paid to research evidence against man made global warming does not immediately make all of his evidence untrue. My opponent does not provide any actual contrary evidence to debate this point but to satisfy their needs I will give a link to multiple graphs sourced from other websites showing the same thing. http://c3headlines.typepad.com... http://www.drroyspencer.com... http://i.dailymail.co.uk... http://www.cafeconlecherepublicans.com...  My opponents next argument is not relevant to man made climate change.  My opponents next argument states, 'Not every prediction in the Inconvenient Truth came true. Nevertheless polar bears are struggling and many ice caps are melting. [5]  As for the polar bears this is due to hunting restrictions and bans. '  I will cede this point to my opponent as it is a result of warming and not relevant to man causing the warming. I should not have brought it up and while I still have arguments to dispute it do not wish to argue this view any longer.  As for why the documentary was manipulated, I do not wish to argue this any more either for the same reasons listed above nevertheless I will provide a short article to explain my first argument. I know that the article does not provide much info on the subject but if you really want to understand the argument then you need to research it yourself. http://www.newsmax.com...  Nextl, to strengthen my point of the debate, I will argue that Earth is not the only planet warming. The entire solar system seems to be going through a sort of 'climate-change phase.' Within the last 20 years scientists at NASA and around the world have realized that the planets we are looking at now are different than those in 1900s. This indicates that the entire solar system is in some sort of solar-system wide climate change.  For example, the ice caps on Mars are shrinking (indicating warming) and the atmosphere is gaining clouds and ozone, Pluto is experiencing a growth of its mysterious dark spots and is experiencing a 300% increase in atmospheric pressure (indicating warming), Saturn is giving off large amount of x rays and there are new appearances of 'hot spots' in its atmosphere (indicating warming), there have been polar shifts on Uranus and voyager 2 picked up large storm spots In its atmosphere that were not there 50 years ago (indicating warming), Mercury is growing a magnetic field, Jupiter's 'white ovals' are disappearing and melding together in its atmosphere (this is theorized to have been caused by an 18 degree Celsius warming and this is supported by the new large storm spots appearing on Jupiter for the first time), Venus has had a 2500% increase in green glow which symbolizes oxygen in the atmosphere, and Neptune is experiencing changes in light intensity.  As you can see from the long paragraph I have provided above, the entire Solar System seems to be warming or experiencing some sort of weird climate change patterns. This indicates more then just a global event.  To conclude my argument, I will provide a graph of Co2 and Temperature over the long term that should, on its own, disprove entirely the idea of man-made climate change. http://www.paulmacrae.com...</t>

<t>Global warming is caused by the emission of greenhouse gases . 72% of the totally emitted greenhouse gases is carbon dioxide (CO2), 18% Methane and 9% Nitrous oxide (NOx). Carbon dioxide emissions therefore are the most important cause of global warming. CO2 is inevitably created by burning fuels like e.g. oil, natural gas, diesel, organic-diesel, petrol, organic-petrol, ethanol. The emissions of CO2 have been dramatically increased within the last 50 years and are still increasing by almost 3% each year, see graph below:      Word-wide CO2 emission are steadily increasingGraph 1: CO2-emissions world-wide by year (data from wri.org)  World-wide CO2 emissions and concentrationsGraph 2: CO2 emissions world-wide by year and CO2 concentration in the atmosphere by year  The carbon dioxide is released to the atmosphere where it remains for 100 to 200 years. This leads to an increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere (see above on the right hand side), which in turn causes the average temperature on Earth to raise (see graph below).  Increase of world temperature Chart 3: Increase of global average temperature for the last 20 years (source: wri.org) Recent investigations have shown that inconceivable catastrophic changes in the environment will take place if the global temperatures increase by more than 2° C (3.6° F). A warming of 2° C (3.6° F) corresponds to a carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration of about 450 ppm (parts per million) in the atmosphere.</t>

<t>In fact, over the last decade, the rate of climate change has been declining, despite the fact that we use more Co2 emitting energy sources. Now, I believe that Co2 has a small effect on the climate, but there is simply no evidence saying that we will die. And fossil fuels can be used to make countries stronger in the face of the effects some scientists hypothesise will effect them the most. for instance, fossil fuels can actually be used to make stronger structures and communities that can easily bounce back from devastating natural disasters. For instance, there is a correlation between fossil fuel and clean water, this is because fossil fuel can be used to power refineries and the entire pipe system used to get water to the tap. Now, of course all this energy can be found in other energy sources, such as nuclear and hydroelectric, but I suppose that you want to talk about wind and solar right? After all they are free supposedly? Well, not true, in fact, it is quite pricy, just to get the rare resources to make solar panels. But in inclusion to the solar panels and wind power, you'd need a reliable alternate. After all, the sun isn't shining all the time and the wind isn't blowing all the time. This is why despite the fact that Germany has invested so much in solar and wind energy, they have more coal plants then ever. And this in turn has caused some to go in to 'energy poverty' I hope this clears up why we can't elect a president with no experience just because of climate change.  Now, I'd like to talk about the flaws in Jills other plans. She would like to raise taxes on the rich. Of course this sound like a great plan, after all, virtually everyone (including me) thinks the rich should pay their fair share. But the top 10% already pay 70% of government funding. And not only that, but research shows that the laffer curve for the rich indicated that the revenue collected from them INCREACES then taxes on them are DECREASED. Weird right? Well it turns out that when the rich know that less of their money is going to govt, they are far more willing to spend it. This also often indicates that they are putting money into their business, meaning they are probably hiring more people. And luckily for me Gary Johnsons tax plan will allow this to happen.  And again, Jills environmental plan was tried in Germany, and as I said, failed.  Her minimun wage of $15 will put far to may people out of work.  Thanks for the debate and I look forward to the response.</t>

<t>'1. I heard they don't let just anyone become Pope.' You're right. The Holy Father must be holy and very wise. But keep in mind he's the head of a Church, not a Climate Committee.  ' I do see his opinion as having more weight than the average person.' On spiritual matters, yes; he's the Pope. On climate change, not so much. He might have an edge, but he's no expert. He IS a chemist tho.  '2. I disagree, it shows I am determined to defeat as many climate change deniers as possible.' I'm a climate change agnostic. I don't think pumping carbon dioxide can be good, but I seriously wonder if humans really can change the weather. I think we're overestimating our influence.  '3. ???' I know.  '4. That's because of ozone destroying products like hairspray being phased out.' Science is all about controls and variables. While it's true products like hairspray came around when the ozone hole began to shrink, other natural events were going on that could have been the cause. In a sense, if we look back on this as an experiment to find out what hairspray products do, we know our experiement would be tainted by other natural events, (climate involves the whole Earth) given that it has more than one variable  Lastly I'm a dude.

<t>Addressing the first prong of my argument concerning the leftward lean of journalists generally and the St. Petersburg/Tampa Bay Times specifically, Conservative Democrat wrote:  '(T)his doesn't prove that PoliticFact [sic] is biased unless we have other evidence as well.'  The debate challenge does not ask for proof. The debate challenge asks whether PolitiFact has a liberal bias. The bias among journalists and at PolitiFact's parent newspaper offer reasonable grounds for thinking PolitiFact leans left. The first prong is not meant as proof, for the debate challenge does not require proof.  It's a bit late to amend the rules of the debate, such as they are.  Addressing my second prong, regarding PolitiFact's failure to provide a principled distinction between its 'False' and 'Pants on Fire' ratings, Conservative Democrat wrote:  'No, they did state why they give some claims False and some Pants on Fire. (...) For example; False claim: I am leading over my opponent in Poll A - But you were not leading; Pants on Fire: I am leading in every poll - But your opponent actually is beating you in many polls.'  Where I inserted the ellipsis, Conservative Democrat simply repeated the description of the ratings like one I had already supplied. The remainder of Conservative Democrat's answer offers example as a substitute for principle. But why is a string of wrong statements not merely wrong but in addition 'ridiculous'? PolitiFact never states any such difference in terms of principle. When pressed on the matter during a 2014 podcast interview, PolitiFact editor Angie Drobnic Holan said '(T)he line between 'False' and 'Pants on Fire' is just, you know, sometimes we decide one way and sometimes decide the other' (1). Her statement does not provide any principled distinction between one rating and the other.  Providing an example in rebuttal without identifying the principle in the example counts as a failed rebuttal.  Again addressing the second prong, this time in terms of the PolitiFact's tendency to more likely grade Republican false statements 'Pants on Fire' than those of Democrats, Conservative Democrat wrote (accounting for the next few sections of quoted text):  'Regardless of whether the rating is subjective or not, there is still a reason for this.'  If the reasons follow no objective principle then the ratings are effectively subjective and the disparity in the ratings shows PolitiFact's liberal bias.  'Republicans are generally more religious then liberals, so many don't believe in evolution.'  PolitiFact rarely rates claims touching the issue of evolution. If Conservative Democrat can offer as much as one example of such rated 'Pants on Fire' then the point would be at least slightly interesting. But even then it does not turn my third prong.  'Many also don't believe in Global Warming.'  Conservative Democrat might have cited that factoid to PolitiFact. Unfortunately, the example plays to my advantage in this debate. PolitiFact does not bring scientific rigor to its ratings on global warming, and in fact sometimes reverses its rating principles on the topic. PolitiFact uses a 'burden of proof' standard in its statement of principles. If politician does not support a claim and PolitiFact cannot support it with evidence, PolitiFact calls the claim false (2). Yet a Democrat can say 'It is true that there's virtually no Republican who accepts the science that virtually is unanimous' and PolitiFact gives it a 'Mostly True' rating despite the fact that most Republicans have offered no statement of their beliefs on climate change (3). PolitiFact will sometimes simply trash its own principles in favor of a popular public narrative. When a Republican does not offer a position on climate change, does it follow that the Republican does not accept the science? Is that logical? When a fact-checker abandons its principles to favor one side of a debate, it's a solid sign of bias.  '(M)ore Republicans will get fact checked, so more of them will make 'Pants on Fire' statements.'  The research takes that into account. It does not look merely at which party receives more 'Pants on Fire' ratings but instead at which party's false statements are more likely to receive 'Pants on Fire' statements. If the proportions were equal, Republicans could have 20 times more 'Pants on Fire' statements but the research would show no evidence of bias by that measure. Conservative Democrat misstates the nature of the evidence.  'Liberals are generally more intelligent then conservatives'  What's the relevance, other than affording the opportunity to use a citation? If it's not relevant, it's not an intelligent move to include that factoid.  'So why would the apparently liberal PoliticFact [sic] allow PoliticFact [sic] Wisconsin to not be liberally biased? What is more likely is that the claims Wisconsin Democrats make are more likely to be false then the Republican statements.'  How would PolitiFact National stop PolitiFact Wisconsin from favoring Republicans in its selections of 'Pants on Fire' statements? There's no use asking why if there's no how. The notion that Wisconsin Democrats are more likely to make false statements lacks any evidence in support (using PolitiFact statistics would beg the question), and more importantly Conservative Democrat should note that both 'False' and 'Pants on Fire' ratings supposedly indicate false statements. It doesn't solve the mystery to say that Wisconsin Democrats more likely make more false claims. That's irrelevant to a disparity in the chances of the application of the 'Pants on Fire' rating.  Turning attention to the third prong of my argument, Conservative Democrat wrote:  'First off, PoliticFact didn't use, 'The wrong denominator nine times.' Your source says they miscalculated 9 times.'  There's no discrepancy. Using the wrong denominator results in a miscalculation of percentage error (4). My source says as much, but in different words ('It is incorrect to divide by the incorrect estimate, 175 lbs' (5)). The thing you divide by is the denominator.  'If this site was liberally biased, why even allow the republicans any bonuses?'  That was explained. Wrong procedures by poor fact checkers are more likely to favor the fact-checker's ideology. 'More likely' does not mean 'exclusively.' Lack of bias would mean no pattern of one party receiving more unfair harm than the other. Any other understanding represents a straw man.  'we don't get any links to the miscalcuations [sic].  The source links to a spreadsheet that identifies every case in question.  'There were 6 calculation errors (apparently) that helped Democrats. This means they have a .9% chance of making an error in favor of a Democrat.'  That statement shows a lack of understanding of the research. The search strand provided a suitably random sample of PolitiFact's work looking for one type of calculation. A sample looking for special cases. Your conclusion doesn't follow at all.  'Look at the democratic chart on this website. That hardly looks like they are helping democrats much.'  That's unresponsive to the point. We have no baseline from which to judge the fairness of the charts. Your opinion is only evidence of your opinion. Maybe the Democrats made more false claims.  Conservative Democrat dealt briefly with my fourth prong:  'A) You didn't show how this is a liberal bias.'  Did. 'If PolitiFact National's worst work favors Democrats over Republicans, then it serves as an evidence of PolitiFact National's liberal bias.'  'B) You are focusing on an unrelated part of this fact check.'  Biased fact-checkers are more likely to commit and sustain a blunder that agrees with their bias. How is that not related?  'C) This is out of context.'  Based on what evidence? How can rising costs ever reduce a deficit in any context?  'Government spending stimulates the economy.'  The only way that could lead to deficit reduction is when taxes are collected on the increased economic activity (revenue, just like I said). But you don't get back more than you spend, do you?  'D) Again, what does this mean? You didn't explain how this proves a liberal bias.'  Do I need to repeat myself? PolitiFact's apparent incompetence favored the liberal position. I don't need proof. I just need reasonable evidence, as I've already explained.  As this stage of the debate shows, Conservative Democrat has failed to refute any prong of my argument. PolitiFact's institutional bias probabilistically shows a liberal bias, two research projects show strong evidence of PolitiFact's liberal bias, and Conservative Democrat has no counter to my anecdotes.  Conservative Democrat summarized: 'So of these 4, you failed to back up 2 of them, one of these 'biases' is out of context, and the other one is nitpicking.'  I've explained why each of your criticisms ring hollow.  'It is not my job to prove PoliticFact [sic] is not biased, when no evidence to the contrary exists.'  I said that if you do not refute each prong of my argument then you need your own affirmative evidence. That's perfectly true, despite your (straw man) hint that I improperly shift the burden of proof. You haven't refuted any part of my argument (evidence in my reply above), nor have you provided your own affirmative case. Based on our arguments, it is reasonable to conclude that PolitiFact has a liberal bias. All of the evidence is on my side.</t>

<t>Seeing as this is the final round, I will refute and then end with closing arguments.1) 'First off: 'according to my sources Arctic ice had increased from 2010, which is contrary to the expectations of global warming experts.'Sorry, was a typing error, I meant it increased from 2012. The link is http://www.conserve-energy-future.com......As I've shown before, the author of the article doesn't give any sort of conclusion. He gives 5 reasons why it's true, and 5 reasons why it's not. Not only that, but for his '50% more arctic ice' point, he doesn't give us any sources! This is ElmerB all over again!2) The global sea levels rose about 6.7 inches in the last century. The source is http://www.conserve-energy-future.com...... and if the rate of rising sea level remains same, it won't be having much effect. Also, it may promote development of underwater cities as they would have to do it for survival.But that's the problem, the sea levels are rising faster than they used to be! Instead of 6.7 inches in a year, the article I've linked indicates it will rise far more than 6.7 inches (1). Con also states, 'It may promote development of underwater cities as they would have to do it for survival.' I thought we were going to try and solve global warming, not run away from it.3) We must find a viable replacement of fossil fuels rather than targeting the removal of co2. If production of co2 continues at this level, what will be the use of reducing it through plants and stuff when we can directly attack the source? It is just like instead of plugging a leak in a ship, we take a bucket and keep throwing the water away. First we must tackle the leak, then we can clean up the ship.I have an analogy for you. Let's say your sink is leaky. You find where it is leaking, and you see a hole in a pipe. Instead of just ordering a replacement part, you need to find a way deal with the leak before the replacement part arrives! Analogies aside, who says we can't do both? I've already stated my plan (fertilizing the sea in order to create algal blooms). The U.S. Government is working on converting algae into a bio fuel with success (2). In other words, we can solve the global warming problem, and then harvest the algae once the pollutants are absorbed out of the atmosphere. 4) Yes, but the point I want to make is that fossil fuels are a finite resource and must be saved for later generations, or we will run out of it sooner or later. The predictions may or may not be accurate, but we all know that production of fossil fuel is not possible. We have to drill under the Earth to find their reserves. If there is a way to make sure energy production continues, we must take more concrete steps towards finding new sources of energy.We are (see above). But these steps are not economically or environmentally feasible yet, and the CO2 we produce is still an issue (3). Also, why do you think we should 'save some fossil fuels for later generations?' I thought you wanted to develop different alternatives to fossil fuels altogether.5) 'I've already shown how global warming is a reality, and you accept that'Just for this debate. Otherwise it will become a separate debate, and we will divert from the crux of the debate.Strange, because in every round thus far (including this one), you have linked 'evidence for why global warming isn't true.' I don't think you're telling the truth to the judges here. Examples:'Has co2 really increased that much, or is there another reason? And are the readings of 1900's even correct? Weather science is still flawed and developments are still occurring, how can we rely that readings of previous unadvanced centuries were correct and that this century is really colder than before? Diversion (Round 3, Con)-''Also, some of these links believe global warming may not be true (Round 1, Con)-''Some more links (or people) that are against global warming (Round 2, Con)-''according to my sources Arctic ice had increased from 2010, which is contrary to the expectations of global warming experts (Round 2, Con).'5) That being said, 7 billion humans breathe out carbon-dioxide everyday. Should we start killing people? No.6) But instead if we tackle the source, naturally even with the number of plants we have right now co2 will be gradually reduced and temperatures would recede to normal. 'Normal.' What temperature is normal? 7) Has co2 really increased that much, or is there another reason? And are the readings of 1900's even correct? Weather science is still flawed and developments are still occurring, how can we rely that readings of previous unadvanced centuries were correct and that this century is really colder than before? Diversion-Fallacious argument. 'There is no way to prove that the sources are correct, and therefore, global warming isn't true.' Fallacy of ignorance (they haven't dis/proven it, so it must be true/false).8) Fossil fuels have not been used properly until the industrial revolution, when machines required power that was generated from fossil fuels, and drills were made that could find new reservoirs of oil. 'Until Mad Max becomes a reality, no one will be killing each other over a gallon of gasoline or a watt of electricity.' Yet we know the unrest in the Middle East is because nations want to take control of the oil reservoirs. It is also because some Arabic countries believe Israel isn't entitled to the land they were given by the UN. It is also because of terrorist activity. It is also because of bad rulers, dictators. The article I've linked at the bottom talks about how it is not only oil that causes unrest in the Middle East (4).9) Worse still, fossil fuels can't be synthetically produced in lab, at least without wasting more resources than it is worth. Say if there was a way to utilize the energy of fossil fuel without burning it and causing pollution, how valuable and eco-friendly would fossil fuels become? And if a new energy source that would be renewable and cost efficient was invented, wouldn't people remark burning stuff for energy as archaic? We already have a solution to decrease co2, we must at the very least find a solution to meet the energy demands, should we not?See in my round 2 argument on algal blooms and how they a) solve the global warming problem, and b) can be converted into energy once carbon dioxide levels subside.Now, closing.Global warming is too big of a problem to ignore.We pollute this world. My opponent agrees. However, we disagree on how to solve it. Con would like you to believe that focusing on fossil fuels is all one has to do in order to combat global warming. This is far from the truth. We must first combat the emission, and then the source. We, the human race, are responsible for two million deaths a year due to our carelessness when it comes to air pollution (5). That's not even counting land and water pollution! We must combat the emissions, as they are simply to dangerous to let 'gradually reduce,' as is Con's plan. Instead, we must focus on absorbing these pollutants out of the atmosphere by encouraging growth of certain plants. See my Round 2 argument on algae being both a solution for global warming and a way to make clean energy for more information. I'm running out of word count.Thank you for this debate.

<t>I would like to thank beforeifall for presenting his argument. 1500-Year CyclesThe 1500-year cycles are not global. Most of the data that scientists have found on this has come from the northern hemisphere. However, in the southern hemisphere, the exact opposite trend happens. In other words, whenever the northern hemisphere is warming, the southern hemisphere is cooling, and vice versa. 'Whereas Antarctic and Greenland climate records do exhibit approximate anti-phase behavior around 50% of the time, they are generally in phase during cooling. A phase lead of Southern Hemisphere climate of 1000-1600 years is statistically indistinguishable from a lag of 400-800 years, whether for Dansgaard-Oeschger [1500-year cycles], Heinrich, or longer-duration events. The 'seesaw' or 'Southern lead' appearance of the data arises from the fundamentally different characeristics of the climate series, most importantly the absence of rapid warming events in Antarctica comparable to those in Greenland'.[1]However, in the current case, we see that both the northern and southern hemispheres are warming, meaning that it cannot be due to the 1500-year cycles.[2]Human Emissions of Carbon DioxideThe claim that CO2 levels were higher during certain ice ages is based off of old, faulty data. A recent study found that the levels during the Ordovician era (the era most climate skeptics focus on when making arguments like this) were eight times below pre-Industrial levels. This is indeed still a little high, but it's also important bearing in mind that the sun was dimmer then. During the Ordovician era, the sun was 4% dimmer. This meant that higher CO2 levels would have been necessary for Earth to have not been frozen over. This is based on established nuclear models of main sequence stars. Considering all of this, '...over the long term, there is indeed a correlation between CO2 and paleotemperature'.[3][4][5]Apparent Mismatch Between CO2 and Temperature IncreasesIt is true that the vast majority of the warming happened over the 20th century. However, it is also true that the vast majority of the CO2 emitted into the atmosphere was emitted over the 20th century. See the graph below[6]:It is easy to see that only a small fraction of the emitted CO2 was emitted before 1900, and this correlates with the fact that only a small fraction of the temperature increases occurred before 1900.Amount of CO2 EmissionsAny CO2 emitted into the atmosphere would have an adverse effect on the climate. As I said in the last round, there was a study that said, using a Bayesian statistical approach, the climate sensitivity as maximum 4 degrees C, a mean of 3 degrees C, and likely value of not lower than 3 degrees. This means that the CO2 that humans emit thus has an effect of 3 degrees C per doubling of CO2. This can be shown by the fact that CO2 concentrations have increased from around 275 ppm to around 400 ppm. This is an increase of around 40%. This should manifest itself with a temperature increase of a little less than 1.5 degrees C. This is indeed around the amount of global warming we have seen so far. It should not be more than this.[7][8]If less CO2 had been added into the atmosphere, then the planet would have warmed less, but it still would have warmed. This would be true for any non-zero amount of CO2 emission. Climate ModelsThis point is irrelevant. The climate is much more complicated than just a correlation between CO2 and temperature (even though it still exists). Climate models have to be extraordinarily complicated, and even so, they might leave out very important climate forcings. Even if they didn't, there might still be glitches in the models that would make the model give an invalid result. The ability for climate models to accurately predict the climate is completely independent of the whether or not CO2 levels are related to temperature levelsIt is worth falsifying the notion, however, that there has been no warming since 2000. This idea is based on satellite measurements of atmospheric temperature. However, there are two problems with this. One, while the atmosphere accounts for only less than 3% of increased heat content, the oceans account for the vast majority, and they show no such trend.[9] The graph below shows this[10]: And two, there have been a lot of negative short term forcings over the last 20 years. Removing the short term trends of the extremely powerful El Nino in 1998, volcanic activity, and solar activity, the atmospheric temperature plot looks more smooth[11]:(You can faintly see what the plot looked like before the negative forcings were removed; the variability after 1998 makes any analysis before a statistical reanalysis suspect).Correlation Between CO2 Emissions and CO2 LevelsMany studies have shown that the 'airborne fraction', or the fraction of human CO2 emissions that stay in the atmopshere, is around 43%. The fact that the CO2 levels flatlined during WWII is actually rather complicated. While military activity spiked, other industrial activity plummeted and millions of people died, decreasing the need for non-military CO2 emission even lower. In addition, CO2 levels are not known with the precision necessary to unravel this mystery before 1960, due to improper measuring techniques. There are simply too many factors too consider to make a sound conclusion here.As for the apparent 800-year lag in CO2 levels after temperature increases, this is indeed true. However, this is because there was no non-natural (i.e. human) forcing of CO2. Instead, another forcing initiates the warming trend, and CO2 amplifies it. 'When the Earth comes out of an ice age, the warming is not initiated by CO2 but by changes in the Earth's orbit. The warming causes the oceans to release CO2. The CO2 amplifies the warming and mixes through the atmosphere, spreading warming throughout the planet. So CO2 causes warming and rising temperature causes CO2 rise. Overall, about 90% of the global warming occurs after the CO2 increase.'[12]Human Versus Natural CO2 EmissionNatural CO2 emissions are typically stable, meaning that there is rarely any long term climate change that results from natural emissions of CO2. However, humans have emitted a lot of CO2, above and beyond what is naturally emitted, and this unbalances the climate stability. 'Although our output of 29 gigatons of CO2 is tiny compared to the 750 gigatons moving through the carbon cycle each year, it adds up because the land and ocean cannot absorb all of the extra CO2. About 40% of this additional CO2 is absorbed. The rest remains in the atmosphere.'[13]Solar ActivityThe most important of the natural climate forcings is indeed the sun. It is the source of the Earth's energy. This energy comes from the radiation emitted as a result of fusion reactions at the core of the sun. This radiation is known as the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI). Any change in the TSI causes energy imbalances on the Earth. This energy imbalance can be calculated using the formula below[14]:Delta means change, so Delta(F) means the change in energy (i.e. energy imbalance) and Delta(TSI) means the change in solar irradiance. The 0.7 factor comes from the fact that the Earth reflects about 30% of the solar radiation it receives, and the 1/4 factor comes from spherical geometry.Changes in temperature are proportional to the energy imbalance. This can be expressed in the formula below[14]:Lambda is the constant of proportionality, representing the climate sensitivity (discussed in my first argument) in this case.The only thing that's left is to actually determine the values. First, the change in TSI (in this case, between 1900 and 1950). '...we'll estimate the change in TSI at 0.5 to 2 W-m-2.' This corresponds to an energy imbalance of around 0.1-0.35 W-m-2. Next, the lambda factor. I explained in the last article that the statistically most probable value for the climate sensitivity was around 3 degrees C. But, there was a lot of variation. 'Studies have given a possible range of values of 2 to 4.5°C warming for a doubling of CO2, which corresponds to a range of 0.54 to 1.2°C/(W-m-2) for λ.' This gives range of values from 0.05 to 0.4 degrees C, with a most probable value of 0.15 degrees C (corresponding to the statistically most likely climate sensitivity). In other words, solar activity from 1900 to 1950 raised the temperature of the Earth 0.15 degrees C. Looking at the effect of CO2 emissions over that same period, humans increased the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere by about 20 parts per million, giving a range of values of 0.14-0.32 degrees C for the effect of that emission on the climate, with the most probable being 0.22 degrees C.[14][15]This corresponds to CO2 amounting for 60% of the warming from 1900-1950. After that, it gets higher. CO2 emissions rise exponentally, and changes in the TSI start getting less positive, and eventually become negative after 1975. 'Over the past century, this increase in TSI is responsible for about 15-20% of global warming. But since TSI hasn't increased in at least the past 32 years (and more like 60 years, based on reconstructions), the Sun is not directly responsible for the warming over that period.' Solar activity cannot account for the warming after 1975, and even before that was a smaller factor than CO2.[14][15]This can be shown in the image below[16]:Therefore, we see CO2 correlates with recent temperature increases better than solar activity, especially after 1975.Long Term Forcings and MarsThe cycle of radiation is so long that it would not be having the sudden, enormous effect we've seen over the last 150 years. As for Mars, the studies concluded that it was a change in the surface dust, not solar activity, that caused the warming. Surface dust has a massive effect on Mars's climate. The supposed warming trend went from before the surface dust change to after it. Therefore, Mars did not warm because of solar activity.[17][18]SourcesSources in comments.</t>

<t>Thank you for the chance to debate this topic. I am an avid believer that climate change is mainly man made, at least now.  Your first point was how even though data shows a correlation between CO2 emissions and temperature, carbon emission is not the largest factor. But according to the World Meteorological Organization (as well as NASA and countless organizations and scientists), CO2 is the largest factor of global warming. This study included natural substances like water vapor. The problem with CO2 is that it is a very abundant greenhouse gas which takes a long time to dissipate from the atmosphere. 65% of global emissions are CO2 emissions, making it by far the most abundant man made greenhouse gas. Even though it isn't as abundant as water vapor, it is much more effective at trapping the Sun's rays. Now, greenhouse gases are the largest cause of global warming, while the most effective and very abundant greenhouse gas is CO2. Here are some graphs:  From NASA, this is probably the most infamous graph as it shows just how drastic CO2 emissions have gone up.  (It won't let me post photos, so here is the link) http://climate.nasa.gov...  Enlightening, isn't it?  Now this concerns temperature rise at the same time as CO2 rise.  http://climate.nasa.gov...  This link should have the graph close to the top on the right hand side Not only that, but a massive 97% of all scientists agree global warming is man made. ------- Your second point was that temperatures were higher in the past than they are now (specifically, during the time of Roman civilization). While there definitely are natural cycles that rise and lower, Earth's temperature is accelerating at a much faster rate than any natural cycle before, and shows no sign of stopping like a cycle would. This is again, because of man made emissions, and the majority of those are carbon. ------- Your third point was that global warming is mainly due to sun rays hitting the earth and heating it up. While sun rays hit the earth and that is what causes all weather, the amount of rays stays basically stable like the earths orbit. So when greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere, they trap sun rays and warm the earth.  So the evidence shows clearly that global warming is mainly people driven, although natural cycles may contribute to the increase. The evidence shows clearly that greenhouse gases are the largest cause of global warming. The evidence shows clearly that CO2 is the largest greenhouse gas threat. Therefore, the evidence shows that CO2 is the main cause of global warming. </t>

<t>I understand the argument.  First, 2050 is a projection given by Bill Gates for zero emissions throughout the whole world IF serious and drastic changes are made in reducing of C02 levels. It's not that they wouldn't take effect until 2050 but rather that humans have to work very hard to reach that point by 2050. I did not mean to attack that specific part of the argument but I just wanted to make that clear.  Now, with that being said, this ties into my argument which is that global warming is a greater issue than poverty.  That is, global warming is effecting us now, as I have said before. Drastic changes are already being made right now in order to make an attempt at reaching that goal of Zero C02 emissions by 2050. So, I must make it clear that climate change is a problem that is effecting all humans, right her and now.  Some current effects of climate change are... -Increased coastal flooding and sea level rise. -More damaging wildfires. -More severe droughts. -More severe deforestation. -More severe health risks to humans by pollution. ...Just to name a few http://www.ucsusa.org... -This website run by the Union of Concerned Scientists evaluates the situation properly.  So, as far as the immediacy of this issue I would argue that is is more so than poverty because it effects everyone one on Earth and mostly because it takes LONGER to fix.  Poverty is an immediate issue currently effecting many people but climate change is also immediate and will take much longer to resolve.  Finally, I would also like to state that the solutions for climate change coincide with the solutions for poverty. Just as an example, the Tesla Power Wall allows consumers to store energy that is collected by solar panels, and use it anytime they want. This will prove to be extremely useful for underdeveloped areas which are not anywhere near a power grid.  In reference to that statement, I argue that solving the climate change issue first would be more beneficial to the human race than attempting the vice-versa option which you are arguing. While I agree that educating people will lead to the reduction of global climate change, I think that by the time every underdeveloped country catches up in education, it will be too late for the earth.  With that, I do believe that global climate change is a greater issue than poverty, and that focusing attention on that would be better for the human race.</t>

<t>Pro has ventured away from his original resolution that technology is making humans graceless by bringing up issues like global warming and climate change. These are red herrings, so I will therefore not address them. [1] Overpopulation: To be brief, overpopulation isn’t necessarily even an issue. It’s essentially a myth being perpetuated by the ignorant. [2] Social Media: “These things possesses a danger of sharing any sensitive information in a blink of eyes  .“ -Pro Pro is referring to the potential of sensitive information being shared on social media. The issue with this is that users on social media have the choice to post as they please. It is their own fault and responsibility if their information is leaked, not the fault of technology. The cases of unwanted events being shared in the form of cyberbullying are so limited that it has virtually no effect on the human race in total. Pro fails to address that essentially ~75% of human beings don’t even use social media (not including bots or sockpuppets that have social media accounts, which I didn’t mention previously). [see previous figures in R1] Deadly Weapons amp; The Atomic Bomb: Whether or not the creation of deadly weapons and the usage of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki are bad is both questionable and subjective. Not fact, as Pro claims in their conclusion. War: Simply put, war is perpetuated by human beings, not by technology. The complete removal of technology would not end war. If technology never even existed, war would still go on. That is human nature.Pro’s arguments are flawed and my primary points remain virtually unrefuted. Pro’s conclusion states that his points are facts when in reality, most of them are extremely subjective and nothing more than opinions. Pro also used a strawman logical fallacy in the end of their conclusion in an effort to make some points I brought up earlier seem notably more ridiculous and unimportant.

<t>I think green spaces are more important than expansion of cities for economic progress. I can give many reasons..... Economic benefits- Houses close to parks are on average 8% more expensive than similar properties further away. Greener cities attract more visitors, whose spending on shopping and leisure generates job opportunities. Health benefits-People who use green spaces are more likely to take exercise than those who don't, and that the attractiveness or quality of green space is important: people don't want to use neglected parks or open spaces. The more time people spend outdoors the less stressed they feel ' an important consideration given the cost to the UK economy of depression and mental illness, which has been calculated at '26.1bn. Social benefits-Academic studies tend to support the relationship between well maintained local green spaces and people's feeling of belonging. People who live near green spaces are more likely to feel a sense of attachment. In Zurich, researchers found youths were more likely to meet and make friends with people from non-Swiss backgrounds in the city's parks. This all shows that green spaces are much more important than expansion of cities that do nothing but creating problems for our existence on Earth.</t>

<t>The word 'main' as used in the debate heading presents the position that humanity's contribution to global warming is greater in magnitude than any other factor. The definition of 'main' could be explained as: chief or principal in rank, importance, size, etc. Therefore, Pro must prove that the human portion is in fact the largest of factors. Of course, the human portion needn't be greater than 50% of the total effect if there are multiple elements/factors at play. I also agree that it is more than possible that human activities could affect, change or initiate natural processes, but again, that would have to be quantified (what portion of a natural system has been altered by human elements versus natural change). Natural and human effect can be intertwined and extremely complicated, if not impossible to differentiate and separate. This is referred to as the 'attribution of recent climate change'. I will reference the following scholarly article: https://gfdl.noaa.gov... 'Detection and Attribution of Recent Climate Change: A Status Report'. The authors make several important conclusions in this comprehensive study: 'Greenhouse warming alone is insufficient to explain the observed pattern of climate change.' and 'The most probable cause of the observed warming is a combination of internally and externally forced natural variability and anthropogenic sources (see also Tett et al. 1999). But given the large model uncertainties and limited data, a reliable weighting of the different factors contributing to the observed climate change cannot currently be given. In short, we cannot attribute, at this time, with a high level of statistical significance, the observed changes in global and large-scale regional climate to anthropogenic forcing alone.'. This research contradicts Pro's assertion that human causes are definitively more important than natural ones. In addition, to say that our current warming trend was caused solely by the industrial age based on the chart I presented (in round 3) would be to dismiss the fact that the sharp rebound from the Little Ice Age and commencement of our current warming trend (1600-) was initiated and occurred well before human activity was a relevant factor. I agree with much of the content contained within the two sites referenced by pro, but none of them contains information that establishes that human activity plays a greater role than natural variability. The CO2 now website asserts that 'The human impact on climate during this era greatly exceeds that due to known changes in natural processes, such as solar changes and volcanic eruptions.' and lists several of the unique contributions and circumstances associated with human activity and greenhouse gasses. It also states that 'the radiative forcing from human activities is much more important for current and future climate change than the estimated radiative forcing from changes in natural processes.' These are grand statements, but there is no attempt to quantify them unlike the formal research document I presented above (which contradicts these sites). There is also no mention on Pro's sites of the fact that our current warming period was initiated well before the industrial age and human influence by natural forces. Even the IPCC continues to protect its reputation by using vague terms such as '...likely' regarding the position of humanity's '...dominant role in global warming'. I acknowledge that we currently are experiencing global warming. For those who lived in 1100 BC and 1300 AD, they also experienced global warming on a larger scale than we do today, even though human activity had little correlation to that warming. Thus, to say that Global Warming is unique to the industrial age is false. It is also very likely that scientists will one day be able to prove/quantify what portion of Human Activity is attributable to global warming. Presently, it is not possible as my opponent acknowledges. This is why no scientist(s) or scientific body has declared a victory on this issue (A quantified attribution of recent climate change). In fact, a very large amount of money and large amount of research continues to be spent on this very issue because it has yet to be proved or resolved. I also agree that the current warming period presented on the on the chart I referenced is abrupt and is likely a reflection of the influence of human activity. Being that this warming period has yet to exceed several recent warming periods in effect and duration, we need more time in order to be able to place our current warming period into the context of other prior larger warming periods. It is simply premature to state definitively that human activity is the main factor in global warming. My statement is reflected in the current feverish rate of research being performed into the Attribution of Recent Climate Change. If a definitive conclusion had been reached, this research would not be needed to such a degree. Keep in mind, that I am not advocating that humanity should not take responsibility towards reducing our greenhouse gas emissions; quite the contrary.</t>

<t>Framework:Economic Globalization: “The trans-national increase in trade and capital transfers across national boundaries.” [http://tinyurl.com...] If I can prove economic globalization will have a net negative effect, I win. If my opponent proves the converse, he/she wins. Environmental Concerns:Generally, as income increases, so does production and consumption. These trends facilitate a rampant increase in pollution. Obviously, pollution isn’t something that is a net positive for society or for environment, as environment destruction has a subsequent negative effect on society. Pollution, as it is increased by economic globalization, creates an “Inverse-U” graph of environmental decay, called the Kuznets Curve. Environmental degradation is an irreversible cost of economic globalization, as demonstrated by the graph below:     [http://www.trunity.net...] Essentially, when economic globalization begins, the short-term effects on environment are empirically harmful. However, assuming economic globalization is successful in poverty reduction, the curve is completed and environmental degradation slows. Regardless, the initial impact on environment is irreversible and extremely harmful. For the preservation of the environment, it’s imperative we don’t utilize economic globalization as an international policy.This point is important, and I think it needs further explanation. It’s necessary to understand the effects of globalization are far-reaching, not confined to developed or developing countries. It applies to both of them, and that’s a basis for global environmental degradation. Though some proponent’s of economic globalization assert the Kuznet’s curve flattens its environmental effects, this does not include CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions. Increase in production and consumption and easily induce further CO2 emissions, which subsequently results in global warming. There is “No evidence that Kuznet’s curve for CO2 ever turns down on its own.” [1]Global warming is a subsequent effect of CO2 [2], and it’s generally common knowledge -- being backed by empirical studies [3] CO2 emissions are generally and primarily caused by increased production, which is what economic globalization facilitates. If it increases production, the only logical consequence is then furthered global warming.Besides CO2 emissions, SO2 (sulfur oxide) emissions, which are pollutants [5], are another facet of considerable concern in regards to economic globalization. Yong S. Cho of Korea University explained in a study that there exists “a negative long-run relationship between SO2 emissions and income for developed countries…” [4] This clearly isn’t a positive consequence as there is less income. Even with SO2 emissions regressing, the effect on developing countries outweighs this slight benefit. The study continues, “while trade liberalization appears to increase environmental quality in developed economies, it has a detrimental effect on environmental quality in most developing countries.” Essentially, slight reduction in SO2 emissions in developed countries has little effect when weighed against *increased* emissions in developing countries and long-term lower income in developed nations.Aside from these two specific negative impacts, the total impact is negative, as indicated by studies. The foundation of this conclusion rests on one main point: the “race-to-the-bottom” theory, which will be addressed in further contentions. Because of this, the environmental degradation facilitated by economic globalization is both highly detrimental and irreversible.Labor Implications:The “race-to-the-bottom” theory is essentially constructed of the idea that “to the extent that countries are open to international trade and investment, environmental standards will be lower than they would otherwise be.” [6] Competition is a primary factor of economics and the standards by which corporations and countries lead their policies and practices. When competition becomes international rather than limited to nation-wide, companies lower labor standards to compensate for increased competition. Lowered labor standards facilitate and directly alter labor practices in a regressive manner.  [http://cdn.static-economist.com...] The graph above exemplifies the impact of lower labor standards on practices, and demonstrates the regressive trend over a period of 17 years. The graph is derived from an empirical time-series investigation study conducted by Ronald B. Davies of UCD School of Economics. [7] The study typifies these concerns: economic globalization has a net negative impact on labor practices and econometric spatial lag between the labor-rights index and actual labor practices. Lower labor standards allows unethical labor and wage abuse to employees, which could potentially apply to every working individual. This is a huge problem in regards to generating a net benefit. The Economist summarizes the findings as such: “If the labour standards across all other countries decline, those of the excepted country also tend to fall.” [9] These demonstrate the negative effects of economic globalization, and affirm the “race-to-the-bottom” theory.Moreover, the same conclusion can be applied to regulations in environmental protection, indicating due to increased competition, regulations would be lowered to lure polluting businesses to contribute to their GDP. These large companies would settle in areas with the least environmental prevention to their company. The same study from Harvard [6] explains, “by limiting trade and investment in some way, we might be able to attain a better environment for any given level of GDP.” This would negatively affect the environment as these companies would be permitted to release vast amounts of emissions known to contribute to global warming and general degradation of the environment. But beyond environmental attributes, labor practices and the facilitation of income inequality. Osvaldo Sunkel, professor of economics in Chile explains, “Since the [19]80s, when the new [globalization] policies have been implemented more or less all over the world, income distribution has worsened, both within countries and among countries.” [8] Income distribution is being degraded by economic globalization since the 1980s, and no evidence seem to suggest that trend will skew in favor of economic globalization. Indeed, Marc Bacchetta, economics research and statistics division of the World Trade Organization, furthers that globalization results in an “economy [that] is characterized by less job security, lower incomes, an absence of access to a range of social benefits and fewer possibilities to participate in formal education and training programmes – in short, the absence of key ingredients of decent work opportunities.” [10] Opportunities for “most” individuals to obtain “good” jobs are lacking, labor standards are degrading, and income inequality is rampant; all of these necessitate refraining from economic globalization.Conclusion:Due to large concerns in regards to the environment and the implications on labor, economic globalization does not generate a net benefit and certainly is not appealing or desirable. </t>

<t>Rebuttals1. Isolation if we don't accept globalizationThis point is objectively false for a number of reasons:1. First of all, this is the black or white (false dilemma) fallacy. My opponent falsely asserts there is only two options: isolation, or accepting economic globalization. However, this is quite false, as there are other options, similar to the one for which I advocate.2. Per the definition, which my opponent did not attest or challenge (and thereby accepts), economic globalization is 'The trans-national increase in trade and capital transfers across national boundaries.' [1] Increase, as denoted, is the key word here. Not accepting economic globalization doesn't prohibit trade, it just doesn't advocate for the rampant increase. 3. Thusly, a country isn't by default isolated by nonacceptance of globalization. The claim that the countries would be much poorer is unfounded.2. More money flowHere's a few responses:1. While money can flow in an easy manner, that doesn't necessitate countries being richer. In fact, I've shown how labor implications render this point false.2. My evidence points to the fact that income distribution has worsened. Job opportunities have failed because of this (my evidence also supports this) and subsequent poverty is not solved.3. In the end the flow of money =/= to a richer population, as the money can become transparent for the common people.3. Economic globalization and bananasA couple of responses here, as well:1. Trading, again, doesn't require economic globalization. Before the term was even implicit of an increase in trading, trading existed.2. The rampant increase, as economic globalization would advocate, actually detriments the environment, as I've demonstrated. This would logically destroy the environment in which bananas grow. How can we justifiably advocate for something that would harm banana trade? The argument here is turned: environmental impact of globalization destroys the banana assertion.4. OutsourcingI have some responses of clarification and argumentation:1. What my opponent is claiming here is not just globalization, it's outsourcing. Yet, this doesn't justify globalization for a few reasons as I'll mention.2. Outsourcing is harmful. While it is acclaimed to be good for individual business, it has unintended consequences, a few of which include the following: '[it] leads to fragmentation and disintegration of the supply chain, inviting new competitors into the industry. It also nurtures corporate complacency; and it undermines a company’s relations with its labor, customers, and the domestic and local communities.' [2] These harms can lead it to being a bad business strategy as well as bad for the individual.3. Outsourcing lowers quality. CBS News notes 'Many firms that provide outsourcing quickly cut the quality of component parts in order to increase their margins.' [3] Desperation leads companies to cut down on quality to make more cash for their business itself.4. Outsourcing in regards to progress. Global research finds 'Beginning in 2002 the US began running trade deficits in advanced technology products with Asia, Mexico and Ireland. As these countries are not leaders in advanced technology, the deficits obviously stem from US offshore manufacturing. In effect, the US is giving away its technology, which is rapidly being captured, while US firms reduce themselves to a brand name with a sales force.' [4] Instead of helping the outsourcing nation, it erodes their dominance. Moreover, labor standards and practices in these outsourced companies is despicable. [5] It's not progress for poverty alleviation and human rights activism when a consequence of globalization degrades labor practices as well as the labor laws themselves.Conclusion:Environmental concerns coupled with labor concerns should be sufficient to negating the resolution. However, accompanied by falsehood's that lie in the affirmative (economic impact isn't there), there is no option but to negate.</t>

<t>I look forward to this debate.  First, I'd like to refer to the statement made by Phil Jones. This is not what he stated. His analysis is often misused to debunk climate change. The meaning of no statistically significant warning between 1995 and 2006 is not disclaiming weather warming. He's discussing the ability to detect a warming trend over a short period of time. Measuring climate over a short term has many variables; noisy factors. Hence, the resulting measurements do not have statistical significance. But extending measurements over a long term does have significance.  --'Over 31,000 scientists have signed on to a petition saying humans aren't causing global warming including 9,029 with a PHD''  I believe this is in reference to the Global Warning Petition Project. This endeavor has been deemed propaganda. Its originators were backed by Exxon. Need I say more?  Yes, recent measurements of the ice caps do indicate an increase. Yet again, one has to look at the variables. In part, the results are reflective on how the ice caps were measured. Measurement of ice cap thickness is relatively new. Also, the results are again based on a short period of time; a single year. Data collected since 1970 shows the ice caps have shrunk 40%.  --'Al Gore predicted all the Arctic ice would be gone by 2013''  Al Gore is not a scientist. He's a retired politician.

<t>John Kerry has been quoted as saying, 'And let there be no doubt in anybody's mind that the science is absolutely certain. . . 97 percent of climate scientists have confirmed that climate change is happening and that human activity is responsible. . . . . they agree that, if we continue to go down the same path that we are going down today, the world as we know it will change'and it will change dramatically for the worse.'  This is very false.  But leaving aside the catastrophic/'change dramatically for the worse' assertion which is not supported by any scientific agreement.  The most common source of this 97% number is in Cook et al. (2013) which leaves out the 'catastrophic' part. In Cook's summary of his paper: 'Cook et al. (2013) found that over 97 percent endorsed the view that the Earth is warming up and human emissions of greenhouse gases are the main cause.' ( main cause meaning over 50%)  97% of what? Of papers they surveyed. Not climate scientists.  However, if we were to say '97 percent of papers by climate scientists endorsed the view that the Earth is warming up and human emissions of greenhouse gases are the main cause' this too would also false.  This is not a debate on if global warming exists or doesn't exist. This is not a debate on if global warming is harmful to humans.  This is a debate on the 'Man Made' with the 97% claim. If it is not man made then it's usage is meaningless, and the claim should not be used. If there is not a 97% consensus, the the claim should not be used.  My argument is that 97% of scientists, or climate scientists, or climate papers DO NOT agree that 'man made global warming' exists, and anyone who claims this is misrepresenting facts, and that the 97% claim should be disregarded a false.  The Con side must prove that: 97% of scientists/climate scientists/climate papers agree that Warming is Man Made(51%).</t>

<t>Look at figure 5 in source 1. It clearly shows a massive spike in temperature right after the Little Ice Age. It would be easy to dismiss - except that, if you look closely, you see the temperature trending slightly DOWNWARDS before the Industrial Revolution started. Would we live in a much colder present without the Industrial Revolution's negative climatic effects? It's hard to deny the data, and it's even more of a stretch to say that there's no correlation with the IR.  As you said, carbon levels are rising. You attribute this to volcanoes. Yet volcanoes only produce about 1% of the carbon produced by fossil fuel burning (2). Even if the rate of volcanic eruptions quintupled, this would still not explain the dramatic rise in atmospheric carbon. You also state that climate change is part of some 'natural cycle.' Yet contrary to your beliefs (and, I'll admit, some of my idle thoughts, until I read this article), climate change is definitely not part of the same cycle as the Ice Ages (3). For one thing, it's not happening during the correct alignment of Earth's axis; while we're definitely in a warm period, the temperature should be FALLING, not rising, since the peak of the warm period was a few thousand years ago. Even if climate change WAS caused by the Sun, the troposphere is getting warmer while the stratosphere and -spheres above cool, a fingerprint of greenhouse gas warming. The Sun would be heating all layers equally. That leaves volcanic and oceanic greenhouse gas releases as the only possible candidates - yet they are both tiny climate change contributors, as I explained earlier, and - get this - they actually release a different carbon isotope mix with a different molecular makeup. The oceanic and volcanic carbon has a lower ratio of carbon-12 to carbon-13 - so how do you explain that the ratio has been rising steadily?  Lastly, you cited the Medieval Warm Period as evidence that the Earth goes through natural cycles of warming and cooling. Look at the map of the MWP warming pattern in source 4, and compare it to the map of today's manmade climate change. They look - ahem - a little bit different. The only part of the Earth that really saw significant warming during the MWP was Viking territory, and a larger part of the Earth actually got cooler. The lower map, of today's carbon, is like a goldfish that's been beaten to death - red with purple spots - and shows a much more uniform warming pattern.  Please explain.</t>

<t>Contention 1: CO2 and Temperatures. First, let's bring up just how much these accused compounds exactly warm the Earth's atmosphere. CO2 for example has the global warming potential of 1. Here are the other numbers. Carbon Dioxide -- 1Methane -- 21Nitrous Oxide -- 298-310CFC's -- VariousWater Vapor -- 0.25 [1]  Now, I just want you to keep this in mind for this next part here. We may observe that humans release approximately 35 gigatons of CO2 a year. [2] This is only 4.3% of the total amount of all Global Warming Gasses, however it is incrediably small when it comes to comparing the rest of the Global Warming gasses. If we observe the chart bellow we can see that Water Vapor is a large Contributor to Global Warming at 95% and CO2 comes in second. But here's the kicker. If we look at the Human contributed part that I'm about to post in the graph bellow we can see that it's very miniscule of 0.117% of all total Warming gasses. Now let's do some quick math here. CO2's increase was from what my opponent is claiming is from 295 ppm to 400ppm, a total of only 105 ppm. 1 Gigaton of CO2 is the equilivent of 2.13 ppm. [3] This means that increase of 105 ppm means a total of 49.29 gigatons. Since 1 gigaton of CO2 is the equivilance of .004% of the Greenhouse effect that means that 49.29 gigatons means an aditional .21% increase to Global Warming. This would account for a grand total of a 0.15 F increase in global temperature. This is a very measly amount and we can see that with my opponent's claims a simple 0.15 F increase isn't enough to melt glacers and have the effeccts that he is speaking of and it proves that this is NAUTRAL not man-made to fulfil his effects if they were real.     The above graph shows that comparisions of C13 (Carbon isotope) and this shows that there is little to no trend pertrade in many of these as the average is zero while the trend for all of these are zero. [4] This is important as the Carbon isotope is important in measuring this so called 'Global Warming.'   Let us observe the above graph. Here I would like to point out the that the increase from Pre-Inustrial to Industrial era and the doubling of the CO2 leveling lead to a decrease in it's temperature. Also we can see that the 10 mile 'hot-spot' above the tropics is actually absent. 'The computer models show that greenhouse warming will cause a hot-spot at an altitude between 8 and 12 km over the tropics between 30 N and 30 S. The temperature at this hot-spot is projected to increase at a rate of two to three times faster than at the surface. However, the Hadley Centre's real-world plot of radiosonde temperature observations shown below does not show the projected CO2 induced global warming hot-spot at all. The predicted hot-spot is entirely absent from the observational record. This shows that atmosphere warming theory programmed into climate models are wrong.' [5]Now if we observe the above graph of the past 400,000 yeasrs we can see that the CO2 rates in our atmosphere has flutated the exact same way in this cycle both before and during the existance of human beings. We can see that the temperatures and CO2 levels have been going up and down randomly for the past 100 thousands years and it is observed that this occured before the industrial revolution. We can also see that right now we are in a warming period so that arguing that humans are because of this is post hoc. Not to mention that we are in the coldest of the warming periods in Earth's history!We can see that once again despite contrary to belief we can see that though there may be warming the fact is simply that there is no human warming.  Contention 2: Earth is cooling.  If we observe the above graph we can see that Earth has been a whole lot hotter than where we currently are to the point where the Earth's average temperature has been 7.5 degrees Celcuis hotter than it currently it is. You can also see that in the span of the past 10,000 years the temperature has leveld off, but you may ask yourself where does that place us in the lights of modern day?  I am going to site Dr. Done Easterbrook, who is a climate scientist. Back in 2000 he predicted that Earth was entering a cooling phase. He predicts that for the next 20 years Earth will cool by 3/10 degree each year and that we are going to enter another little Ice Age like we did from 1650 and 1790. (6) The funny thing is that many of my opponent's charts are actually from the incorrect IPPC. How about the 'Hockey Stick' graph that many Global Warming supporters , including my opponent, argue about? Well if we observe the fallowing chart taken from Northern Scandenavia we can see that the Global trend over the past 1,000 years that the Global Cooling trend slope is that of -0.31 Degrees Celcuis, give or take 0.03 degrees (for the error room). Professor Dr. Jan Esper has found that the Earth's temperature of Earth actually decreases 0.3 per millenia due to the Earth moving away from the sun. (7)   Here is another graph from 1920 to 2005 and we can see that the graph has a negative temperature slope, thus meaning that the Earth is under a period of cooling. (8) You can see in terms of more Warming in the evidence in which Scientists use Ice Cores Earth has actually been Cooling the past Mellenium. You can see that in terms of Gasses contribution to the Green House Effect the major contributer is Water Vapor and it's at 95% to CO2's 3.6% and this is the overall contribution including man made and natural. When we look to the chart on the left we can see that Man-Made CO2 does have a higher contribution to the atmosphere than Water Vapor, but that's because we do not create much water vapor as humans. Even with this evidence we can see that CO2 does not have any effect what-so-ever compared to Water Vapor. (9) Where might those CFCs be on this graph you may ask. Why it's under the Misc. gases section. Once again, we can see that the IPCC and Al Gore are inccorect as the hocky stick graph is a bust. As I've shown in earlier rounds and they have been dropped in showing that the Earth's temperature has indeed been way hotter then current and on an average basis at that. My opponent has also dropped my opening graph in C1 r2 That also showed that CO2 levels are at an all time low! Thus once again disproving my opponent's theory.Here we can see that even though CO2 levels are increaseing that the temperature in recent years has actually decreased on the linear scale. Also, the US Senate Committe on Envirnment and public works also took a stab at this issue. They found that the Hocky Stick graph was also bogus in 2006. “Today’s NAS report reaffirms what I have been saying all along, that Mann's ‘hockey stick’ is broken,”Senator Inhofe said.“Today’s report refutes Mann's prior assertions that there was no Medieval Warm Period or Little Ice Age.” “This report shows that the planet warmed for about 200 years prior to the industrial age, when we were coming out of the depths of the Little Ice Age where harsh winters froze the Thames and caused untold deaths. “Trying to prove man-made global warming by comparing the well-known fact that today's temperatures are warmer than during the Little Ice Age is akin to comparing summer to winter to show a catastrophic temperature trend.” [10]Paleoclimate scientist Bob Carter had shown through his research at University of East Angila in the United Kingdom that the Climate Change increase had actually froze from 1998-2006 showing that this so called Global Warming had actually stopped. </t>

<t>I would like to thank my opponent for accepting this challenge.I'd like to remind the audience, and my opponent, before we get to far on the definition of Global Warming, and clarify any ambiguity. The round 1 definition should be sufficient, but to clarify Global Warming is the changes to the environment caused by manmade pollution. Pollution would be excess CO2, SO2, and so on. My opponent did not object, or provide an alternative definition in round 1 so I assume he accepts the definition.I will be presenting a controversial view that Global Warming has not accelerated the water cycle. This will have actual analysis of weather station data from NOAA. It is a large dataset, and I am willing to show anyone who asks how to begin analysing it. The Evaporation data is small enough to analyse in excel, but precipitation data would require a database or custom tools to work with. Analysis Method:In order to estimate precipitation, and evaporation levels I will be utilizing the NOAA GHCND weather station dataset. If you wish to download and verify the dataset can be found here: ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/1. To process this data the first step is to convert each stations monthly 31 day values into a single monthly median value for each station.2. Then each stations monthly median values are averages to create the average median for the life of the station.3. The station average median is then subtracted from the station median to create a delta that represents that stations change away from the average median.4. Stations are then selected based on the date of operation. For analysis starting in 1900 all weather stations that were operational in 1900 and operational at the end of the analysis must be used. Weather stations that were not operational at the start of the analysis cannot be used because they will induce an unknown bias that cannot be accounted for.5. From there the data can be graphed, or each months delta for the year can be averaged to create a yearly change for a simpler graph. 1900 to Present Precipitation:The Figure 1 below shows the change in precipitation from 1900 to 2015. As shown the precipitation for 1900 to 1930 stays consistently above the average median by about 1mm. The graph of SO2 emissions is there to demonstrate the correlation found in Global Dimming is present in this data. SO2 impedes precipitation by blocking the amount of light that reaches ocean organisms like Phytoplankton that create critical rain cloud compounds[1]. It also cutbacks on plant life by reducing light which also means less water in the air from plant transpiration which is what 90% of the water a plant gets is used for[5].As SO2 emissions were successfully cut back in 1990 there is a clear indication of an increase in precipitation. At most it increased to similar levels in the 40's and 50's up until around 2005. It is my burden to prove that the radical increase post 2005 in precipitation is clearly caused by factors not created by man.Figure 1: 1971 to Present Pan Evaporation Rate: Fortunately, NOAA's dataset does provide additional detail to see what may have changed in Figure 2. If evaporation increased due to additional heat it should appear in the Pan Evaporation rate. Regretfully there is an insufficient number of stations with pan evaporation rate data going back to 1900 so to increase the number of stations to a sufficient number for analysis the start date has been moved to 1971 allowing us to use 124 stations.Rather than show a gradual increase evaporation from gradual warming the pan evaporation stays constant from 1971 until about 2010-2011 where it then makes a radical change which correlates to the radical change in precipitation.Figure 2: 1980 to Present Precipitation and Evaporation:In order to get a better idea of what is happening the date range will need to be compressed further to allow the number of stations to be increased for further analysis. This way we will have 10,209 stations for precipitation, and 156 stations for evaporation for monthly analysis. We can see in Figure 3 better detail what a 20% decrease in SO2 pollution did to the precipitation rate. Unfortunately the increase in 2005, and later, was due to China, and India having increased SO2 pollution[7].Now we can see a mild increase in evaporation starting in 2005, and the shift in 2010 can be isolated to October 2010 using a box and whiskers analysis on the dataset to flag outliers.Figure 3: Solar Forcing of Evaporation:October 2010 is a very important time period. It marks a violent beginning of the Sun's solar cycle 24 approach to solar maximum as shown with NASA's October 18th 2010 image of the Sun ramping up for a Solar Flare[8]. Note in the Figure 4 October 2010 is not solar maximum, but the significant shift upwards in sunspot. By graphing the Sun's Sunspots it is possible to see if cycle 24 had an actual influence on the evaporation rate. Clearly the increase in evaporation has many of the same features as cycle 24 in Figure 4. However, none of the prior cycles appear to have any significant influence. However, in 2008 NASA announced that they had discovered the Earth's Electromagnetic Field was weakening[2]. This weakening most likely began before it was detected leading one to believe that higher than normal levels of light, and radiation began to leak in explaining the small increase during the previous solar minimum. As the field began weakening further evaporation accelerated. This also feed more plants, and phytoplankton allowing for more rapid development of rain clouds post 2005.Now that the Earth's field is weakening 10 times faster[3] than before explaining the continued increase even thow sunspots are on the decline. None of the increases above 1900 to 1930 norms can be attributed to any man made causes, and is entirely separate from any global warming claims. The accelerated water cycle is caused by the complex machinations of the Sun, and Earth's Magnetic Field.</t>

Now little about myself I'm a moderate Republican/independent living in a medium-size town of Joplin Missouri I'm here to change America to the right direction that we need or else we will never seen it again let's make America stronger.  Jobs/economy-I will start off talking about Jobs and the economy. Over 25 million people in America are unemployed because of this presidents failed policies what we need to do is Cut taxes on the middle class so businesses can stay open and others can start a business without worring about the high taxes they have to pay. As president I would do everything in my power to lower taxes to a reasonable point.  Environment-I support oil drilling because we really need the oil, but for nuclear plants we need to shut them down because there to much pollution in the air our oxygen is running out little by little and we need to stop it before it's to late climate change is growing rapidly the Midwest is getting crushed with rain and the west coast is suffering a severe drought so we need to stop this before it is to late.  Abortion- I believe that birth starts from concaseption I support abortion for rape and life endangerment of mother Otherwise abortion is murder even if you don't have money to take care of it ask a relative or put it up for adoption.  Gay Marriage- I support gay marriage all the way marriage is a bond between a couple and that means two people. You have the right to marry and love who you want and there should be respect for them. We have so many our issues to worry about then a persons love life you marry who they want they marry who they want.  Foreign policy- I believe we need to keep our relationships with other countries as good as possible. We need a border wall down by the Mexican boarder because illegals are coming in and taking our jobs we need to end this now  Thank you.</t>

<t>IntroductionWelcome. As debate over the Trans-Pacific Partnership heats up, questions about the benefits and drawbacks of free trade are being raised by people from all sides of the political spectrum.This debate will not be a defense of the TPP, as I do not know the full details of the bill. Instead, this debate will focus purely on the concept of free trade, and how it effects the US economy. I am an avid support of free trade, and I think it is extremely beneficial to both our country and the countries we trade with. Prerequisites To be eligibile to debate this, you must have a minimum of 3 debates voted on and an elo of 2000. Also, you must make sure that there are no things in your schedule that would potentially prevent you from completing every round. These are very lenient requirements intended to reduce the chance of forfeited rounds,Debate Structure The debate will have 4 rounds, a 72 hour window to respond per round, and a 10,000 character limit.The burden of proof is shared. Con is requried to show that free trade is a net harm to the country, and I am required to show that free trade is a net benefit to the country. Whoever best meets their burden of proof should be voted the winner of this debate.  The rounds will have the following structure:1st Round:-Pro: Introduction-Con: Acceptance2nd Round:-Pro: First Arguments-Con: First Arguments/Rebuttals 3rd Round:-Pro: Arguments/Rebuttals-Con: Arguments/Rebuttals4th Round:-Pro: Arguments/Rebuttals/Conclusion-Con: Arguments/Rebuttals/Conclusion If you're interested in doing this debate, please say so in the comments and I will let the most qualified person accept within a few days.</t>

<t>The trade regulations I advocate are targeted towards specific problems with unfettered free trade. I don't argue massive tariffs on every industry. To the extent that Pro's rebuttals attack wholesale protectionism, they simply miss their mark.SurvivalPro admits that we must drastically reduce carbon emissions to save our planet. Pro admits that we must do this now before it's too late. And Pro admits that global warming is an externality. Yet instead of *internalizing* global warming, Pro says we're better off leaving our survival to the chance that the market will reduce emissions on its own.Pro fails to realize that free trade is driven solely by prices, and if prices don't account for the harmful effects of carbon emissions, there's no incentive to reduce carbon emissions. In fact, the opposite happens: carbon emissions increase as a way to grab a cost advantage. Carbon emissions have increased every single year over the past 30 years as we've liberalized trade. We need to change that now. And the change can't be incremental. We need to lower emissions by at least 8-10%  per year to ensure our survival. [23] Free markets alone can't effect that kind of change.Pro dismisses my arguments because they lacked any sources. But not all arguments require sources. Mine doesn't. The argument I made is analytic, not empirical. But experience proves me right.Pro also cites two sources. They don't help.The first source 'estimates' that a 1% increase in sulfur dioxide output from free trade leads to a decrease in sulfur dioxide concentration of around .8%. The estimation is based on a limited theoretic framework and limited empirical data (since it doesn't look at actual free trade). It's also totally irrelevant because it dealt with sulfur dioxide. The source even notes that limitation explicitly: 'Free trade appears to lower sulfur dioxide concentrations for an average country in our sample, but may of course worsen the environment through other channels. Our evidence is specific to sulfur dioxide.' The issue in this debate is reducing carbon dioxide, not sulfur dioxide. Carbon emissions are an entirely different ballpark. The regulations that affect carbon are completely different than the regulations that affect sulfur emissions. Also, note that Pro's source actually finds an increase in pollution output. It's the increase in output that also leads to a decrease in concentration. This is very limited evidence compared to the huge number of studies showing harm to the environment from free trade: [18] [19] [20] [21] [22]  Pro's second source supports my argument, not Pro's. It states: 'Current actions are not enough if we are to stabilize greenhouse gases (GHGs) at any acceptable level. The economic challenges are complex and will require a long-term international collaboration to tackle them.' Acknowleding that 'no [trade] measures for climate change are in use anywhere in the world,' it finds that 'theoretical analysis points to a role for trade restrictions.' In fact, Pro completely distorts his source's findings. Pro fails to mention that we're talking about liberalizing trade in renewables while maintaining tariffs on fossil fuels. The study finds, just as I suggested in R2, that taxing carbon-intensive industries while liberalizing trade in renewables leads to increased use of renewables, which in turn leads to a reduction in emissions. This is precisely what I suggested would happen with a tariff targeted specifically at fossil fuels.  Pro argues that 'tariffs would lead to an inefficient allocation of resources due to the loss of comparative advantage.' But inefficiency is a better outcome than human extinction. And again, Pro's argument relies on the theory of 'comparative advantage,' which is wrong (see R2). Pro dropped that, or apparently deferred his response.Pro says 'losing efficiency means more waste and higher emissions from inefficient production.' This is untrue. First, Pro offers no evidence that 'inefficient allocation' leads to 'inefficient production.' On the contrary, as Pro's second source suggests, targeted tariffs and subsidies can increase efficient production and reduce emissions by encouraging efficient clean energy. Second, 'waste' refers to an economic loss, not to an environmental harm. Don't let Pro muddle this this issue: we're weighing potential economic growth against certain extinction of our species. Given our looming planetary ecological catastrophe, it's clear that environmental protections are necessary even at the cost of degrowth. Which isn't to say there's any degrowth; I'm just emphasizing the importance of collapse of reducing emissions.  SustainabilityPro argues that there's no link between free trade and our international investment position. But that is simply untrue. Free trade *allows* deficit trading, which is directly related to a country's international investment position. An international investment position is a statement of a country's foreign assets and debts. Free trade creates foreign debts via trade deficits.Pro completely drops my impacts. The results of deficit trading are disastrous for our economy. If there are any economic benefits to free trade, they're completely outweighed by the harms from deficit trading.Trade regulations can bring our trade closer into balance. Warren Buffet suggested one solution: give exporters $1 certificates for every dollar they export, and then require that importers buy a certificate for every dollar of goods they import. This would immediately bring our trade into balance.Pro broadly asserts that all trade regulations hurt the economy. But Pro offers no substantiation for this assertion. I've explained how trade deficits weaken our economy. Pro hasn't argued otherwise.Smoot-Hawley is irrelevant. I'm don't argue for Smoot-Hawley or anything even remotely similar. I support initiatives that bring our trade closer to balance, not drastic increases on tariffs for all industries. Pro's attack on Smoot-Hawley is a strawman and a red herring.InequalityPro admits that free trade increases inequality. Pro also drops all the impacts of inequality. Those impacts include more mental illness, drug abuse, obesity, teenage pregnancy, crime, violence, lower life expectancy, harm to trust and community life, harm to overall child well-being, and unsurprisingly, harm to the economy.Remarkably, Pro nonetheless asserts without any substantiation that economic growth from free trade outweighs all these social harms. I have two responses. First, the impact from an increase in GDP simply cannot outweigh these harms. Pro doesn't even tell us what the impact is. Growth has little if any positive impact. It simply means more wealth. It doesn't tell us who possesses that wealth. Nor does it tell us if more wealth is good for those people.What are they buying with that money? In the US, only a tiny proportion of production and human labor is devoted to actual human needs as opposed to market-generated wants. Over a trillion dollars is spent every year on marketing. More growth means more marketing, more market-generated wants, and more consumption of stuff we don't need. More growth doesn't mean more food, clothing, shelter, health care, education, or public transportation. More growth doesn't mean a cleaner environment. More growth doesn't mean less poverty or inequality. And most importantly, more growth doesn't mean more happiness. Research has found 'no trace of a relationship between income and happiness.' In fact, studies suggest that 'wealth may undermine people's ability to savor positive events.' [17] In other words, the rich may experience less happiness because awesome things like caviar and champagne become a regular experience instead of something to appreciate and savor. Accumulating wealth for its own sake might even be net harmful.Second, Pro fails to address my point that inequality slows economic growth. Pro hasn't offered a single reason to believe that growth from free trade outweighs degrowth from inequality. Pro's source, an article by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, offers no substantiation for its assertions. The article doesn't explain how free trade leads to job growth. It simply assert that free trade increases GDP based on an observed GDP increase. But there's no analysis as to what caused the GDP increase; it could have been any number of things besides free trade. And even if GDP increases, it doesn't mean the benefits pass onto most Americans. Most Americans work blue-collar jobs and are thus left unemployed by free trade. Then, they end up less happy because of greater inequality, and end up being at higher risk for mental illness, obesity, crime, and all the other impacts of inequality. To assert that an abstract quantifier like GDP outweighs all the harms from an increase in inequality simply misunderstands the nature of human well-being and happiness.RebuttalPro defers his defense of 'innovation and the gains of trade' until R4. This deprives me of a rebuttal in R3, which is both unfair and a violation of Pro's requirements in R1. With three days per round, Pro effectively gets nine days to write his defense while I only get three days to respond. Timing matters. Six extra days of research and polish increases the quality of one's arguments significantly. Pro gets an unfair structural advantage because of that. If Pro had no intention of addressing my rebuttal until R4, the debate should have been structured to limit rebuttals to R3 and R4. Instead, Pro required rebuttal in R2. Not addressing that rebuttal until R4 is abusive towards that requirement. Pro says he 'ran out of time.' But that's not an excuse. Everyone must balance time. R1 states: 'you must make sure that there are no things in your schedule that would potentially prevent you from completing every round.' Yet Pro couldn't complete his round because he 'ran out of time.' Punish him for that.Sources in the comments and reposted in R4.</t>

<t>Yooooooo my bro varrack accepted. and btw its not just a video game, it's f*cking fallout 4. us b1tces have been waiting for like 100 years for this game.1: Happiness amp; sh1t.Charity has been happin for tons of years. Charity has been widly ineffective in producing happiness in the third world. Hunger still exists, rape still exists, choclate salty candy balls are still not in the mouths of children. There are an limited amount of resources by definition charity can only help for a short time. They are prolonging the deaths of children. It is better to leave them alone and allow them develope or die on their own like evolution demands. Giving the monei to bethesda to develop fallout 4 more developlly will be better use of charity money. If you play video games it will cause very much happiness more than any child would get. These african  and cancer children wait for some aspect of hope where none will likely to be found but they can know FO4 already exists! Fallout 4 can release violant and sexual hangups that all gamers have with the violanet and sexual nature of the game. Food or cancer resarch only causes happiness for a few moments only to worry about more funding and sh1t. Fallout has so much replayability and if Bethesda releases new content each mounth the game can NEVER be completed. This will insure extreeme happiness forever.If you dont play video games, than you can learn or watch people play it on the jewtubes. It can also realse sexual hangups with vault girl cosplayshttp://i.imgur.com...; /gt;*Cough* exucuse me, I have to take a cold shower.Back. damn sexy right? With enough money going to PR tons of women that look like her will dress similar further leading to increased happiness and libedo of the male race. Ultilmatly causing more children to be born to make more FO4 content. Charity can do none of this2: culture amp; sh1tFFallout is a game bout war and necular war. seeing the world like this will cause fauture generations (caused by sexy vault girls (see above)) to not want war. They wont want to look at ugly ghouls or huge azz super mutants, they will cheresh the world today. This will cause climate change to be elimated, everyone will be too bsusy playing fallout to make any more global warming. and by teaching an apprechastion of the world will cause people to strive for an elimnation of climate change. With everyone playing fallout to get rid of sexual and violent hangups, there will therefore be no violence or rape. Unwanted pregniences will go down and wanted pregniacnies will go up. Drug addicts can cure their addiction by taking drugs on the video game relasing there urge to shoot up (or huff up jet).when mod tools are relased people will become smarter because they want to make mods to add beards, hair, beards, giant penises, and more weapons in the game. Theyll have to learn how to animate textures, and create texutres. creating a smart computer literate people who know their sh1t .This will create jobs for a megaton of people. Bethesda will have to hire millions of emploies to expand on the market. Everyone will already have qualifications3: World peaceWith everyone united by fallout 4, all the poor, sick, and hungery dead this will allow first world nations to expand and take over the countires that were home to the weak.This will create a better use for the land. Everone speaks the same laungage fallout 4 and this unites people into creating a one world government with world peace in mind. All first world nations have common ground a love of FO4 and wish to avoid what happened in fallout. Ambitions will be to help future generations, to expand our minds and fallout 4. Develope flying ships like the one in the fallout trailer to develope technology similar to fallout's and to finially achive space travel in case all else fails. With the future in mind men will finillay reach the stars and create a galatic empire.All thats required is to stop giving money tf*cking charites and start giving it to bethesda</t>

<t>I would like to thank Kryptic for accepting this debate.Correlation and CausationConsider the Cenozoic era (the last 65 million years). Overall, solar activity increased 0.4% over this period. 'Because Earth absorbs about 240 W/m^2 of solar energy, that brightness increase is a forcing of about 1 W/m^2. This small linear increase of forcing, by itself, would have caused a modest global warming through the Cenozoic Era.' The CO2 levels caused a much higher forcing. In contrast, atmospheric CO2 during the Cenozoic changed from at least 1000 ppm in the early Cenozoic to as small as 170 ppm during recent ice ages. The resulting climate forcing, as can be computed accurately for this CO2 range using formulae in Table 1 of Hansen et al. (2000), exceeds 10 W/m^2. It is clear that CO2 was the dominant climate forcing in the Cenozoic.'[1]In fact, the temperature changes correspond to the CO2 changes. '...there is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr.'[2]This graph shows the CO2-temperature correlation over the last 700,000 years: Excess CO2 traps heat. Considering the recent global warming, satellites measure less heat escaping out to space, at the particular wavelengths that CO2 absorbs heat, thus finding '...direct experimental evidence for a significant increase in the Earth's greenhouse effect.' In other words, the Earth is retaining more of the heat that it receives from the sun that it received from before. This excess heat manifests itself through global temperature increases.'If less heat is escaping to space, where is it going? Back to the Earth's surface. Surface measurements confirm this, observing more downward infrared radiation. A closer look at the downward radiation finds moreheat returning at CO2 wavelengths,leadin to the conclusion that '...this experimental data should effectively end the argument by skeptics that no experimental evidence exists for the connection between greenhouse gas increases in the atmosphere and global warming.''[3][4][5]Evidence of Mankind's Influence on the Recent Global Warming TrendIt would be rather coincidental if the recent rise in global warming happened to start just around the time that humans started to emit large quantities of greenhouse gases. However, there is direct evidence as well, in addition to the already established correlation between temperature and CO2.Now, it is known that CO2 levels are increasing. 'In pre-industrial times over the last 10,000 years, CO2 was relatively stable at around 275 to 285 parts per million. Over the last 250 years, atmospheric CO2 levels have increased by about 100 parts per million.' CO2 levels are increasing at a level not seen in at least 500,000 years, if not longer.[6]Here is a graph showing CO2 concentrations over the last 10000 years: [7][8]Now, carbon has several isotopes, three of which are C12, C13, and C14. C14 is radioactive, and has a half life of around 5,730 years. The CO2 emissions that humans make come from fossil fuels. Thus, if humans were the cause of the excess CO2, we'd except the C14/C12 ratio to decline, because, while there is a relatively constant amount of C14 in the atmosphere due to continuous replenishment (when a neutron collides with a regular nitrogen atom, a C14 atom and a proton result), the amount of C14 in the Earth has steadily decreased because it is not replenished, and since fossil fuels come from the ground, almost pure C12 is being ejected into the atmosphere. Indeed, it is observed that the C14/C12 ratio has declined. And thus, if humans were the cause of the excess CO2, we'd except the C13/C12 ratio to decline, because plants find it easier to take in carbon dioxide with a C12 atom than one with a C13 atom, implying that plants have a lower C13/C12 ratio than the atmopshere and, since animals eat plants (either by directly eating then or eating something that eats plants), also implying that fossils also have a lower C13/C12 ratio than the atmopshere, implying that we'd see a decline in the C13/C12 ratio as well. Indeed it is also observed that the C13/C12 ratio has declined.[9][10][11]This can be observed in the graph below (this is the C13/C12 ratio over the last 650 years; the C14/C12 ratio graph was too big to put in the debate):The evidence that this excess CO2 is the cause of the recent global warming is voluminous. One piece of evidence is a comparison of warming in the troposphere and stratosphere. Because the CO2 is in the upper troposphere, the troposphere temperature would increase, while the stratospheric temperature would decrease, because there would be less heat reaching the stratosphere. 'Computer model estimates of the ‘human influence’ fingerprint are broadly similar to the observed pattern. In sharp contrast, model simulations of internal and total natural variability cannot produce the same sustained, large-scale warming of the troposphere and cooling of the stratosphere.'[4][12][13]This graph shows this: [4]Another piece of evidence is the frequency of cold days and nights. Because the sun only shines in the day time, is the sun was causing global warming, the days would warm faster than the nights, while if greenhouse gases were causing global warming, this wouldn't be observed. It is the latter's prediction that is observed. 'What we observe is a decrease in cold nights greater than the decrease in cold days, and an increase in warm nights greater than the increase in warm days.'[4][14]This can be shown in the below graph: [4]Overall, the evidence shows that human-emitted greenhouse gases are the cause of global warming. CO2, in addition to other gases like methane and nitrous oxide are being emitted by humans in very large amounts, and this is manifesting itself in an increase in the average global temperature.Climate Sensitivity and FeedbacksClimate sensitivity is the amount the temperature would rise if the CO2 concentration were doubled. Obviously, if there's a large climate sensitivity, then increases in CO2 have large effect. It is known that the climate sensitivity is around 1 degree C. However, this can be amplified through feedbacks. Positive ones amplify the sensitivity, while negative ones diminish the sensitivity. The evidence overwhelmingly comes down on the former, that positive feedbacks are happening. Increases in CO2 cause temperature increases, which are amplified by water vapor and the effect on clouds.'Since the radiative effects associated with the buildup of water vapor to near-saturation levels and the subsequent condensation into clouds are far stronger than the equilibrium level of radiative forcing by the non-condensing GHGs, this results in large local fluctuations in temperature about the global equilibrium value.'[15]This can be shown in the below graph: Further, increases in CO2 affect the carbon cycle in this way:Global warming can result in the death of vegetation (due to droughts) and the warming of the ocean. Both of these further reduce the maximum absorption of the Earths carbon cycle, thus resulting in even more CO2 being released into the atmosphere. And with this, CO2 increases even more. In other words, CO2-caused temperature increases are amplified by positive feedbacks and the mechanics of the carbon cycle.So, the positive feedback amplifies the climate sensitivity. How much it is amplified can be determined through study. Using a Bayesian statistical approach, which is “the dominant [method] in the literature”, these findings support the notion of climate sensitivity as maximum 4 degrees C, a mean of 3 degrees C, and likely not lower than 3 degrees.[16]The graph below gives a statistical analysis:[17]The mean is around 3 degrees C. The CO2 that humans emit thus has an effect of 3 degrees C per doubling of CO2. This can be shown by the fact that CO2 concentrations have increased from around 275 ppm to around 400 ppm. This is an increase of around 40%. This should manifest itself with a temperature increase of a little less than 1.5 degrees C. Indeed, temperatures have increased around this amount over the last 150 years. The anthropogenic-forcing climate models thus match observations.[18]In other words, in addition to the direct evidence of how the Earth is warming, the climate models based on a greenhouse gas cause to global warming explain almost perfectly the recent global warming. This is a lot of evidence for a human case to the recent global warming.ConclusionGreenhouse gases cause global warming because of their heat trapping abilities. Humans have been emitting vast amounts of greenhouse gases over the last 150 years, and this shows itself on the CO2 measurements. The atmospheric warming pattern and greater heating at night are evidence that the recent global warming is caused by those human emitted greenhouse gases. These increases are amplified through the water vapor and cloud positive feedbacks and the positive feedback that arises through the climate cycle. The climate sensitivity ends up being around 3 degrees C. Finally, the CO2-temperature record shows that the two correlate with remarkable correlation.SourcesSources in comments.</t>

<t>Alleged Rule Violations: 5. No trolling  How hurtful! trolling:make a deliberately offensive or provocative online posting with the aim of upsetting someone or eliciting an angry response from them. (Google) I am not trying to offend anyone deliberately. If anything, you are offending me by accusing me of breaking rules.  6. No 'kritiks' of the topic (i.e. arguments that challenge an assumption in the resolution)  The resolution is not about global warming, which was defined first round by 16k. The debate right now is about climate change, which since it has been undefined, I define as 'a long-term change in the earth's climate, especially a change due to an increase in the average atmospheric temperature:' (dictionary.com). I assumed we were talking about climate change as the resolution stated so. Even though he claims 'gt;R1 established 'global warming' (synonomous to 'climate change' in the literature) ', climate change and global warming are completely different, the Little Ice age was an example of climate change but not global warming. Not all change = warming. 16k thinks climate change = global warming because global warming is an example of climate change and they are therefore the same. That would be like saying because all squares= rectangles are rectangles = squares.  7. No semantics; debaters will adhere to the common/average understanding of the topic  The common understanding of climate change is changes in the climate, not necessarily warming. The definition of origin is 'the point or place where something begins, arises, or is derived. (google)', which basically means beginning of something, which means the start. The start of CLIMATE CHANGE dated back to millions of years ago.  'Con's debate strategy is immoral, unfair, and rule breaking. '  To what morality system? Back up your assertions. Unfair? Well you instigated it and made the resolution so, not I. I am adhering to the rules. I explained why I followed the rules.  Conclusion  Climate change (not the same thing as global warming) has been happening for millions of years before humanity was alive.

<t>First off, THANK YOU! I am very excited to have this debate, and I hope it goes well.This debate assumes that climate change has happened over the past centuries, and that over that period of time there has been a overall increase in global temperatures. So yes, I think. Before we start I would like to present these following facts/opinion that I humbly ask my opponent and voters to count as truth in this debate. As of now, current levels of CO2 are around 400 parts per million, give or take a little. Another is that most scientists who believe in Antropogenic Warming think that global temperatures will increase by 2-4 degrees C by the end of the century. Finally, most of said Anthropogenic Global Warming is caused by release of CO2 according to most scientists who believe in this form of warming. Make any changes or additions to this list as you see fit, also while some of these are opinions I ask that in this debate we consider them truths. If you disagree please make it be known in you speech, and provide counter 'truths.' Lets Begin! Arguments that Contradict and Disprove the Idea of Anthropogenic Global Warming 18 Year Equalibrium: In this argument we will examine the fact that there has been no warming for 18 years and 4 months. (actually 6, but site is one month old)  From December 1996-March 2015 there has been no global warming as shown in the average. This really is shocking in the grand scheme of things because this proves that despite the world blasting carbon into the air, there has been no change in average temperature. This completely contradicts what Pro-antropogenic Global Warming scientists believe, meaning that they have prodicted it all incorrectly. 30000 Scientists: In this argument we look at the MASSIVE number of scientists that oppose the idea of Anthropogenic Global Warming. A petition has been cycling has aquired 31,487 scientists who reject the idea of Antropogenic Global Warming, 9,029 of those individuals have a PHD. An argument of the oppisate side is that there is a concensus amongst scientists that Global Warming is caused, but these numbers clearly destroy this notion. When we have this many scientists, especially those with PHDs, who say that global warming is not caused by human activities and any 'evidence' that says otherwise is false, you must assume that something simply is not correct with the opposing arguments. Antarctic/Arctic Ice: In this argument we will examine the fact that Antarctic Ice has hit all time records and the fact that Arctic Ice rebounded by 50% from 2012-2013.   Antarctic Ice hit its all time record in 2014, surpassing the 20 million square millimeter mark. The antarctic ice has been increasing by about 18,900 square kilometers since recording first began. Increase in this ice has been occuring for several years, and in the past few years have been making new records while Arctic Ice on the other hand has been struggling. I frankly will be the first to admit it, however I will LOUDLY proclaim the fact that it has been making comebacks. From 2012 to 2013 Arctic ice rebounded by 50%. This means that despite this 'global warming,' ice continued to increase. So basically during this time period, both the arctic and antarctic ice increased, despit increased CO2 which should have caused an increase in temperature. Even though Arctic Ice had been shrinking, the fact that it increased speaks volumes to what is really happening.   Ice Age: In this argument we will examine an ice age that occured whis CO2 levels were signifigantly higher than they are today. s://stevengoddard.files.wordpress.com...; alt='' width='640' height='404' /gt;  (this graph shows the Atmoshperic Carbon Levels and Average Global Temperatures from around 600 million years ago till today) As this graph clearly depicts that at around the 450 million year mark Earth went into a HUGE ice age. However during this time CO2 Levels were at a little more than 4000 ppm. 4000! This means that Earth was experiencing and ice age while the CO2 levels were more than 10 times what they are today. Now the fact is: if what some scientists are saying is true, and CO2 has the power to raise the temperature of the planet by 2-4 degrees by the end of century, then this simply should not have happend. The is conclusion is this: CO2 does not have an impact on global temperatures because there have been cases in past where huge opposites have occured that simply should not have happened according to opposing scientists.  Flawed Arguments of the Opposing Side  97% Consensus: This argument examines the often sited 97% consesus of scientists that believe global warming is real and is caused by human activities and is dangerous.  This study was run by one person and a couple friends who supposably read over 10,000 papers, and said that 97% endorsed the idea that global warming is human caused, and dangerous. However, a professor and 3 coauthors went back through and looked at these papers and saw that this was simply not the case. In fact, they found that only 0.3% of these papers supported the idea. Therefore we can conclude that the 97% consensus is false. The reason you believe the professor is because he is a professor. The other individual was a blogger, who to the extent of my knowledge did not have these types of credentials and could not have made better conclusions than the proffesor.   Weather:  In this argument we examine how arguments about weather are completely unjustified.  Tornados are at an all time low. These past three years have seen signifigantly less tornadic events than any other year since monitoring in the 1950s. Major hurricanes have been at or bellow average for the past 50 years, whereas the before years before that had substantially more with only one year that was below average.    The above graph shows that droughts have been very stable over the past few years, despite the idea that the Earth should heating up. In fact there has been no signifigant changes with number of droughts or their severity, so any argumnet that droughts are increasing is just false. The opposing argument often points bad weather and says 'Ha! Here! We told you this would happen!.' But the fact is, bad weather happens, and we should not assume the globe is warming just because some bad weather happens here and there.     Climate Models: This argument looks at the climate models that the pro-Anthropogenic Climate Scientists.   A former NASA scientist has examined the climate models and found that of those he examined, 95% of thes overcasted actual warming for years, meaning that they have been wrong time and time agian about what the global temperature SHOULD have been. I will tie this into another point, and that is that almost all predictions made by pro-Anthropogenic Global Warming scientists have been WRONG! By now the ice caps should be MELTED! Polar bears should be drowning! However as shown above this was simply proven to be completely false.   Hockeystick Graph: This argument examines the often sited 'Hockeystick Graph.'   No specific site for this one, I just know about it. So the problem with the graph is that it is a cherrypicked portion of global temperatures on Earth, and if we looked at centuries prior we would see similar, if not higher Temperature Levels without added CO2 by humans. So basically it is more of a scare tactic than actual proof of Anthropogenic Global Warming.     THANK YOU so much for debating me, and I appologize if I did everything wrong, but this is part of the reason I am doing this so if you could just give me some tips and corrections I would be most appreciative. Also, the 'truths' at the top probabaly should have been stated at the beginning, so I appologize for that.</t>

<t>I thank my friend for this debate and I am sorry for the mix-up. Now to post arguments:  How did global warming discussions end up hinging on what's happening with polar bears, unverifiable predictions of what will happen in a hundred years, and whether people are 'climate deniers' or 'global warming cultists?' If this is a scientific topic, why aren't we spending more time discussing the science involved? Why aren't we talking about the evidence and the actual data involved? Why aren't we looking at the predictions that were made and seeing if they match up to the results? If this is such an open and shut case, why are so many people who care about science skeptical? Many Americans have long since thought that the best scientific evidence available suggested that man wasn't causing any sort of global warming. However, now, we can go even further and suggest that the planet isn't warming at all.  1) There hasn't been any global warming since 1997: If nothing changes in the next year, we're going to have kids who graduate from high school who will have never seen any 'global warming' during their lifetimes. That's right; the temperature of the planet has essentially been flat for 17 years. This isn't a controversial assertion either. Even the former Director of the Climate Research Unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia, Phil Jones, admits that it's true. Since the planet was cooling from 1940-1975 and the upswing in temperature afterward only lasted 22 years, a 17 year pause is a big deal. It also begs an obvious question: How can we be experiencing global warming if there's no actual 'global warming?'  2) There is no scientific consensus that global warming is occurring and caused by man: Questions are not decided by 'consensus.' In fact, many scientific theories that were once widely believed to be true were made irrelevant by new evidence. Just to name one of many, many examples, in the early seventies, scientists believed global cooling was occurring. However, once the planet started to warm up, they changed their minds. Yet, the primary 'scientific' argument for global warming is that there is a 'scientific consensus' that it's occurring. Setting aside the fact that's not a scientific argument, even if that ever was true (and it really wasn't), it's certainly not true anymore. Over 31,000 scientists have signed on to a petition saying humans aren't causing global warming. More than 1000 scientists signed on to another report saying there is no global warming at all. There are tens of thousands of well-educated, mainstream scientists who do not agree that global warming is occurring at all and people who share their opinion are taking a position grounded in science.  3) Arctic ice is up 50% since 2012: The loss of Arctic ice has been a big talking point for people who believe global warming is occurring. Some people have even predicted that all of the Arctic ice would melt by now because of global warming. Yet, Arctic ice is up 50% since 2012. How much Arctic ice really matters is an open question since the very limited evidence we have suggests that a few decades ago, there was less ice than there is today, but the same people who thought the drop in ice was noteworthy should at least agree that the increase is important as well.  4) Climate models showing global warming have been wrong over and over: These future projections of what global warming will do to the planet have been based on climate models. Essentially, scientists make assumptions about how much of an impact different factors will have; they guess how much of a change there will be and then they project changes over time. Unfortunately, almost all of these models showing huge temperature gains have turned out to be wrong.  Former NASA scientist Dr. Roy Spencer says that climate models used by government agencies to create policies 'have failed miserably.' Spencer analyzed 90 climate models against surface temperature and satellite temperature data, and found that more than 95 percent of the models 'have over-forecast the warming trend since 1979, whether we use their own surface temperature dataset (HadCRUT4), or our satellite dataset of lower tropospheric temperatures (UAH).' There's an old saying in programming that goes, 'Garbage in, garbage out.' In other words, if the assumptions and data you put into the models are faulty, then the results will be worthless. If the climate models that show a dire impact because of global warming aren't reliable -- and they're not -- then the long term projections they make are meaningless.  5) Predictions about the impact of global warming have already been proven wrong: The debate over global warming has been going on long enough that we've had time to see whether some of the predictions people made about it have panned out in the real world. For example, Al Gore predicted all the Arctic ice would be gone by 2013. In 2005, the Independent ran an article saying that the Artic had entered a death spiral.  Scientists fear that the Arctic has now entered an irreversible phase of warming which will accelerate the loss of the polar sea ice that has helped to keep the climate stable for thousands of years....The greatest fear is that the Arctic has reached a 'tipping point' beyond which nothing can reverse the continual loss of sea ice and with it the massive land glaciers of Greenland, which will raise sea levels dramatically. Of course, the highway is still there. Meanwhile, Arctic ice is up 50% since 2012. James Hansen of NASA fame predicted that the West Side Highway in New York would be under water by now because of global warming.  If the climate models and the predictions about global warming aren't even close to being correct, wouldn't it be more scientific to reject hasty action based on faulty data so that we can further study the issue and find out what's really going on?

<t>You first made the point about how I implied carbon dioxide is placed in the atmosphere by humans. You then procede to cherry pick a quote of mine without placing it into context. My point on that post is simply listing a possible alternate theory to climate change. You then refute my evidence and my link.I failed to provide you with the actual hieght of the jar that is my fault, but the equation you have provided is faulty, the equation says the amount of co2 humans emmision, you neglected my actual point of the cows in your equation.This organization,  http://timeforchange.org... that 1 kilogram of meat is responsible for the amount of carbon in the atmosphere as a car driving 250 kilometers. http://www.fao.org..., this website reports that livestock is a bigger threat than humans in contributing to climate change.Also the same webiste, skeptical science, states that natural causes like oceans and vegitation are 750 giggatons while out output is 29giggatonsLet me use your equation  ( (The amount of CO2 emitted by humans in 2010 in tons) * (Number of kilograms in a ton) / (Density of CO2 in kg/m^3) ) / ( (Area of Rhode Island in square miles) * (Number of square meters in a square mile) ) = Height of jar in metersLets switch it up witht the amount of greenhouses gases emmited by nature in tons. ( (The amount of greenhouse gases emitted by nature in 2010 in tons) * (Number of kilograms in a ton) / (Density of CO2 in kg/m^3) ) / ( (Area of Rhode Island in square miles) * (Number of square meters in a square mile) ) = Height of jar in meters,The same webiste foa.org says that cows where responable for 250 million tons so lets do a equation,(29,000,000,000,000* 907.185/ 1.98) / (1212* 2589988)  = 2338635.750884500000 meters or 2,338 miles compared to the 4 mile high jar humans emit. nature greenhouse gases gt; humansLook at this the same website you are using to 'disprove me' is also disproving you!!! http://www.skepticalscience.com... that unlike what you said albedo clouds are changing and that there are emmiting more than 2x the greenhouse gases humans are emmitingYou wanted citation for the gravitational magnetic oscillations, here it is: A book from Cornelius van Huten https://books.google.com...You claim that the sun is on a cooling trend : https://www.skepticalscience.com...this link says other wise, they claim that the Earth has natural cycles of warming and cooling and that is backed up by the natural cycles of the magnetic field and the sun.Then you once again deny something I said as faulty well let me back that up too, http://io9.com...You then say that 'if you believe that Co2 emmitions are causing something else to cause global warming, it means that you believe in man-made global warming.' I have just proved with evidence,something you failed to provide, and using the links that you provided me that nature emmits more than 35x the amount of greenhouse gases that humans emmit.</t>

<t>A significant tip of the hat to Con for their respect and generosity. Nice to know that religious debates still have the capacity to end on a professional note. Let's do it again sometime (preferably when I'm not under a thousand deadlines)! As all the following points are directed specifically at Christianity, I will approach my rebuttals from that perspective as far as my character limit will allow (which is less than I would like, sadly). First of all, religion is not as simple as we'd all like it to be, and as such, it needs to be handled carefully. It's safe to say that people who have spent their entire lives studying the biblical texts, thousands of years of exegesis, theology, and hermeneutics, and careful examination of the bible's original culture, heritage, treatment, languages, and context are going to know a lot more about how Christianity should be practiced than the average soccer mom or politician. Just like an actual medical scientist with a degree and ten years of university education is going to know a lot more about vaccines than a talk show host. It's the church's job to communicate its truths just like it's the medical community's job to communicate its truths (although there will invariably be dissent in both camps on certain issues, and one cannot guarantee that the masses will listen). If the church has failed in this commission, that's hardly the fault of Christianity itself, which actually condemns failure to properly instruct. Credit where credit is due. Con asks the question of what makes someone an extremist. My definition of an extremist is someone who takes an idea farther than it was meant to go, and subsequently causes harm. This can apply to religion, politics, civil rights... any opinion one has passion for, which is why we must be careful not to appeal to our emotions before we have considered our reasoning.  “from my personal experience, religion never does what it claims (makes people kinder or more moral).”  From my personal experience, religion never fails to do so. To each their own?  “The idea that the Old Testament is somehow 'null and void' because of the 'new covenant' is not biblically supportable (in fact, Jesus is quoted as saying that he comes not to change the [Mosaic] law) and will offend a significant number of Christians; are they extremists?” There are a few problems with Con's statement. Firstly, I never actually said that the Old Testament is null and void in Christianity. I said that the old covenant is. They are not the same thing. Secondly, what Jesus says in Matthew 5 is “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.” The word “change” does not appear in any translation I've been able to find, so saying Jesus is “quoted” as saying it is a bit of an exaggeration. Christ's sacrifice fulfilled the law and established a new covenant with all people. This covenant was built on the foundations of the old one, which is why many of the moral precepts in the Old Testament (the ten commandments, for instance) are still applicable, but the laws concerning what is clean and unclean, or laws discussing the judicial punishments for sin in the nation of Israel, etc., are not. My original point still stands. Any Christians who believe that the entire Mosaic law still applies to them have hugely misunderstood their theology (and seeing how few of them are willing to actually follow the 900+ laws contained therein, I'd say we have a hypocrisy problem as well). 'I know this: families are literally torn apart because a son is gay; that sentence needs correction: families are literally torn apart because they are religious; homosexuality is not a choice, religion is.' I am unaware of a single passage of Scripture that endorses the appalling treatment of homosexuals that the church has engaged in. I am, however, aware of thousands that condemn it. “I've met people on this site who literally stand for bringing back stoning-to-death because the bible prescribes it... are they extremists? Does their existence or, more properly, do their beliefs not demonstrate the responsibility that religion has for making the World a worse place?” I've seen atheists who believe that the only problem with Communism is that it didn't kill enough believers. I've seen atheists use Charles Darwin to promote and excuse eugenics, murder, rape, and racism. I've seen atheists who claim that anyone who subscribes to religious belief should be thrown into psychological institutions and tortured until they're “cured.” Is the world improved by their existence or beliefs? In my previous argument, I addressed that the bloodiest democidal regimes of the 20th century were almost exclusively spearheaded by atheists, despite the fact that, from a global perspective, atheists are an incredibly small demographic. Is that not reason to be concerned? Furthermore, if a Christian promotes slavery because of Deuteronomy, I can show him Galatians 3:28, which proclaims that there is no slave and free, Jew and Gentile, male and female, because we are all equal under Christ. However, if an atheist promotes slavery because of naturalism and survival of the fittest (after all, Slave-Making Ants do precisely what their name implies, why shouldn't we?), I have nothing to offer him but pseudo-philosophy and an ethics lecture which he would be well within his rights to dismiss as insufficient evidence. Is that enough reason to condemn non-belief as dangerous? “James Inhofe is potentially the most powerful man on Earth in terms of setting policy regarding man-made climate change, limiting carbon emissions, limiting agricultral chemical run-off, pollution, etc... and he says that there's no such thing as man-made climate change and he seems to think that Bronze Age texts (specifically the book of Genesis) prove that fact. What's worse is that he uses Romans 1:25 to peddle the idea that any climate campaigners are essentially working for the devil by worshipping false gods (worshipping the creation not the creator).” Strange, that, seeing as the very book of Genesis names Man as the steward of Earth, and discusses his responsibility in its subsequent corruption after the Fall. The bible also discusses how creation declares the glory of God. What reason could we possibly have to want for its destruction? Someone who cannot be bothered to read anything more than what they personally find useful is a hypocrite, and someone who thinks that the bible has anything significant to say on a topic as isolated to modern science as climate change (or GMOs, for that matter) is someone I won't hesitate to accuse of using religion as a cover for their personal biases. However, once again, we cannot necessarily blame religion for its idiots. “The Catholic church [peddles] the idea that condoms are universally wicked; the result of this is absolutely, specifically and directly that innocent men women and children suffer horribly and die because of the unnecessary spread of AIDS in Africa [2]. I blame religion for this effect; are you with me?” This is actually nowhere near as cut-and-dried as people think it is. Abstinence, fewer sexual partners, and monogamy are doing more to halt the AIDS crisis than condoms [1] [2]. Strangely, all three of those sound suspiciously like Christian teachings. 'in reality, murder rates are not obviously negatively correlated (quite the opposite) with religiosity.' Con has not addressed my rebuttals on this point. Finally, I actually would stand to disagree with Con that group selection accounts for morality and renders religion unnecessary in that regard. Group selection is a logical concept, but not a realistic one. After all, while a tribe that shares its food equally among its members will be stronger than a tribe that does not, tribal members that exploit the altruism of their fellows and hoard whatever food they can grab will be much stronger and better off than those they are exploiting, and will therefore be better candidates for natural selection. Even positing social consequence (i.e., they choose not to steal food for fear of a punishment from the tribe) falls flat because it requires there to already be a moral understanding in place (i.e., stealing food is wrong, and deserves to be punished). Morality of the kind that humans currently possess is not realistic through an evolutionary lens, because the “selfish gene” cannot (and has no reason to) act in the best interests of the group, only the individual. Even kin selection only explains altruism within one's genetic group. As far as this debate goes, here's what I acknowledge:    1. beliefs, more often than not, lead to actions.    2. if those beliefs are harmful, the actions will be harmful.    3. if religions preach things that are harmful, and people believe and act on them, it's safe to say that religion does not improve the state of the world.    But I also believe this:   1. religion teaches many things that are good, just, merciful, kind, and selfless.   2. religion is not to blame for people who misuse it or misunderstand it.   3. atheism/secularism has just as much capacity to cause evil as religion.   In conclusion, this debate has not seen me at my best. I feel it is only right to admit defeat, as I agree entirely that I have not provided sufficient evidence that religion, as a whole, makes the world a better place. I do believe that Christianity, at least, is a force for good, and I believe I can (and have) made that point to one degree or another, but as far as the topic at hand, I acknowledge my lack of a strong case. I thank Con for an insightful discussion, and hope the voters will bestow their points on the deserving winner.</t>

<t>Thanks Pro for the opening arguments.Preface: - It should be noted that Pro’s Resolution is specific about eradicating poverty, not just reducing it. - Beside the utter lack of sources amp; support for his arguments, Pro has yet to argue for the eradication of poverty, as affirmed in his resolution. Case: I. Causes of Poverty: - Poverty, like ignorance amp; corruption, is a human condition entrenched in all societies past amp; present for it stems from causes that are inherent in the human psyche amp; rooted in the environment we live in. For brevity purposes we will limit the said causes to some of the more relevant ones: 1. Corruption: factor that makes it easy for the wealthy amp; authority to get richer at the expense of the poor, for there is a lock of higher authority to check the flow of wealth amp; thus the rules turn in favour of the fittest at the expense of the weakest [1]. Even Humanitarian Aid from rich countries (such as the US) to poor countries (such as sub-Saharan Africa) is damaged by corruption [2]. 2. Climate Change: a condition generally beyond human control: some areas have stable climate suitable for cultivating land, harvest amp; nurturing livestock, some others suffer from extreme unstable environments, heat, soil, rain. . . that disrupts the sustenance necessary for local populations, which in its turn creates amp; may even perpetuate Poverty.    3. Wars: a state of affairs that drains resources, human amp; economic, amp; destroys the socioeconomic structures that generate amp; distribute wealth, which also creates Poverty amp; prevent possible solution from being implemented to solve it. amp; wars are, too, a human condition existing as long as humans exist. 4. Natural Disasters: floods, volcanos, tsunamis, epidemics, earthquakes. . . all contribute in destroying both wealth amp; the structure that might preserve it. Cause that can not be eradicated, not by any human means. II. Reduction of Poverty vs Eradication of Poverty: - Pro’s contentions are almost all for the reduction of poverty, not for its eradication. Pro must provide a way through which the roots of Poverty can be eliminated for good, that if he wishes to support his resolution. - Furthermore, even in case a particular society was seemingly successful in eliminating poverty with itself, that would not imply its automatic success in eradicating it. That is because such achievements are contingent to a very specific circumstances of time amp; place amp; overall socioeconomic situation unlikely, even impossible, to form a perpetual state.  Rebuttals: - The only argument provided by Pro seemingly supporting his resolution, that is eradicating Poverty as opposed to suppressing it, is the following: “The argument that we have not ended poverty yet is not an argument that it can't ever be done.”  - I certainly do not agree, for the above statement is inductively false. If, so far, we haven’t been able to end Poverty, then, inductively, that’s a good reason to believe that we never will. Believing there is a chance to end Poverty for good warrants, at the very least, as good a counter-argument as the above pure inductive argument is. An anology could be made with the following example: 1. So far the sun rises from the east. 2. The sun tomorrow will rise from the east. 3. The sun tomorrow will rise from the west. =gt; (1) is a fact ; (2) is inductively true, i.e certain. =gt; (3) is inductively false. Therefore, believing (3) to be true necessitate a serious argument strong enough to trump pure inductive reasoning! Hence my position.  Conclusion:  As I established throughout my round, eradicating Poverty isn’t simply rationally unjustified, for the statement “Poverty can be eradicated in the future” is inductively false, it is also amp; more importantly utterly hopeless, for Poverty is rooted in inunshakeable physical amp; mental realities, both internal amp; external, outside human influence.</t>

<t>Hey guys ,I will be glad if you read my essay and give me tips how ti improve it .Thankx in advance  Prompt : Is the world changing for the better  The world is changing all the time.Some people think it changes for the better ,while otherr think it worsens.In my opinion , the world around us is becoming better and better.I believe that we should always try to ameliorate our 'own world' ,making the whole world a better place.The subsequent examples from history and literature assert my point of view that our world is always changing and it changes for the better . In 14th century,in Italy began the era of the Renaissance.The new thinking and new ideas superseded the belief that God had created the world and he was everything we should have strived for ,our paragon of virtue.In 1356 a yound woman accidentally discovered male and a famale body in the wood.She was very astute and quite interested in biology and realized thath men and women had the same number of ribs.According to The Bible ,God takes one rib away from women and gives it to men ,in order to make them more powerful than women.Later,this woman became the first person to contravene the mores and ideas of the church ,becoming the first doctor in the world.The Renaissance absolutely changed the view that God was omnipotent and that we were under his authority.This era gave the world writers like Dante and Bocacco ,artists and scientists like Leonardo da Vinci .These people decided to controvert the church and change the world.They made it better !  'The dreamers' is a novel , written by one of the most famous African writers Walter Uanda.The novel is about two brothers who dream of becoming politicians and changing the communistic regime of their country.Inspired by true events,the author recounts how the young boy is killed during a 'peaceful' demonstration by the national army ; twenty years later ,his brother becomes tha first democratic president of the country.The champions the poor and influences smany African countries to stand against communism.He changed the African world for the better .  The world does not change in a constant rate.We choose how to change it ,and it depends on us if it will be changing for the better or for the worse.Since it`s inception ,the Earth has been evolving , and it keeps evolving at the moment ; we all hope it evolves for the better .  http://talk.collegeconfidential.com...</t>

<t>Now, back onto the debate.____________________________________________________________________________________Thank you, lannan13, for that impressive response. Unfortunately, he has broken the rules by refuting my graphs and data I had put out in round 2:'Round 2: Opening arguments and Constructive Case, NO REBUTTALS' I'm not sure if I should let it slide since this seems like my most fun debate, so that will be up to my opponent. I will first focus on rebuttals, then my contentions. Note that counter-rebuttals are now switched to this round as my opponent refuted my graphs in round 2, thus I must respond to these refutations or otherwise they will be seen as dropped.==Rebuttal 1: No Major/any Co2 increase==My opponent's graph is a graph of Co2 levels over the past 600 million years. In contrast, my graph is a graph on Co2 levels only throughout the past 650,000 years. My opponent's graph shows as time closes in on the present, the Co2 levels grow lower. However that is because we are looking at a much broader timeline and thus can't see all the needed details in the graph. Yes, we are at an all time low, but that doesn't mean Co2 levels aren't increasing [1]:  I would like to point out that global warming doesn't mandate warming all throughout Earth's life. Global Warming happens anytime when Earth's temperature substantially increases, and that is what is happening. If Co2 levels are increasing, mainly due to human activity, and Earth's temperature rises at the same rate at the same time, then we already have good evidence man-made global warming exists.Also, it seems that my opponent uses a graph by Robert Berner. It is known that Berner's studies are very untrustworthy, especially this one. You can see in the following graph that his graph contains many errors [2]:'History of Atmospheric CO2 through geological time (past 550 million years: from Berner, Science,1997)... The shaded area encloses the approximate range of error of the modeling based on sensitivity analysis...' [2]My opponent then goes on to state that man-made global warming (or even global warming on general) does not exist simply because our Earth has been much hotter before, and then asks, 'may I ask how did we survive that?' However this is a fallacy because:1.) I had already stated that global warming does not mandate a warming all throughout Earth's life, and recently it has been increasing, even though if not by as much as older times. Also, under the circumstances, one degree is still quite substantial.2.) We could not survive in those times as the human race had not even come to being, let alone the dinosaur race. Plus, the animals and forms of life during those times were specially adapted to the hot climate. Also, this is irrelevant as we are only debating the existence of man-made global warming, not if we are going to survive it.3.) Because of the sun being dimmer than now, higher Co2 levels would be needed in order to keep the Earth at a bearable temperature, or else the Earth would literally freeze over. This contention is negated.==Rebuttal 2: The Earth is Actually Cooling==Again, I must remind my opponent that global warming does not mandate warming throughout Earth's life. As you can see at the end of the graph, the temperature slightly increases back, thus proving global warming's existence, and, with the previous information I had given, man-made global warming as well. Just because the Earth has been hotter before doesn't mean it isn't warming again.When my opponent puts up his graph on the cooling of early 2000, again this is misleading, and Easterbrook's predictions have gone wrong from the first 10 years of data collected on the graph. Yet my opponent claims the IPCC studies are incorrect, which is untrue. The evidence is here [3]:    “Figure 5: Don Easterbrook's global temperature graphic presented during the 2010 Heartland conference.” Then, down lower on the cited website [3], it is said:  “So while the IPCC TAR projection was too high by about 0.12°C for the reasons discussed above [on cited website], Easterbrook's projections were too low by 0.28°C and 0.58°C. Despite all of these non-greenhouse gas factors acting in the cooling direction over this timeframe, the IPCC projection was still much closer to reality than Easterbrook's.” [3] On my opponent’s next graph, he shows that each millennium the Earth cools down by 0.3 degrees Celsius (0.54 degrees Fahrenheit) due to Earth’s motion away from the Sun. However, the study was conducted only for the last 2 millennia, when most of the millennia were basically Industrial Revolution and modern activity free. The IR started in 1790 [4]. At the end of the graph, the global temperature abruptly rises above the red line even before 2000, thus proving the existence of global warming, and man-made global warming. This is the same for my opponent’s next two graphs. My opponent’s last graph focuses on the contribution of the Greenhouse gases, and states that the contributions are very low. However that does not negate the existence of global warming or man-made global warming, it simply states that global warming is slow and weak. Thus, this contention is negated. ==Rebuttal 3: Arctic Ice and Sea levels== “First, I would like to state that Pro’s claim about the North Pole completely melting is bogus.” Never in this debate did I ever claim that. This is a straw-man. In my opponent’s Arctic Ice graphs, he shows that since nothing has happened to the Arctic Ice Sheet, global warming, and thus man-made global warming, cannot exist. However, again this is a straw-man since he simply takes a single photo for each year (which only shows the ice on a specific date) and then compares them. It is literally subjective to choose the worst of something on an earlier date and compare it with the best of something on a later specific date. For example, you could say that Whitney Houston is bad because she had an off-day, which is completely untrue. Also, although I don’t believe in all Arctic Ice melting, it is melting slowly and gradually [5]:  And here is a graph on gradually rising sea levels, contradicting my opponent’s [6]:    Thus this contention is negated and proved once again man-made global warming exists. ==Rebuttal 4: The Weather== “My opponent is claiming that Hurricanes are increasing due to Global Warming, but this claim is indeed false!” Again, never in the debate have I claimed that. What’s more, hurricanes aren’t actually linked to global warming in general [7]! “Hurricanes aren't linked to global warming “According to the National Hurricane Center, storms are no more intense or frequent worldwide than they have been since 1850. […] Constant 24-7 media coverage of every significant storm worldwide just makes it seem that way.” (Paul Bedard)” [7] The story is similar for tornadoes as well [8]: “Global warming may well end up making them more frequent or intense, as our intuition would tell us. But it might also actually suppress them—the science just isn't clear yet.” [8] Thus, either way, this contention doesn’t contradict anything about the existence of man-made global warming. ==Contention 3: Oceanic Acidification== A large portion of the Co2 emitted by the atmosphere is absorbed into the ocean. The more Co2 that is emitted into the atmosphere, the more is absorbed into the ocean, and thus the more acidified the ocean becomes [9]. This and warmer temperatures generally cause coral bleaching, which has happened more frequently recently due to its relatively narrow habitable temperature range [10].    Ocean acidification has increased by 30% since the Industrial Revolution [11]. This acidification can harm aquatic organisms, of which organisms that do not need oxygen take place and release greenhouse gases like methane, [12] thus proving that man-made global warming exists. ==Conclusion== I have refuted all my opponent’s arguments and have given out major information to support the existence of man-made global warming. Thus, the resolution stands affirmed.</t>

<t>Got it. From this round I will refer to Carbon Dioxide as CO2.Also, my round 2 sites are incorrectly entered. Here they are in respective order. ==Rebuttal 1:  CO2 and its effects==The statement that humans are not contributing to the emission of greenhouse gases is completely false. Many sites [1-3] point out that humans are, in fact, the most major cause of warming in modern days.'Natural changes alone can’t explain the temperature changes we’ve seen.' - Union of Concerned Scientists [2]'Scientists have closed the case: Human activity is causing the Earth to get hotter.' - Environmental Defense Fund [3]And, if we were to agree with my opponent's logic, then his arguments are contradictory to his third graph - where he states that Carbon Dioxide is correlating with temperatures perfectly, which is true [4][5]: Keep in mind that both charts show increasing temperature and temperature increase rates, but short after the Industrial Revolution began, contrary to my opponent's selective graphs where he tries to disprove warming by selecting a range of 10,000 years, when really the Industrial Revolution only started in the 18th century [6]. My opponent's third graph, as proven, is contradicted by my opponent's statements above. Let us look at his two halves of his chart combined [7]: If the warming effect of CO2 is minimal, then how would the temperature correlate with it so perfectly? And even then, in the years before, the temperature would drop almost instantly after it reached its peak, but the warming period we are in is actually holding itself up there, rather than just being pulled down. Also, we cannot use this graph anyway as the time scale is way too large to see our effects in recent years. Moreover, his charts could be misleading as he has not cited any links to substantiate his second, third and fourth charts. Let us look at his fourth chart.His fourth chart tells us that water vapor and other natural causes cover the vast majority of contributions to the greenhouse effect, whilst human emissions only cover about 0.28% of contributions. However, this is very misleading, because it does not count in ANY OTHER FACTORS. For example, we already know that humans have deforestated the vast majority of forests on Earth [8]:Wildfires, which already contribute to the greenhouse effect [9], are affecting the area of forests worldwide [8]:           Trends in wildlife area burned in wildfire in U.S.    '“Wildfire emissions can have remarkable impacts on radiative forcing,” says Liu.' - USDA [9] 'Tropical deforestation contributes as much as 90% of the current net release of biotic carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This change may represent as much as 20% - 30% of the total carbon flux due to humans - i.e., rivaling the carbon release due to fossil fuel burning.' - Global Change [9]Humans, as shown bove, are acidifying the ocean and deforestating (cutting down trees from forests), which is labeled as one of the more major causes of the greenhouse effect on my opponent's chart. As for my opponent's logarithm argument, this is also contradicting the correlation of CO2 and temperatures because the logarithm would not be able to cause a perfect correlation. Thus this argument is null.==Rebuttal 2: The Earth is cooling==My opponent states that his hot spot argument was dropped, when in reality I had responded to this with two paragraphs of evidence. My opponent is straw-manning here. My opponent even goes on to state that I dropped his CO2 argument, to which I responded with even more text. That went unrefuted by my opponent.Also, the 'Hockey Stick' graph is actually proven many times to be quite accurate (at least in the warming period) by studies of different sources, like corals, stalagmites, tree rings, boreholes and ice cores. All confirm that the 20th century saw the most dramatic increase in global temperatue in recent history.'Since the hockey stick paper in 1998, there have been a number of proxy studies analysing a variety of different sources including corals, stalagmites, tree rings, boreholes and ice cores. They all confirm the original hockey stick conclusion: the 20th century is the warmest in the last 1000 years and that warming was most dramatic after 1920.' - Skeptical Science [10]Note that my opponent's next graph is a very selective one and that its time scale is literally over a ten-year period. Plus, the grap shows the temperature variations, which ends up being above zero. This graph is contradictory to my opponent's arguments.Also, my opponent's quote and evidence that global warming as stopped is also quite selective as it is over a period of 8 years. My opponent is blatantly biased as he only used selective time periods instead of an actually unbiased time period, where it focuses on where humans have been speculated to have started to contribute to global warming.==Rebuttal 3: Arctic Ice and Sea Levels==Again, my opponent's graph here only shows a time period of 45 years. Let us look at a graph starting from 0 CE, and as we can see towards the end the sea level rises dramatically [11]:s://motherjones.com...; alt='Different ways to measure sea level over time' /gt; As you can see the sea level has risen over 20 cm since the start of the Industrial Revolution and has been very consistent throughout this period.My opponent then goes on to reinstate his argument that Arctic Ice is increasing, which I had already refuted with my NASA evidence, which was collected in late 2014, while my opponent uses data from 2006 and 2013. Even then, my opponent only uses two photographs of the Arctic Ice, each from two single, separate days, which again is subjective because it doesn't show anything over time, but rather it only shows separate days. Again disregard this piece of evidence. Also, even though I concede the Antarctic Ice expansion, I had proven Arctic Ice was losing ice more than twice as fast than the Antarctic Ice grew. Thus this point is null.==Rebuttal 4: Hurricanes and Tornadoes==My opponent drops my argument that tornadoes do not link to global warming.My opponent is misunderstanding my hurricane intensity argument. It has been shown that when sea levels rise (which I proved true) stronger hurricanes get stronger, but weaker hurricanes show little to no trend. [12]'But more significantly, Elsner found weaker hurricanes showed little to no trend while stronger hurricanes showed a greater upward trend. In other words, stronger hurricanes are getting stronger. This means that as sea temperatures continue to rise, the number of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes hitting land will inevitably increase.' - Skeptical Science [12]My opponent even states that I dropped his R2 graph, which I responded to throughout the debate. The link was only broken. My opponent keeps straw-manning that I drop his arguments when a lot of my arguments have been left unrefuted. I ask my opponent to stop.==Rebuttal 5: Ocean Acidification==My opponent is saying that since the ocean has not acidified to a certain point that can be deemed critical. However my opponent must notice that small parts of the ocean are acidifying to the point that organisms are dying and being replaced with anaerobic organisms, which produce methane, which further contributes to global warming. Parts of this are directly caused by normal everyday pollution, which an kill animals and bleach corals, which has been proven above to have alreday happened.==Dropped arguments== My opponent drops the following arguments/rebuttals:- That CO2 levels have been ising exponentially over the last few centuries- That CO2 levels 600,000,000 years ago are irrelevant since not even the dinosaurs had existed then- That my opponents graphs are very selective and biased- That the Arctic is losing ice more than twice as fast than the Antarctic is gaining ice- That tornadoes do not have a link to global warming- That ocean acidification, even if not at a critical level, is affecting the temperature of the surroundings.I would like to remind my opponent that he must not respond to these dropped arguments in the last round as I cannot respond to them. Any new rebuttals to these dropped arguments should be disregarded.==Conclusion==I have effectively refuted all my opponent's arguments, countered my own, and also proven that my opponent has dropped some of my arguments.The resolution is affirmed.</t>

<t>I thank my opponent for his arguments, and his speedy response. The framework was depicted thoroughly in the first round, so the framework for the second round will be skipped. I will attempt to address my opposition's short argument, for there are ten thousand characters. May I also point out my opponent has already conceded to a rise in temperature from 1979-1998. I will skip right to the debate.   ==Recent Land Temperatures==   I will start with a straightforward argument, one that is quite often set forward by the pro on this debate topic. To see if the global temperature really is rising, we must look at the big picture, not just data collected from the last ten years. The reason for this is because, as every intelligent scientist knows, the temperature on the Earth is quite unstable, and often affected by sunspots. When the solar activity ceases, periods known as 'maunder minimums' tend to occur. According to one Professor Lockwood, the sun's activity is falling off at a pace not seen in 10,000 years [1]. This happened around 1995-2000, which would explain why the Earth's temperature seems to be 'cooling,' as my opponent argued.    In fact, Drew T. Shindell found that these minimums in solar activity can shave 0.3-0.4 degrees Celsius off of Earth's overall temperature [2]. The study conducted by Shindell found that in the last Maunder Minimum (1600-1700, roughly,) temperatures were widely affected.   'Modeled global annual average surface temperatures were 0.34°C cooler in 1680 than in 1780 [2].'     [6] Since it has been established that the sudden 'stoppage' of global warming can be explained due to sunspots and minimal activity, we can now look at the temperature over the last 50 to 100 years. This is roughly when greenhouse gases skyrocketed, which is believed to be the main cause of global warming. I would also like to state that the graph my opponent set forward was obviously sawed, and came from a non-trustworthy source [3]. My opponent's graph showed two of the following things:   1) Temperature over a 15 year period   2) A slight (possible) temperature fall that can EASILY be accounted to the drop off in solar activity. Also, the graph itself shows the major temperature imbalance, with temperature imbalance reaching up to 1.10 degrees Fahrenheit during 2008, which is minor compared to the 1.30 degree imbalance in 1998.   Results from a much more trustworthy link, NASA, show that temperatures from 1880-2000 (before the drop-off in solar activity) steadily rose 0.8-1 degrees Celsius [4]. Not so coincidentally, methane and carbon dioxide have skyrocketed according to samples taken from both North and South Pole ice [4].   'Despite ups and downs from year to year, global average surface temperature is rising. By the beginning of the 21st century, Earth’s temperature was roughly 0.5 degrees Celsius above the long-term (1951–1980) average.' -Goddard Institute for Space Studies and NASA.  In this graph, we see a variety of different things. First, there is a high imbalance between temperatures. However, we can also observe that the Earth's mean surface temperature has inclined, though not necessarily in a straight line. The data shown by this graph depicts that the temperature of the Earth is rising at a steeper rate over time, which coincides with the increased Co2 emissions over the past decades [5]. It has been shown that the globe is warming (insofar) on land. This satisfies one of the definitions of global warming, which is that the globe is warming on land. As of now, part of the resolution is negated. On to the second part, which will be a rise in oceanic temperatures. ==Oceanic Temperatures== My opponent shows an increase in the polar ice caps (which, as I remind the audience, comes from a non-trustworthy link,) but does not show the size or temperature of any other part of the ocean. It seems like the opponent is focusing on little things that seem to go against global warming, so I will try to look at the big picture. For now, there are graphs explaining the sudden increase in Arctic Ice, such as the following [7]:  As the graph shows above, there has been a general warming across most of the worlds' oceans, which coincides with the atmospheric temperature. In response to the increase in Arctic Ice, we can see there is an isolated spot of cooling, but it is not generally a statistically significant trend. However, the Southern Atlantic Ocean has seen a two degree to a four degree increase in temperature (surface-wise.)Once again, we must look at the big picture. The possible increase in Arctic Ice (from August 2012 to August 2013) could be due to limited sun energy, an anomaly in unstable temperatures, etc. However, much like surface temperatures, the ice/temperature is very rocky, but it is clearly on a downward trend [8]. In fact, the data shows that there is a 3.2% decrease in ice per decade. What con also fails to show is the thickness of the ice, for an increase of thin ice does not necessarily coincide with lowering temperatures.Despite a rise in ice over the past two years, the oceans are undoubtedly hotter and the ice is still quite low. In the same year (2013) as the NASA satellite image was taken, the following statement was concluded:'October ice volume was around 20,000 cubic kilometers (approximately 4,800 cubic miles), meaning that ice volume in October 2013 still ranks among the lowest of the past 30 years.' -National Snow and Ice Data Center. To sum this rebuttal/argument up, we can see there is a small, normal spike around 2012-2013, and then a continuous downward trend from thereafter. In response to the Kevin Trenberth e-mail that my opponent pointed out, I would like to show what the E-mail actually said and meant.'Global warming is still happening - our planet is still accumulating heat. But our observation systems aren't able to comprehensively keep track of where all the energy is going. Consequently, we can't definitively explain why surface temperatures have gone down in the last few years. That's a travesty!' -Kevin Trenberth, ©2009.==Overview of Next Round==I will end this round here having satisfied the definition of 'global warming' and refuted my opponent's arguments. Of course, all of my evidence is very far from being stated. This was just an outline of what my case will look like. In the next round, I will go into further details concerning the following:-Changes in Migration-Animal Behavior-Hottest years on record-Density of Arctic Ice-Co2 Emissions-Glacial RetractionIn conclusion, all my opponent did was falsely state an E-mail and use biased evidence from a non-trustworthy link. He has also conceded that there was a period of warming, and stated a temperature WITHOUT evidence. I ask my opponent link me to his NASA Remote Sensing Systems that says there was an 0.36 degree Fahrenheit climb, because my graphs (which are must trustworthy) state an entirely different story.I thank my opponent for his time, and return the table to him. Good luck. </t>

<t>Global Warming has been highly exaggerated. If you understand climate you should realize there are much more aspects to our atmosphere than CO2 caused by humans . CO2 caused by humans make up less than 4 percent of the C02 in our atmosphere yet politicians believe that we are to blame and that we must try to save the planet through some sort of carbon tax which while magically make the climate change. The simple facts are that CO2 is a RESULT of temperature changes NOT a cause. The climate graphs prove this. There is a 100 year gap in some places between temperatures rises and then the proceeding CO2 rises. The facts are that the majority of CO2 comes from the ocean. When the ocean temperatures rise more CO2 comes off the ocean. Global warming alarmist simply don't take into account the fact that natural causes have produced temperatures to be much higher than they were today and CO2 levels where radically higher thousands of years ago before humans had any impact on the planet. Im not saying the greenhouse effect doesn;t happen or that humans don't have any effect on the climate, what im suggesting is that after a 16 year 'pause' in temperature increases yet human CO2 has gone up greatly in the last decade leads me to believe there is much more to go into the climate change than humans driving SUV and the climate is much more complicated than politicians say it is. All Im saying is I believe this debate should continue because skeptics do have good points.</t>

<t>Thank you Con for starting this debate. I hope to have an interesting and civil dialogue with you. Introduction At first I was unsure if I wanted to take part in this debate. This is because the word 'better' was not clearly defined. By better one could mean that an omnivore diet has tastier food, is more convenient, and for that reason it should be considered 'better.' However, I'm going to interpret the word better to mean that a vegan lifestyle is superior to an omnivore one for various reasons. With that said, let me begin.Definition of veganism according to the Vegan Society: Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose. [1]Veganism is Kinder Towards Animals This, I think, is pretty obvious. In order for animal products to be produced, animals must be exploited. In modern animal agriculture we confine animals for their entire lives and make them miserable. They are denied proper veterinary care, free space to move around and exercise, appropriate social interaction with members of their species, and anesthesia during the process of castration and other mutilations. Once these animals reach market weight, they are sent to a slaughterhouse where they are hung upside down and have their throat slit. In 2013, a USDA inspector at a chicken slaughterhouse pointed out that: '[Workers] are literally throwing the birds into the shackles, often breaking their legs as they do it... They are working so fast, they sometimes get just one leg in the shackles. When that happens, the chickens aren't hanging right... They don't get killed, and they go into the scald tank alive.' [2]In 'Modern Meat: A Brutal Harvest,' a 2001 article from the Washington Post, a worker at a slaughterhouse for cattle describes the disturbing reality of insufficient stunning: 'It takes 25 minutes to turn a live steer into steak at the modern slaughterhouse where Ramon Moreno works. For 20 years, his post was ‘second-legger,’ a job that entails cutting hocks off carcasses as they whirl past at a rate of 309 an hour.  'The cattle were supposed to be dead before they got to Moreno. But too often they weren’t.  'They blink. They make noises,’ he said softly. ‘The head moves, the eyes are wide and looking around.’  'Still Moreno would cut. On bad days, he says, dozens of animals reached his station clearly alive and conscious. Some would survive as far as the tail cutter, the belly ripper, the hide puller.  'They die,’ said Moreno, ‘piece by piece.’ [3]To help put what I have said into perspective, I will link a short documentary by Mercy For Animals that demonstrates some of the things I have been talking about: https://www.youtube.com...Viewing animals as commodities for us to use for our pleasure and convenience is inhumane and disrespectful. If we think it's morally wrong to ignore the suffering of human beings, then we should also think it's morally wrong to ignore the suffering of nonhuman animals that we use for food. Veganism is Better For The Environment Animal production is a major contributor to climate change. In November of 2006 the United Nations came out with a report called ' Livestock's Long Shadow' where they explained that animal production was a bigger contributor to climate change than all of the Earth's cars, trucks, buses, airplanes, and trains combined. The ICPP, which is an intergovernmental panel on climate change, has also said:'Please eat less meat -- meat is a very carbon intensive commodity... this is something that the IPCC was afraid to say earlier, but now we have said it.' [4] According to a study in the UK, dropping meat, dairy and eggs from your diet saves 50% more carbon emissions than driving a Prius. This study showed that an average 2,000 kcal high-meat diet has 2.5 times as many greenhouse gas emissions as an average vegan diet. [5] The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has also said that raising animals for food--including land used for grazing and land used to grow feed crops for farmed animals--now uses a staggering 30% of the Earth's land mass. According to Greenpeace, nearly 80% of land deforested in the Amazon is now used as cattle pasture. [6] Veganism is A Superior Alternative To Fighting World Hunger In the U.S. we feed more than 70% of grain and soybeans to animals, [7] and in doing so we waste most of the food value of the grains that we're feeding them. If all the grain currently fed to livestock in the United States were consumed directly by people, the number of people who could be fed would be nearly 800 million. [8] Depending on the species, the animals may return to us somewhere between 1/10th and 1/3rd of the food value of the grains and soybeans that we put into them. So we are just wasting huge amounts of food in order to produce the large amount of animal products. It would be better and more practical if we fed our grains and soybeans to people, instead of feeding them to billions of land animals. One acre of land can yield 30,000 pounds of carrots, 40,000 pounds of potatoes or 50,000 pounds of tomatoes. However, one acre of land can yield only 250 pounds of meat, which means that a meat, dairy and egg diet is an unsuccessful way to combat world hunger, and that a vegan diet is a superior alternative. This is why Food For Life Global, the world's largest feed the hungry organization, only serves plant based food. As well as Everybody Gets Fed, Earth Save and Plenty. A Well Planned Vegan Diet is Healthy According to the American Dietetic Association, America's largest organization of health care professions:  'appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.' [9]Conclusion If we take animal welfare, the environment and world hunger into account, and ask ourselves which lifestyle is most beneficial, it seems like a vegan lifestyle is the better choice. In this paper I have provided various reasons for thinking that, and so I believe we are committed to the idea that veganism is superior. The resolution is upheld.Sources in comments</t>

<t>Thank you Con for presenting your arguments.    Con stated in the rules at the beginning of the debate that I will not be allowed to argue in round 5. For that reason, this will be my last round to post arguments for this debate.NatureCon says that if I'm going to claim that eating animals is morally wrong, I need to provide a reason for why that is the case. In my first round of arguments of this debate, I said that it's morally wrong because it involves animal exploitation. These animals are forced to live a life full of pain and suffering. Not only that, but they are also killed prematurely at the slaughterhouse. Now, one may ask, why is it wrong to inflict pain on sentient animals? I would say it's wrong because pain is a sensation whose absence is intrinsically desired. Why is it wrong to kill sentient animals prematurely? It's wrong because it deprives them of a valuable future it could have, and thwarts the current desires they have like desires for food, sex, and being outside on a warm day. Con says that our ancestors ate meat for a long time, and that they needed to do so for survival. This is more of a statement of fact rather than an argument. However, it seems like Con is saying that because our ancestors ate meat for a long time, it is therefore morally justified. This line of argument is a fallacy, because it's an appeal to tradition. In the U.S., owning African Americans as slaves used to be a tradition. But does that mean owning other human beings was justified? No, clearly not. In the same way, just because we have been eating animals for a long time does not mean that we should continue to do so. Nutrition It's true that meat provides vitamin B12, and that this nutrient is of extreme importance. However, vegans can obtain vitamin B12 from taking a supplement or eating foods fortified with it. So meat eaters don't actually have an advantage here when it comes to B12. Con may object that if vegans have to supplement or eat foods fortified with this nutrient, this means that a vegan diet is unnatural. However, this argument would be an appeal to nature fallacy. Just because something is natural or unnatural does not mean it's good or bad. Many of the things we do nowadays could be considered unnatural. Driving a car, flying in an airplane, using a cell phone, debating others online, ect. could all be considered unnatural. As registered dietitians Jack Norris and Virginia Messina point out in their book 'Vegan for Life.''Today's commercial plant foods and meat are different from the foods available in prehistoric times. We eat hybrids of plants and we feed foods to animals that they would not normally eat. Additionally, the U.S. food supply is routinely fortified with a host of vitamins and minerals. Even those people who strive to eat a more 'natural' diet as adults have normally benefited from fortified foods as children. It is quite unlikely that anyone is eating a natural diet in today's world.' [1] I'm still not convinced that meat is a superior source of protein. Meat has cholesterol, saturated fat, and no fiber in it. However, a cup of cooked lentils has 18 grams of protein, fiber, no cholesterol, and is under 1 gram of fat. [2]Veganism is Kinder Towards Animals Con says we were designed to be omnivores since the beginning. It's true that human beings are omnivores, however, we are not obligate omnivores. We can be healthy without eating animal products. They are not necessary for good nutrition. Veganism is Better For The Environment Con asked me how animals produce more greenhouse gases than all of transport. To put it simply, the world's 1.5 billion cows and billions of other grazing animals emit dozens of polluting gases, including lots of methane. [3] Methane is produced by farting and belching cows. So, since we raise huge amounts of animals for food each year, and each of them produces polluting gases, it's not hard to see how they would produce more than transport. In sum, a lot of animals, a lot of polluting gases, equals serious problems for the environment. Conclusion Overall,  I think I have shown how a vegan lifestyle is better than a meat eating one. It's better for the animals, will provide more food for hungry people, and is better for the environment. This would all be true even from the perspective of the individual instead of society. Finally, thank you Con for a enjoyable debate.</t>

<t>Enviomentalism is a religion not climate change. We do not have to live eternally to see the effects of global warming. Of course we can not predict the outcome of the global warming other than we know it has happened frequently in the past. The climate has a cycle where ice age is the last stage (or the first depending on how you put it). Global warming follows the average temperature of the earth. This does not mean that all over the world it will get hotter. Global warming does not only result in warmer temperatures, but also in more violent storms, more violent earthquakes etc. We can prove climate change by just looking at pictures of glaciers now and 50 years ago.</t>

<t>Sorry for late delivery of this argument: I flew to New York to visit family during Christmas.  To correct my opponents reasoning, 'humans' advanced thinking does not benefit the common good.' Whether humans' ability to think clearly and rationally is objectively great, there is no 'common good' when it comes to inter-species contact. If you have ever watched the PBS program 'Nature', you know that it is usually a zero-sum game when it comes to survival. Our skills are good for US and that is what matters. My opponent also said, 'the Earth will crumble to global warming in a couple decades', which is completely null and void because global warming is a natural phenomenon that has been occurring since the end of the last ice age 14,000 years ago. I will not debate whether global warming is a real threat (or as real as eco-freaks make it out to be), nor if it is humans' fault- that is not the purpose of this debate (however, for the record, human beings are innocent in the climate change theory). My opponent then went further, 'we single handedly destroyed billions of years of progress to produce life forms as they are today'. Now, the term 'progress' was used very, very loosely here. Progress as in 'the evolution and random turn of events that resulted in the current state of things'? If that is what you mean, then what 'we' have done is merely played our part in evolution- the weak are trampled and the strong go on to victory. It may seem wrong to justify it like that but be REALISTIC, human beings are a species like all others that is fighting against all odds for survival, we just happened to be WINNING, sorry about that.  Environmentalists and the irrationalists like them enjoy weighing the benefit of one INDIVIDUAL thing against the burden of the entire COLLECTIVE thing (as in, 'is the iPhone 6 really better than the commonwealth of everything?'). This can get annoying to rational people, so allow me to turn the tables. Is the entire production of everything that supports BILLIONS of people all over the world that has lasted throughout human history and has benefited countless people just like your self better than preserving a certain sub-species of cheetahs?  Also, my opponent said that 'in a couple million years, we've destroyed this planet' as a rebuttal to my statement that 'we own this planet'. I was speaking metaphorically, as in our immense power over the planet, and my opponent took this literally and came up with an even DUMBER statement: 'we've destroyed the planet'. Really? We've destroyed it? Because when I look around, I see people shopping at supermarkets and living in heated, lighted homes and working with easy tasks instead of hunting for buffalo. I see barren land (objectively, of course) being transformed into neighborhoods that help families and individuals live lives that the kings of 500 years ago (before mass pollution) could never dream of.  Then my opponent said something so hypocritical, and really gave his debate away: 'Many humans do live on the brink of starvation, fighting predators to survive another day'. My opponent advocates environmentalism, which supports only those who live in such a way; you outlined a global tragedy that can only be solved by human beings who do NOT support environmentalism. When mining and manufacturing companies move into impoverished villages, they pay off the landowners and villagers and often build houses worth much more in order to give the villagers a place to live. Environmentalists constantly try to stop this with lawsuits. By your logic, all people should live like that.  You said that humans invented war. In a strong sense of the word, yes, you are correct. Yet, does this not stem from a purpose? Ideas. People have ideas, sometimes political or religious. These ideas have gotten us very far, indeed. Sometimes, however, people have conflicting ideas and one of them wants to force his ideas on the other. This results in a war. You have proven yourself wrong, by admitting that humans are the only species that have ideas to fight about.  Most bad things that have been done by humans (such as genocide) have been done by irrationalists (like yourself). Collectivism, communism, subjectivism, environmentalism, nationalism, racism, are all things that cause wars and devalue man. All of these things fall under the category of irrationalism, they are forms of philosophy that the Nazis follow.  The bad deeds of a few should not reflect poorly on the good done by everyone else. However, you are a collectivist and believe that humans, plants, animals, sand, and communists are all the same in terms of rights. There is no debating here.</t>

<t>My opponent started with a quote from an environmentalist basically saying that humans have to be wiped out. This is a very extreme measure of what I am trying to say. My opponent has earlier said, 'the bad deeds of a few should not reflect poorly on the good done by everyone else,' which proves my point and makes the quote entirely null and void. He said I 'must consider trees and 'the millions of different life forms inside them' vastly more important than human beings like you and me,' but he is merely and desperately trying to incriminate me. Millions, if not billions of organisms, in my opponent's thinking are nothing compared to, in the scenario he described, at most 100 people. This is the sort of idea that sparks one of humans's creations: genocide. Then he began going very extremely into this ideal, but viruses such as Ebola are not actually organisms, and therefore cannot feel. 'Murdering' Ebola would have the same effect on Ebola as kicking a rock would on the rock. Can the rock feel? No, and neither can viruses and the other examples my opponent was implying. Then he went on to call me evil. He, all throughout this debate, has been attacking me personally, calling me a evil genocidal Nazi communist. This only proves he has realized that I have already won this debate, and is just angry with me. I am, in his opinion, 'preoccupied with the bad parts of human life.' Well, as I have proven, most of the 'advances' of the human race have resulted in problems for the last couple hundred years. I didn't skip over his point that 'the iPhone 6 is not a main source of pollution,' I proved it was wrong. I have been using the iPhone 6 as an EXAMPLE, not the sole reason against humanity. In the above round, I talk more about this, so I did respond to his point. 'Mass production of things we don't need stands in the way of preservation, but we don't have to become animals to help them. Do we need the iPhone 6, or the countless things a needless as it? No. But ignoring other beings because they are not vital to our own survival is different. You feel compassion for a dying animal on the side of the road, but not a broken phone,' to quote myself. In the final debate, I will provide again my two main arguments used in the first round:  1-Humans don't know when to stop: My opponent has mainly focused on this argument, but still has not proven it wrong. As you will see if you scroll through this page, humans have, yes, destroyed the Earth. My opponent 'refuses to debate global warming,' but that's OK, because there are so many other examples I've shown throughout this debate: extinction, deforestation, and so on.  2-Humans are the most death-obsessed race: My opponent mentioned this once to partially agree with it. He used a weak refutation that war was about ideas, but there are other ways to prove an idea, and if you can kill more people than the other guy, that doesn't mean you're right. No other species has killed another of its own species purposefully for reasons other than cannibalism.  Now, a couple more reasons I have provided throughout: Humans are the only mammal incapable of making their own vitamin C, the cat vs. criminal example (a criminal is not better than a cat, is it? A cat may not have ever done anything bad, but a criminal sure has. That's why he's a criminal. The cat is better than the criminal), and weighing on scope (more animals than humans).  My opponent has failed to refute any of my points while I have effectively refuted all of his. I have obviously and indisputably won this debate.</t>

<t>AGW exists, it but doesn't dominate climate Greenhouse gases cause warming, and I never claimed otherwise. Pro cited a skeptical climate scientist acknowledgment that AGW plays some role in climate. Our resolution is “Global warming is man made.” That might mean that global warming is entirely man made, in which case Pro has conceded it is not, because he has acknowledged that there are also natural causes. I didn't take that meaning. I said repeatedly that Pro must prove that climate is dominated by AGW. I must prove it does not. The proof of AGW would be a AGW math mathematical model of climate that accurately explains and predicts. Weather effects are yearly variations; climate comprises trends over several years. The AGW models fail because the models do not predict or explain climate the large trends in climate. For example, Pro acknowledges that Medieval Warm Period was due to solar activity, but the official IPCC models have no mechanism that explains the MWP. Because AGW models cannot explain the MWP, climate crisis advocates have fought consistently to make the MWP disappear as a global climate phenomena. The Hockey Stick got rid of it by a statistical error, but the data ultimately won. A change in climate acknowledged to be very close to modern warming is unexplained by the models we are supposed to accept as reliable. The pause in global warming is real Pro argued that an 17 year pause in global warming might just be “noise,” and he cited a scientific paper that allegedly shows that. That's bad science. Suppose an engineer designed a building taking into account all the other factors he knew to affect design, and the building subsequently collapsed. Consider: “The design models were correct. The building collapsed due to unknown factors categorized as noise. There is no need for further explanation.” Nonsense. Fundamental failures are not noise. An eighteen year failure of climate prediction shows that the model is defective. Since AGW is in the model, and something else canceled it, the unknown factor dominated climate over the period. I quoted both HADCru and NASA scientists as acknowledging the pause in global warming. The paper by AGW-advocate von Storch established that the current models cannot be tweaked to explain the pause. Pro found some oddball paper that made a model that shows a pause, but models can be made to do anything desired. AGW theory is not validated until after it makes accurate predictions. Making a new, unproved model means we are back to the starting point. Pro said that HADCru land data showed an increase. Year-to-year variations occur with weather, and so there is so uncertainty in the trends due to the accuracy of fitting a line through the weather-induced variations. The HADCru data shows 0.09 +/- 0.11 degree of global warming over the period of the pause, compared to the 0.4 to 1 degree predicted by the AGW models. None of the six global temperature data sets showed a statistically significant increase. [http://wattsupwiththat.com...] The land data sets are the least accurate because increasing urbanization drives up the temperatures near many of the weather station locations, due to the so-called “heat island” effect. The satellite data is the most accurate because it samples the earth uniformly, and it shows no increase. HADCru scientists understand the large departure from the models, and acknowledge the pause. Pro said I acknowledged that the Sun could not be causing the pause in global warming. That's not true, but if it were true, it would not help Pro's case. If it's not the sun, then a completely unsuspected factor dominated climate and overwhelmed AGW. However, what I acknowledged was that the length of the previous solar cycle was not a good predictor. I presented the historical graph that showed the level of sunspot activity correlated well with the warmth of the MWP, the cold of the Little Ice Age, and the warming of the 20th century. Pro acknowledged the solar cause of those changes. Sunspots do not correlate to the heat output of the sun, so the effect on climate must be a different physical cause: magnetic field, cosmic rays, ultraviolet spectrum, or something else. It might be some complex combination of the effects. The graphs show that cold climate is associated with low sunspot activity and warm climate with high sunspot activity. The 20th century covered a long period of high sunspot activity, which explains the warming. Recently, sunspot activity has dropped, correlated to the pause. The number of sunspots remains a reliable longer term climate predictor. AGW predicts straight line temperature increase I presented a graph showing actual global temperatures and AGW predicting a strong straight line increase. My graph is accurate, but I should have better explained the AGW line in comparison to the actual climate data. Here is the graph, repeated from the earlier round:   Temperature responds to the logarithm of greenhouse gas density, and greenhouse gas density has been increasing exponentially. The log of an exponential is a straight line. As far as I know, all climate scientists agree on this. Therefore, AGW should produce a straight line. Pro said that the models also include some natural effects like volcanoes, so the model predictions need not be a straight line increase. However, the debate resolution is that AGW dominates climate. While natural causes upset the perfect straight line behavior to some degree, they cannot dominate. While there may be some blips, like the blip of cold for a couple years from the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo, there should be no problem recognizing a straight line. The temperature data is not close to any straight line, so AGW is not dominating. We are far below what the models predict for the present year. The slope of the line of temperature increase over time depends both on climate sensitivity and the rate of carbon dioxide increase. The behavior of temperature with CO2 is logarithmic, so Pro's computation of what it should be is way off. Initially a small increase in CO2 produces a large increase in temperature, with later increases in CO2 having less and less effect. Suppose CO2 increased in units from 1 to 16, and that the increase from from 1 to 2 brought one degree of warming. That means that there would be four degrees of warming at 16, CO2 having doubled four times. Linear interpolation, which is what Pro did, between 1 and 16 says that there should be (1/15) of the 4 degrees, 0.27 degree, at 2 units. In fact, there was 1 degree of increase at the 2 unit point, four times as much as linear interpolation erroneously yields. The temperature rise is not line between 1 and 2 or between 2 and 4, or anywhere on the curve. I converted the combined effect of climate sensitivity and CO2 increase into a linear number of degrees increase per century increase. The official estimate by the US Environment Protection Agency, referencing the IPCC, is 2.2 to 6.1 degrees C by 2100. (I converted from the EPA's F) [http://www.epa.gov...] That's 2.6 to 7.1 degrees per century. The range includes both the allowed variation in the estimates of climate sensitivity and the possibility that CO2 output may drop near the end of the century, as substitutes for fossil fuels become more significant. Departure from exponential growth is in the future so I used 3 degrees per century to represent the low end of climate sensitivity estimates that AGW theory allows. It's a coincidence that matches 3 degrees for doubling CO2. The earth should have warmed by 0.4 to 1 degree since 2000, but in fact as measured by the satellites there was no change, and in all data sets show no statistically significant change. The graph shows temperature anomaly, so where the blue line ought to originate depends upon when one believes AGW began to dominate climate. AGW theory was invented to explain the temperature rise from about 1980 to 1996, so that's where I put the AGW prediction line. The Hockey stick claimed that nothing happened to climate for a thousand years before about 1970. If the claim is that AGW dominated the entire 20th century, then the line should start at 1900. If climate sensitivity is 0.7, way below any AGW official estimate, then the line is about 0.5 degree per century. and AGW no longer explains the rise in the 80s and 90s. Wrong consensus derives from common error When science reaches a wrong consensus, scientists point to the data that they used to proclaim that the wrong consensus is well founded. I gave several examples. For AGW, it was the rapid temperature increase in the 80s and 90s that “proved” the theory. Some AGW is in the climate, but the long pause proves it is not the dominant factor. Paleoclimate In the hundred million year history of climate, CO2 shows no relation to temperature. The laws of nature do not change. It's not enough to say that things were different back then. The changes in the orbit of the earth were too small to explain the climate variation. The likely missing link is the solar variation other than heat output that caused the MWP. CO2 released from the ocean will increase heating, and CO2 going back into solution will amplify cooling. Those are natural, not anthropogenic, factors and they do nothing to explain what drives the trend in either direction. (I wrongly identified my reference for the lag in CO2; it's 3-5.) The Debate Pro's rules for the debate say that we have an equal burden to prove that AGW does or not dominate climate. That's fine with me. If AGW was the dominant factor in climate, then we should have observed a straight line increase in temperature since 1980, and we clearly have not. Since Pro has not met his burden of showing that AGW dominates, I've met my burden to show it has not. Thanks to Pro for a fine debate. It will be most fascinating to people interested in logarithms.</t>

<t>Contention 1: No Major/any CO2 Increase.      Many Global Warming advocates state that CO2 levels are skyrocketing, but that is incorrect. I give you the above graph measuring the past 600 million years of CO2 levels are we are actually at an all time low. Now the website I got this from no longer has this page up so I appologize. We can see from observance of this graph that we being at all time CO2 low levles that we are nowhere close to meeting the impact that my opponent brings up. We have been over 5,000 ppm of CO2 in our atmosphere and are now currently around apprx. 350 ppm CO2 levels.  The above graph shows that comparisions of C13 (Carbon isotope) and this shows that there is little to no trend pertrade in many of these as the average is zero while the trend for all of these are zero. (http://www.drroyspencer.com...) This is important as the Carbon isotope is important in measuring this so called 'Global Warming.'  This chart above shows the CO2 and Earth's temperatures for the past 600 million years. My opponent's claims are incorect as we have had aburd levels of CO2 and temperature on Earth and may I ask how did we survive that? (http://www.sustainableoregon.com...)  Now I will move on to how Earth is actually cooling and how it's temperature is cooler than it has been. Contention 2: Earth is cooling.  If we observe the above graph we can see that Earth has been a whole lot hotter than where we currently are to the point where the Earth's average temperature has been 7.5 degrees Celcuis hotter than it currently it is. You can also see that in the span of the past 10,000 years the temperature has leveld off, but you may ask yourself where does that place us in the lights of modern day?  I am going to site Dr. Done Easterbrook, who is a climate scientist. Back in 2000 he predicted that Earth was entering a cooling phase. He predicts that for the next 20 years Earth will cool by 3/10 degree each year and that we are going to enter another little Ice Age like we did from 1650 and 1790. (http://www.cnsnews.com...)  The funny thing is that many of my opponent's charts are actually from the incorrect IPPC. How about the 'Hockey Stick' graph that many Global Warming supporters , including my opponent, argue about? Well if we observe the fallowing chart taken from Northern Scandenavia we can see that the Global trend over the past 1,000 years that the Global Cooling trend slope is that of -0.31 Degrees Celcuis, give or take 0.03 degrees (for the error room). Professor Dr. Jan Esper has found that the Earth's temperature of Earth actually decreases 0.3 per millenia due to the Earth moving away from the sun. (http://newsbusters.org...)   Here is another graph from 1920 to 2005 and we can see that the graph has a negative temperature slope, thus meaning that the Earth is under a period of cooling. (http://blog.chron.com...)  Contention 3: Artic Ice. First, I would like to state that Pro's claim about the North Pole completely melting is bogus. Al Gore stated that the Artic Ice would be completely melted by 2014, but he is incorrect then and now.  Jan. 6, 2012: The Coast Guard Cutter Healy breaks ice around the Russian-flagged tanker Renda 250 miles south of Nome. The Healy is the Coast Guard’s only currently operating polar icebreaker. The vessels are transiting through ice up to five-feet thick in this area. The 370-foot tanker Renda will have to go through more than 300 miles of sea ice to get to Nome, a city of about 3,500 people on the western Alaska coastline that did not get its last pre-winter fuel delivery because of a massive storm. (http://www.thegatewaypundit.com...)  Let's go back to 2007-2008 and see if his claim was justified in the Artic Ice activity.  Hmmm... It seems that he is incorrect, but let's look further into the near past. How about 2012-2013? (http://ginacobb.typepad.com...)  We all remember the Climate Scientists that got stuck in Arctic Ice Earlier this year correct? Then a Russian Ice Breaker tried to free them, but got stuck. Can you guess what they were studying? They had predicted that all the Arctic Ice had melted due to Global Warming and that Earth would get flooded massively. Boy were they wrong. (http://www.nytimes.com...)   (http://www.americasfreedomfighters.com...)  How about Al Gore. The man who brought Global Warming to our attention? In 2009, the man breaks down in tears stating how it's nothing, but hot air and how he fabricated everything just for the money! He said the arctic sheets are not melting and CO2 is not responsible for depletion of the Ozone. (http://www.thomaspeep.com...) Dr. Koonin, former head of the Department of Energy under President Obama, has stated that the Global Warming scare is not suttle. This is because that he has found 3 things wrong and highly incorrect about the scare. 1. Shrinking of Artic Sea ice doesn't acount for the gaining of the Antartic ice. 2. The warming of Earth's temps today is the same as it was 30 years ago. 3. The sea levels rose at the same height and rate in the 20th cenury. (http://www.newsmax.com...)  Contention 4: Sea Levels  Here is another corralation that must happen. If the Ice Caps are completely melted as Pro claims then the sea level would have risen completely drowning tons of land.  The graph above is raw satellite image data of the sea level rise over an 8 year period showing that there is little to no change in the Sea Levels rising. (http://joannenova.com.au...) The sea level rises, on average, about 3 inches per century and it has been found to not even been rising at all.  This graph is the sea levels off the cost of French Guyana which is one of the areas which is predicted to be flooded due to Global Warming, but as you can see by the graph (which goes to 2008) the sea level is currently on a downward trend.(http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org...) The source is the PDF within the link.Contention 5: The Weather My opponent is claiming that Hurricanes are increasing due to Global Warming, but this claim is indeed false! The hurricanes since the year 1900 to 2008 have actually been decreasing. The slope of this downward slope is .0016. Though it is small the hurricanes are still in a downward trend.As a matter of fact not only are Hurricanes on a downward trend, but they are at an all time low as in the year 2010, there was only 68 Hurricanes Globally, which is an all time low in the past 40 years. (http://wattsupwiththat.com......) How about Tornados you may ask? In the graph above you can see that tornados are at an all time low in the past 60 years! (http://wattsupwiththat.com...)  But what about Hurricanes?Here is a graph showing the number of days between hurricanes and this shows that the number of days between hurricanes is greatest at 76 days between hurricanes.The slope of this line is zero showing no trend of a massive storm increase.Now I must end my argument here before I run out of my characters.

He does not look at the bigger picture, at the general decline from year 1000 to modern time, or even from millions of years ago to now, there has been the similar pattern regardless of CO2 emissions. And even if CO2 does create global warming, (which, really, it's not even the main cause--global warming happens naturally due to climate changes, heavily due to changes in solar activity [source: http://www.breitbart.com...], it's not bad to us at all. 'CO2 levels are so low that more, not less, is needed to sustain and expand plant growth.', 'if CO2 levels are cut, he warns, food production will slow because plants grown at higher CO2 levels make larger fruit and vegetables and also use less water. ', and finally, 'Earth's atmosphere currently has about 338 parts per million of CO2 ....the danger level for carbon dioxide isn't reached until the air has 8,000 parts per million of CO2.' All of these quotes, from http://www.usnews.com..., show that CO2 not only helps the environment (remember who you are, Brazil, when you remember cut down their rate of deforestation!) it does not harm us humans at all.   Opponent has failed to uphold his burden of proof. He does evoke philosophical stances within euthanasia, and he even goes for environmental effects.

<t>I thank my opponent for their opening round. While I'll make some general comments as to the trend of the debate, I will refrain from posting actual rebuttals until the subsequent round, as per the Instigator's rules.I am actually astounded at the position presented. I was expecting graphs, tables and data. Instead, we have been presented a point of view, which is axiomatic of the anti-climate change position. We have been presented an opinion. To open my case, let me make something robustly clear. Science does not function on the basis of opinion, and to present opinion is to concede evidence. Science is apolitical.As it stands, I agree with Pro on one point: don't follow the crowd. Instead, follow the peer-reviewed scientific literature. I take substantial grievance with the sources provided by Pro but unfortunately am constrained by the rules not to explain their absurdity until the following round. Rest assured that they will be thoroughly scrutinised and I intend to tear them apart.Onto the evidence. It's not two-sidedThe popular Western narrative is to provide 'unbiased coverage' of stories. In most cases, this is important. However, on science topics, opinion has nothing to do with anything. Facts are facts. Something is either true, or not true, and the only thing that we can use to determine whether something is true is evidence. To have two people on a talk-show, one a climate scientist and one an ostensible nobody claiming that climate scientists are the devil's children and work for multinationals is patently absurd because it misrepresents the scientific consensus (discussed below). It is not a 50/50 split. Evidence favours anthropogenic climate change, and stuffing our fingers in our ears will not refute this. If you want to disprove climate change, you must use evidence.ConsensusOf course, it would be an argument from popularity to stipulate that purely because the majority thinks something, it is true. It amounts to a special form of anecdotal evidence. However, it's a good place to start looking at why the independent scientific community agrees. As it happens, 97% of peer-reviewed papers published on the topic have found that humans are causing substantial changes to climate (1). The scientific community is clear. There is no 'teaching the controversy' because there is no controversy (2). Stop making science political because agendas don't change facts.Yeah, but, like, the climate has changed before and stuff...or whateverTrue. But not like this (3). It appears that there have been around 5 ice ages in earth's past (4). There have also been other variations in climate not related to ice ages. However, let's talk about anthropogenic climate change. The hypothesis is that as CO2 increases, we should see a general increase in global temperatures. Is this the case?Well, it would appear so. But have statistical controls accounted for extraneous variables and clarified that this is anthropogenic?Well, yeah, they kinda have. Despite attempts at finding plausible natural explanations for the climate variation, no natural fluctuations account for the observed trends (5).Rounding offThe scientific illiteracy of climate conspiracy theorists is a fundamental contributor to their perpetuation of the disinformation agenda of the corporate elite. While I obviously have substantially more evidence and could potentially just post hundreds of links to peer-reviewed journals, I prefer the argumentation. Perhaps this is sufficient for my introduction, and we'll clash next round with increased vigour when I can rebut your arguments.Best of luck in your following round.</t>

<t>My opponent concedes that man-made global warming is, in fact, real.While at this point I would usually proceed by simply extending my previous arguments until the end of the debate, I feel that particularly poor sportsmanship has been demonstrated by my opponent. Far from constructing baseless ad hominem conjectures against my opponent, I simply deconstructed common mistakes regarding anthropogenic climate change that are made by climategate proponents. My opponent does not genuinely feel disrespected; they recognise that their position is untenable and that the belief that has been instilled in them by their right-wing, science-hating parents does not reflect anything close to observation. You're not offended; you just know you're wrong.My objective is now not to convince you, which I have already done, but to convince our audience. Rebuttals from first roundMy opponent stated that, '[...]an ice age goes through two phases. The first one is the obvious 'freezing' phase and the second phase is a predominantly warm one(see link 1).'While this isn't quite what the source indicates, it's basically right. There are periods of glaciation, and periods of warming. Cooling and warming are not uniform. I'd just like to quickly examine the way you've phrased this, though. Basically you're saying, it gets cold, then it gets warm. Well, obviously. If it stayed cold, we'd still be in an ice age. If it stayed warm, there'd never be ice ages. That's not helpful information.You then say, '[we are] going back into the cold phase.' Erm, nope.  I mean, we are getting cooler...if by cooler, you mean the temperature is rising.You then said, 'At both poles there is rapidly growing ice.'Your article goes on a right-wing binge-fest with absolutely no understanding of why that is happening. It makes specific reference to Antarctica. Yes. Sea ice is growing. This is because of strengthening westerly winds blowing sheets of snow and cold air further from the coast of the Antarctic continent(1). The strengthening winds are one indication of climate change(1). Further, while the sea ice spreads in geographic area, global ocean and atmospheric temperatures continue to increase. Looking at the data for a single year (i.e. we hit a record this year) is not indicative of trend. This mistake is confusing weather for climate, and is a common error. You're also looking at a single factor in isolation, and ignoring the rest of the data.Here's an informative video by Veritasium who describes the process and debunks some myths with the aid of some fun animations: https://www.youtube.com...The preponderance of the evidenceThe preponderance of the evidence, the consensus of the scientific literature, the data: 'The Earth’s climate is changing rapidly as a result of anthropogenic carbon emissions, and damaging impacts are expected to increase with warming' (Knutti amp; Hegerl, 2008)(2).Once again, if you wish to demonstrate that the models are incorrect, then you must supply the evidence that climate change is not occurring. Your reasons for doubting the science are political. Wanting something to be true or false has no bearing on whether it is true or false. Environmental refugeesWe are going to see floods of environmental refugees as a result of rising sea levels. How can one simply ignore this information?- The pacific island nation of Kiribati has just finalised the purchase of land in Fiji to initially grow crops on after their domestic agriculture was destroyed by encroaching seawater, then as a place to relocate once their entire country sinks(3). New Zealand will have to grant the population what functionally amounts to environmental asylum.- Tuvalu is going to sink and the population will need evacuating (4, 5)- This is just the start of implications for changes to the climate.Summing upMy opponent had the burden of proof in demonstrating that global warming is a hoax. This has not yet been done, and if last round is anything to go by, I suspect my opponent will concede defeat. However, it would be interesting to hear his take. So, I ask you the following questions:- What is your evidence for the hoax?- Who initiated the hoax?- Why did they initiate it? What's the motive?- How is it the case that the independent scientific community, meteorologists and government bodies have separately and through peer-review arrived at the same or similar conclusions? If it was false, wouldn't the claims be widely varying?- Who is the chief orchestrator of this grand conspiracy? They must have a leader since all their claims are the same.- Is their really more profit to be found by scientists conducting research, than by massive oil cartels, coal and gas miners, and refiners and importers? Is renewable energy really going to earn more money for solar-cell syndicates than fossil fuels will for the energy industry?Perhaps the conspiracy is, in fact, on the other side. Until next round, if you decide to defend your position.</t>

<t>In response to the claimed censorship.1.     The accusation about the censorship of opposing views on the FDR forums is not sourced or justified, and from a quick look at the forums it seems that the opposite is the case. It can be seen that Stefan is open to differing opinions, and respects them if they are presented in a calm and non-aggressive manner. This forum thread {1} is an example of a post in which Stefan is directly said to be wrong on an important issue, and, in it, Stefan replies with, quote, “Thank you so much for the information, I had no idea, I really appreciate you sharing, I will have a look in detail[.]”2.     Most, if not all, of the videos in the playlist you linked that were taken down as a result of copyright claims by FDR only consisted of the audio from FDR shows with occasional captioning and commentary in text-form. These videos clearly violate copyright law, and, regardless of Stefan’s opinion on IP rights, it cannot be said that taking them down is “suppressing dissent” or is “cultlike behaviour”. At worst, you are accusing him of being a hypocrite – that does not help you in fulfilling your BOP.      In response to the “Insane/Cultish Claims”  1.  Just for the record, Stefan has publically recanted his views on homosexuality that you mentioned {2}.                                  2.   The majority of the claims on your list are just said to be “insane/cultish”, with no justification as to why this is so (and, with your definition of “cult leader”, I don’t see how any of these directly support the idea that FDR is a cult), just that they are supported by Molyneux. No reasons are given for most of the claims as to why they aren’t valid, as if they are just to be accepted as being such because of some self-evident nature they possess. Even if they were completely and utterly debunked, it would be irrelevant to the debate – one is not a “cult leader”, even by the definition given by PRO, just because they support unorthodox or irrational ideas. As such, these videos do nothing to further the fulfillment of the BOP by PRO, and I do not need to respond any further to them.     In response to Stefan’s support of DEFOO-ing I must ask, if the idea of DEFOO-ing is cult-like, would it not follow that most of the modern western world would be cultists? Stefan does NOT universally support DEFOO-ing - he does not want all children to disassociate themselves from their families. He advocates doing so in the cases of emotional or physical abuse – this is to be done for the child’s own sake, not in order for them to be “better devoted” to Molyneux or whatever other sinister theory. Molyneux is applying the concept of a battered spouse leaving the abuser to familial relationships. There is nothing more “cult-like” about this than there is about women supporting that wives who are being consistently harmed should leave the source of the harm, if they can. It is baseless to assert that Stefan is a cult-leader because of this.      {1} https://board.freedomainradio.com... {2} https://www.youtube.com...</t>

<t>Resolved: That Global Warming is not significantly affected by humans I thank the opponent for the debate challenge. As the opponent has not defined any terms, the definition of the terms shall go as follows: Global Warming: Noun The unequivocal rise of the global average temperature; also attributed to the unpredictable climate in the world. [1] Significantly: Adverb In a sufficiently great or important way as to be worthy of attention. [2] Humans: Noun Mankind, homo-sapiens,  Affected: Adjective  Influenced or touched by an external factor. [2]   Since this debate resolution is a normative resolution, the Burden of Proof is shared. For the opponent to win, he has to prove that humans have almost no responsibility in causing global warming.   With this said, the introduction and the proof that global warming exists shall be shared first, as this debate cannot go on with the assumption that it exists, as assumptions are inherently detrimental.    Axiom One: Global Warming Necessarily Exists   Global warming is no longer a possibility, but it is indeed a necessity. There has been an increase of 0.8 degrees Celsius in the last 100 years, with 0.7 degrees Celsius of this increase happening in the last 30 years [3]. From 1880, the temperature of the world was recorded via NASA meteorological stations; this data proved vital in identifying a change in temperature. From 1980 upwards, one can see a very high increase in the mean temperature of the world; the running average of global temperature from 1980 has increased by almost 100%.    This graph, compiled by NASA GISS from data provided by many sources, confirms that Global Warming necessarily exists, as can be seen via the sharp increase of the running average from 1980.   Global Warming exists; there is no doubt. Then what causes Global Warming? It is us, humans, that cause Global Warming.   Proposition One: Carbon Dioxide Release from Multiple Sources    Global warming has been allegedly caused by an excess of Co2 release from the ocean and multiple other sources. Accordingly in 2000, 29.5% of Co2 emissions came from power stations, 20.6% from Industrial Inputs/Outputs, 11.3% from residences and 9.1% from land use/biomass. [4] In 2008, 8.37 billion tons of Co2 was released from multiple of human based sources. However, one might object; “what’s wrong with the increase in release of Co2?”  of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide – act as a thermal blanket for the Earth, absorbing heat and warming the surface to a life-supporting average of 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius).' /gt;  Quite simply this; the sun emits ultraviolet radiation and light into the earth as energy. The earth absorbs and the re-emits some of this energy as infrared radiation back. However, greenhouse gases on the atmosphere absorb this temperature and releases it in arbitrary directions; henceforth, the earth is 33 degrees warmer than what it should have been, causing life to exist on this planet. However, this 33 degrees Celsius is the equilibrium; for it to go lower would be positive feedback, as the equilibrium could easily be restored in a short period of time, but for it to go higher would make this positive feedback and would threaten to turn our planet into a “Venus” like planet (not suitable for life). This positive feedback is more dangerous than the negative feedback, for it requires intense study of the origins of the causes. [5][6]   The causes of this release are the anthropocentric human lifestyle. To support our life, we humans have taken means to extract resources from mother nation in a Machiavellian manner. Humans are egoistic, hence the development of Capitalism and the government. From the following graph, we can see a correlation; from 1980, Co2 release sprouted and so did gas production.      If oil production is increasing, then clearly oil is also in demand; the burning of 4 liters of oil creates a shocking 8 kg of Co2. [7] 73 million kg of Co2 is henceforth released by the increase consumption of oil/diesel fuels; with these increases of Co2 emissions from fuel burning and usage alone, we can see that there is no reason to believe that humans are not causing this increase in Co2 emissions.    This graph also shows how the Industrial Revolution, in around 1840, has caused the dramatic rise of Co2 concentration. The Industrial Revolution was the basis of all industries; it revolutionized many industries and increased outputs via machinery. However, the Industrial Revolution had its basis on coal and electricity. Apart from natural gases, coal is also a huge factor in Co2 release. The usage of anthracite coal releases 920g of Co2 per kW/h, whilst the usage of lignite coal releases 990g of Co2 per kW/h. Coal is burnt for one reason only; to supply us with the electricity that runs this computer, this website, and this world. In South Africa, for example, 74% of all Co2 emissions is caused by coal burning; it would be doubtful that if humans were present, this figure would not be present. [8] As stated via the first graph of this proposition’s defense, the correlation between oil production and Co2 released is further supported by the fact that burning fuels for human usage causes the increase in the release of Co2.  Proposition Two: Deforestation  This second proposition is based upon two fundamental premises. 1. Trees absorb Co2 and release oxygen 2. Forest Fires increases Co2 release The first of these two premises is based upon the fact that trees absorb Co2 and release oxygen. This process is called photosynthesis; trees, for so long, have sustained our life through this process.     A single tree can absorb 21kg of Carbon Dioxide! That is enough to absorb the burning of 12 liters of oil! “Only if there were more trees” one would say. [9] The existence of trees means that excess Co2 could be processed and could possibly be eradicated in large amounts. However, deforestation has created a very sad and woeful dilemma for us; we are releasing more Co2 than eve, and yet we are cutting down the mechanisms that fate gave us to counter this Co2 release. It is estimated that 20% of all Co2 in the atmosphere right now would have been absorbed and would be non-existent if it weren’t for massive deforestation. [10]    The second of these premises are based upon the mere process of global warming; the warmer the temperature, the more likelihood of fires turning from small fires to huge fires. Forest fires are one of the most feared disasters in the world. Forest fires, apart from killing a plethora of citizens, can release as much Co2 as cars do. A study was released that demonstrates that in these United States of America, 290 million tones of Co2 was released due to forest fires, which is 4-6% of the entirety of Co2 released during that year. [11] Humans, due to their anthropocentric interests, have caused forest fires to appear more often due to the reckless burning of grass, wood, and other resources can cause forest fires. There is also a considerable amount of cases where forest fires started with someone carelessly dropping a cigarette on the forest grounds.    This evidence shows that humans are highly responsible for the creation of global warming; we are deferring how we absorb Co2 as well as releasing more of it. This is significant in such a manner that this issue cannot be ignored. Our planet will become Venus in the following years if this issued is not cared too.    The resolution is therefore negated. </t>

<t>4R1NRC: On Ice Ages The opponent misinterprets my argument. I have stated that hypothetically, if this were a natural cycle, then the natural cycle would have started the cooling process since 1950; however, this is not the case. Without human involvement, a decline in solar activity and increase surge of volcanic activity should have led to the decrease of earth’s temperature.  The causes of Ice Ages are not fully understood, but the scientific community has agreed on two fundamental facts; one is that greenhouse gases are causing an increase in temperature. This has in turn caused a huge melt in ice in the North and South poles; as stated, this ice loss, accordingly to the theoretical ice age predictions, should have been reversed.  The second fundamental fact that the scientific community has agreed upon is that the dinosaur release of methane was at a correct level for the world to be at a warm environment, or at least an environment worth of life. However, this methane rates are at such low rates when compared to current rates that it would be almost impossible for us to reach an Ice Age in millenniums.  Theory in this case does not correlate with actuality; theory states that humans should be experiencing a decrease in temperature, and increase in Polar Ice Levels. We are experiencing the opposite of that. As the earth’s temperature has been increasing for the last 30 years, and the Polar Ice levels are decreasing, one must understand that this change is not natural. This change can be enacted only via humans, and humans alone caused this. One must understand that for one to reach an interglacial like ours, one would need to go back 430,000 years. Our interglacial interval, called the Holocene, has been in existence for 17,000 years, yet it is experiencing conditions of interglacial periods which have been in existence for 30,000 years. Without significant human involvement, this would have been impossible. 4R2NRC: On Co2 and its effects Before we start dissecting this argument, note that the resolution here is “humans significantly affect global warming” not “humans are the cause of global warming” Although both propositions are true, and is not normally debated; the complete defense of the first proposition is enough for the opponent’s BoP to not be fulfilled. With this in mind, it can be said that Co2 causes a lot of global warming.    Fig One Take this graph for example; this graph shows the amount of Co2 present in the atmosphere, when compared with other greenhouse gasses (excluding water vapor, which shall be touched upon in my next argument). The x-axis shows the radiance, or the amount of radiation that is emitted into the surface. As we can see, the radiance of Co2 is incredibly high in radiance when compared with Carbon Oxide and Dinitrogen Monoxide. Co2 can trap an incredibly high amount of heat and emit it in all directions, more so than many other greenhouse gasses.  With this said, the high increases in Co2 will cause an increase in temperature. Apart from this, the opponent seems to object the 100% increase in the running average of temperature. From 1882, the running average is at about -0.6 degrees Celsius. In the early 2000s, that figure is at 8 degrees Celsius; during the early 1980s, this figure skyrocketed. This is due to the increase consumption of fossil fuels and many other substances, like coal, which has created a huge impact on the temperature of the earth.   This graph demonstrates the sources of human Co2 in the world; albeit one may say that us adding 29 billion g/T to the Carbon Cycle does not affect the Carbon Cycle significantly, this previous proposition can be proven false as the Carbon Cycle is only designed to absorb certain amounts of Co2 and apart from that, humans are destroying the main apparatus of Co2 absorption, which is, naturally, trees! The opponent here accuses me of talking purely about Co2, and not climate change. However, Co2 is the main cause of climate change, as proven by the above graph provided in this contention. Co2, as demonstrated in R1, is one of the most fatal gasses and could cause a huge increase of temperature. Henceforth, the increased in release of Co2 would have caused the huge increase in temperature that humans are experiencing in the last 30 years. Apart from this, one cannot simply state that historically, there has been more Co2 lurking in the atmosphere, because currently we have the most atmospheric Co2 in 800,000 years. If this is not enough, then the opponent would be satisfied in knowing that humans also release an excessive quantity of methane; albeit methane does not linger as long as Co2, its short term effects on the environment are devastating. In a measure of effectiveness in terms of trapping heat, methane traps 120 times more heat than Co2. Methane causes 25% of the current global warming crisis.   The above pie graph shows the sources of methane; as one can see, only 29% of methane releases are from natural causes. Is this not enough evidence to show that humans effectively have a significant effect on global warming? (btw cow fart also release methane) 4R3NRC: On Water Vapor Fig One shows us the radiance of several greenhouse gases excluding water vapor. Why is this? Because indeed, water vapor is the most evident greenhouse gas in the air, with twice as much concentration of water vapor in the air than Co2. Is water vapor the main cause of this crisis? Before we answer that question, two objections must be raised. “It is better safe than sorry” is a classic statement of the old. It is very illogical; perhaps even a non-sequitur, to say that water vapor is the main cause of global warming, so we should release as much Co2 as possible. As stated and demonstrated, Co2 can cause huge climate change within the area of release. Our second objection is this; if water vapor is the cause of global warming, then why are temperatures rapidly rising now? A slow increase can be understood, but a sudden increase cannot. For scientists have such an advanced knowledge that the study of geological structures (of rocks, fossils et all) can prove, quite accurately, the temperatures of the world at stages in history; with this knowledge, theoretical predictions about the earth should be satisfied. However, they are not. This cannot be because of nature, but because of anthropological causes.  With this stated, we must dissect this water vapor case. To assume that Co2 cannot have a significant effect on global warming is illogical; all greenhouse gasses cause global warming. If water vapor is the cause of global warming, then for one degrees Co2 causes to warm the planet, water vapor would cause another degree of this same temperature to rise. However, this is not the case, as Water Vapor causes one degrees Celsius of this warming, whilst Co2 causes three. Apart from this, although water vapor is the most powerful greenhouse gas, its lifetime is relatively short lived; unlike carbon, the earth’s atmosphere allows water vapor to return as substance form in the form of rain. This is done so due to the water cycle; however, the warming caused by Co2 also affects the water cycle, as the warmer the planet gets, the more water vapor is evaporated into the sky, causing a change in temperature and climate throughout the world. In conclusion, Co2 release, methane release, failures in Ice Age prophecies and the increase in release of water vapor due to the increase in anthropogenic Co2 release causes global warming. Because of these reasons, the resolution is negated. Sources: All used from last round</t>

<t>There has been no global warming for 17 years, despite a 54% increase in CO2 Pro now argues there is something wrong with NASA's Remote Sensing Satellite (RSS) data [6] because it does not measure temperature with a thermometer. No scientist, to my knowledge, has ever questioned the ability of RSS to measure temperature. Satellite measurements are far superior to the spotty coverage of weather stations subject to urban heat island effects. Satellites provide global coverage at much higher densities than attainable with in situ observations. In situ observations also suffer from non-uniform temporal coverage and undocumented changes in the instrumentation used that can lead to local biases and increased uncertainty. … Satellites can measure the temperature of the atmosphere by evaluating thermal emission from gases in the atmosphere. ... By choosing the different measurement frequencies, and thus different values of absorptivity, the emission from different layers of the atmosphere can be measured. RSS studies the measurements made by 3 series of satellite-borne microwave sounders in order to construct long-term, climate-quality atmospheric temperature datasets for use by the scientific community.  [24. http://www.remss.com...] If temperature continued to climb in the past 17 years, we would expect advocates of the theory of CO2 dominated climate to trumpet the success of climate models. But those advocates recognize the fact that the models have failed, the Voosen article I cited makes it clear that CO2 advocates are struggling for an explanation of why the models have failed. I explained in detail why there is no inconsistency with having no temperature increase in 17 years and having the 2001-2010 decade averaging warmer than the 90s. Pro ignored my explanation and claimed that there is a conflict. Pro said I claimed that the temperature anomaly was reset for each decade. That's nonsense, I made no such claim, and if it were reset every decade then the temperature anomalies would be a string of zeros. The anomaly is an arbitrary offset to prevent graphs from having to be scaled with the average global temperature of around 59 degrees F or 287 degrees Kelvin. Pro's graph shows global warming to have stopped since 2000. In additional to providing the actual data and the opinions of scientists who advocate CO2-dominated climate, I provided the work of Von Storch and separately of Mauritsen who showed that CO2 models could not explain the pause. [7] Pro claims I misrepresented Von Storch because in 2006 Von Storch said he believed CO2 dominates climate, but in 2012 Von Storch admitted the CO2 models failed. I quoted Von Storch as saying “we find that the continued stagnation in global warming, from 1998 to 2012, is inconsistent with model predictions, even at the 2% confidence level.” [17] That's not a misrepresentation. Scientists become convinced by unrelenting contrary data. The same is true of other CO2 advocates, quoted by Voosen [20], who finally have given up trying to defend the models. I cited Tinsdale's book [7] for it's extensive comparisons showing the CO2 models fail. Pro argues that I needed to have shown and argued every piece of evidence in the book. No, all I needed to do was to make a claim and cite the evidence. To refute Tinsdale, Pro might have cited some contrary compendium showing all the models were on target, but there is no such evidence to be cited. Some of the CO2 advocates claim the lack of global warming is due to something other than cosmic ray clouds seeding. Hansen supposes it might be reflective soot from coal burning in China. For the present debate, it suffices to say that CO2 is not dominating climate, and so until the science is resolved future predictions cannot be made reliability under the assumption that CO2 dominates. Cosmic ray effects, or something else associated with sunspots, are clearly the most likely factor because the sunspot trend since the early 1800s has been generally in favor of warming, but sunspots activity also tracks the Medieval Warm Period, the Little Ice Age, the global warming pause from the 40s through the 70s, the 70s sharp cooling, and the current 17 year lack of global warming. All this was shown clearly in the data presented in the debate.Current models do not include all the natural forcings  Pro's graphs of temperature with and without CO2 are purely math model predictions. He says that they include sunspot and ocean oscillation effects, but they unquestionably do not. That's apparent because the real temperatures post 2000 did not rise as the graphs show, and also because the projections go out into the future. Voosen [20] specifically referenced these elements missing from the models. The “natural forcings” in the model projections are defective because they do not include the cosmic ray and magnetic effects of sunspots, rather only the inconsequential changes in irradiance. Pro began by arguing that that we should not look at temperatures before 1900, because that's when anthropogenic global warming began. However, the physics of climate do not change, and temperature reconstructions on scales of millions of years, hundreds of thousands of years, and the past 2000 years show that CO2 has never dominated climate, no matter what the source of CO2. CO2 levels have been many times current levels. In the past, CO2 increase was a product of warming, not a cause. CO2 may increase warming slightly, but it's never prevented natural forcings from driving temperatures down. To show that CO2 now dominates climate, advocates must show that no other natural factors are significant, but current lack of warming shows that the models are dead wrong. In this round Pro introduced the argument that CO2-induced warming began in the 1800s. But then what caused the preceding Medieval Warm Period and Little Age? It's far more likely that whatever caused those major climate changes ended, producing the subsequent warming. Those major climate events were tightly correlated with sunspot activity. To argue it was CO2, a switch must have been flipped around 1825 causing sunspots to no longer have an effect and CO2 to start dominating. Polar sea ice has increased to a current high, contrary to CO2 theoryPro began by claiming that the decrease in Arctic Ice proved that CO2 causes global warming. That claim evaporated in the light of evidence that Arctic ice has been disappearing and reappearing for centuries with the cycle of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which is not in the CO2 climate models. Also, CO2 warming does not explain why Antarctic ice has increased so much so that total ice has had a net increase. Pro shifted to arguing that total accumulated ice on earth has been decreasing since the end of the Little Age, but that is better explained by sunspot activity than CO2. No one claims the Little Age was due to a sudden CO2 shortage.Future CO2 levels are unpredictable. Pro offered only unsupported assertions to counter cited expert opinion that we are rapidly running out of fossil fuels, and technology will provide substitutes. The sun, not CO2, dominates climate  We are seeing the real world destroy the theory of CO2 dominating climate. The CO2 math models cannot be tuned to explain how a 54% increase in CO2 has failed to produce and increase in global temperatures. For a while, the notion was that the failure was some transient glitch that would quickly disappear. After 17 years, it's clear that there is a fundamental lack of understanding reflected in climate models. CO2 theorists have been fervent in clinging to their theory, but they are nonetheless still scientists and ultimately obliged to yield their theory to the contrary data. I'm sure that science will ultimately succeed in getting climate models that match reality, and that the models will include some effect of CO2. But it should not be a surprise that the sun dominates climate, even though we are still figuring out exactly how.</t>

My opponent has not shown how his arguments are relevant, as he hasn't addressed my arguments as to how they aren't relevant. Also, from the resolution and the arguments you have put forth, you have been arguing that humans have been a significant, if not the main cause of the modern global warming. I've been showing how they're not.  Refutations  Climate Models  Climate models are far from perfect. In fact, they have consistently overestimated warming. 'The computer models predict that the 20th century temperatures should have increased by 1.6 to 3.74 Celsius, while the actual observed 20th-century temperature increase was about 0.6 Celsius. A model that fails to history match is useless for predicting the future.'[1]  Here is a graph showing various climate model predictions to actual temperatures:    'The IPCC models projected the global 17-year SST trend ending August 2011 at 0.15 C/decade, but the observed rise was only 0.02 C/decade... The quoted error on a single measurement is 0.05 C. The probability that the IPCC projections overstate the warming in greater than 90%.' I could go on more about this, but since my opponent has provided no proof of the validity of climate models, this will suffice.[1]  To conclude, here is a prediction made by a climate model:  Built in cooling trend until at least 2024 Temperature Hadsst3 moving average anomaly 2035 - 0.15 Temperature Hadsst3 moving average anomaly 2100 ' 0.5 General Conclusion ' by 2100 all the 20th century temperature rise will have been reversed.[2]  Why should we believe the models that predict excessive warming instead of models that predict a decrease in temperatures.  Water Vapor Feedback  Once again, the predictions to not match up with the observations. The feedback predicts relative humidity to remain constant so that the atmosphere can hold more water vapor with increased temperatures. However, humidity has actually fallen. This doesn't only negate the supposed positive feedback, but if the decrease is large enough, it may actually become a negative feedback.  Here is a graph showing relative humidity over the last 60 years:    'This shows that the actual water vapor content in the upper troposphere has declined by 13.7% (best fit line) from 1948 to 2012 at the 400 mb pressure level. The climate models predict that humidity will increase in the upper troposphere, but the data shows a large decrease; just where water vapor changes have the greatest effect on global temperatures.'[1]  Ocean Acidification  Actually, claims of ocean acidification have been greatly exaggerated and misinterpreted. The mean drop in pH levels as a result of CO2 increases is around 0.3, but the sea can experience changes of almost 1.4 in as little as just a day. 'On a monthly scale the pH varies by 0.024 to 1.430 pH units.''At Puerto Morelos (in Mexico's easternmost state, on the Yucat'n Peninsula) the pH varied as much as 0.3 units per hour due to groundwater springs.''Even the more stable and vast open ocean is not a fixed pH all year round. Hofmann writes that 'Open-water areas (in the Southern Ocean) experience a strong seasonal shift in seawater pH (~0.3'0.5 units) between austral summer and winter.''[3][4]  This is the paper's hypothesis: 'This natural variability has prompted the suggestion that an appropriate null hypothesis may be, until evidence is obtained to the contrary, that major biogeochemical processes in the oceans other than calcification will not be fundamentally different under future higher CO2/lower pH conditions'[3][4]  The Consensus  This argument has employed by pro in both his first argument as an argument, and in this round to support his position. However, both instances commit both a fallacy and a gross inaccuracy.  First, the fallacy. Science does not work by consensus. The number of researchers or organizations has little bearing on whether what they believe is actually true. Michael Crichton has said, 'Consensus is the business of politics. Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world. In science consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus.' My opponent has said that petroleum companies supporting climate change deniers is a conflict of interest, but so are governmental organizations, because legislators want them to provide information that will support the legislation will support. Politics in science hardly makes for objective conclusions.[1]  Even so, the consensus doesn't even exist in the first place. Over 31,000 scientists (with at least a Bachelors' degree in relevant fields) have signed a petition saying that global warming is not anthropogenic. The Heartland Institute has conducted an international survey of 530 climate scientists in 2003. The survey asked if the current state of scientific knowledge is developed well enough to allow for a reasonable assessment of the effects of greenhouse gases. Two-thirds of the scientists surveyed (65.9 percent) disagreed with the statement, with nearly half (45.7 percent) scoring it with a 1 or 2, indicating strong disagreement. Only 10.9 percent scored it with a 6 or 7, indicating strong agreement. Most of the organizations my opponent lists are governmental, meaning that they have that conflict of interest I mentioned earlier.[5][6]  The graphs my opponent provides are either irrelevant, are refuted by my argument against the consensus above, or show a rough correlation between CO2 and temperature that I have already shown to not exist. It is also relevant to note that the r^2 correlation between CO2 and temperature over the last century is only 0.44, which is considered poor.[7]  Also, as for the other greenhouse gases, my opponent has not argued for them specifically, concentrating on CO2 in his arguments. Regardless, I will simply refer to my fourth argument in the last round on greenhouse gas absorption. Methane has an absorption band (at 8 micrometres) that largely overlaps with water vapor, so an increase in methane has little effect on temperature. In addition to methane, the wavelengths of light that nitrous oxide absorb largely overlap with that of water vapor, so an increase in nitrous oxide also has little effect on temperature. Those are the main greenhouse gases. I will address these more if my opponent considers them any more than he has.[1]  Conclusion  My opponent's entire argument in this round is a fallacious attempt to make his position seem valid when he can't refute the arguments I made in the first round. Again, science does not work by consensus, and even so, there really is no 'consensus'. Pro has never gotten near satisfying his BoP that humans are causing climate change.</t>

<t>I do not deny that there has been an increase of temperatures since the mid 1800’s, nor will I deny that CO2 emissions have increased over the same period. What I do take an  issue with is the claim that the increase of CO2 emissions is the cause of the warming in the last 100 or so years.   1. Climate sensitivity   The direct effect of CO2 on warming has been demonstrated in laboratories time and time again. The fact is, the greenhouse effect is real and that an increase in CO2 will lead to some warming, the question still remains: how much.   The direct effect from CO2 is not significant. CO2, which has a logarithmic warming effect, becomes less potent per each molecule of CO2 emitted each molecule that is created. All in all, the direct effect of CO2 leads to insignificant warming amounts. AGW proponents claim that there are positive feedbacks--i.e. amplifiers. The small added warming from the CO2 causes a chain of reactions and the warming increases exponentially, causing a runaway greenhouse effect. Generally, alarmists claim that doubling CO2 with the added effects lead to about 3.3 degrees C of warming, whereas skeptics claim it will be much less: with some estimates around 1 degree C, others at 0.5-0.6 degrees C [1]. If alarmists are correct, CO2 likely caused the majority of the 20th century warming. If skeptics are correct, CO2 has played a negligible role in the recent warming and will continue to play a negligible role in the future.   Now, what does the data argue on this issue? Alarmists base their predictions on climate models. Climate models model temperature based on data that climate modelers--who are not always scientists--put inside the computer. The issue is that this method of data is flawed. How do we get these alarmist predictions? A lot of climate models exist. They all meet together--all the modelers--to compare their data. Some models produce little warming, others produce a lot. They then claim the real answer is in between, they choose one of the middle answers. However, this may not be the correct answer. The fact is, the answer could be any of the models, or none of them at all, however they merely claim it must me the middle answer, which as you can see, is a flawed approach to such a complex system.   The above statements can be evidenced by a simple fact: the models are wrong. The vast majority of models produce too much sensitivity, and the average ‘middle ground’ is significantly above observed temperatures [2]. There is significant scientific evidence published in the peer reviewed academic research that argues the sensitivity predicted by the alarmists is incorrect, and that we should expect minimal warming from doubling of CO2 emissions [3].   2. Climate predictions have been wrong for the last decade  A theory is as good as its predictions. You make a hypothesis, predict what you think is going to happen, and compare the actual data. If your predictions are off, you need to change the hypothesis. The fact is, AGW predictions have been off and need to be corrected to claim the effect of humans is much smaller than once thought.   Warming in the last decade has been far below the expected temperature increase. There has been either no warming, or even cooling [4]. During this period, the IPCC high, low, and ‘best’ estimate all were higher than what was observed. Using AGW theory, this was not predictable. However, believing that oceanic cycles [5], or the sun [6], caused significant warming in the last 100 years, this change in temperature is wholly reasonable. Therefore, at least for the last decade, the natural causes of climate change correlate better than the anthropogenic ones.   Another very important prediction is the existence of a tropospheric hotspot. Models significantly overestimate the tropospheric hotspot. When you look at the actual data, there has been minimal warming in the troposphere [8]. Further, on nearly every altitude, the actual data show the atmosphere significantly cooler than predicted [12].   3. Possible Natural Causes  The natural cause I will be supporting in this debate is the solar cause. The sun causing climate change makes sense: it is the sole source of heat on this planet, the other sources have either unknown causes or merely amplify the suns effect. The sun, however, directly and indirectly causes climate change.   The length of the solar cycle has been correlated to temperature throughout the 20th century. Direct sunlight, cosmic rays, magnetic fields, short and long term solar cycles, all easily explain--and contribute--to climate change [7]. As geologist Bob Carter notes, “the argument advanced by the IPCC… [that] the sun cannot play a major role in global warming or cooling trends--is incorrect.”[8] Recent research by Willie Soon and David Legates, using new and improved TSI (total solar irradiance) measuring techniques definitively conclude that the sun causes the majority of recent climate change. Further, they correct their previous research, and answer the ‘missing link’ question which was formulated in Soon, 2009. Their conclusion states that there exists strong evidence of a solar to climate relationship, and argues that models need to include the possibility of a strong solar forcing [9]. A summary of recent research argues that “[t]he Sun may have contributed as much as 66% of  the observed twentieth century warming, and perhaps more. … IPCC models do not incorporate important solar  factors such as fluctuations in magnetic intensity  and overestimate the role of human-related CO2 forcing.”[10]  However, I have mainly been talking about TSI, which does cause a significant amount of climate change. Other, more indirect, sources of energy from the sun do cause climate change. The most well known of these is the cosmic ray hypothesis. Cosmic rays cause climate change through cloud formation. How do cosmic rays cause cloud formation?  Cosmic rays come in from outer space. TSI alone cannot explain warming throughout all of history, it is commonly accepted that it needs a modifier, so, how do cosmic rays modify the sun’s rays? As these rays hit earth, they are something which molecules use to create clouds. The correlation between cloud formation and cosmic rays is clear. The more cosmic rays, the more clouds, clouds as a negative feedback cool the earth, therefore more cosmic rays = cooler earth. The fewer cosmic rays, the fewer clouds, and a warmer earth. So, lets examine this theory. As the sun is more active, a stronger solar wind exists and pushes the rays away, reducing the amount of cosmic rays--a warmer earth. As the sun cools down, the less wind, a cooler earth. Let’s examine this theory [11]:  1) Cosmic rays cause cloud formation: Significant evidence exists of the cosmic ray-cloud formation link. According to research in the early 21st century, there exists a close correlation between cosmic rays and cloud formation. The more rays, the more clouds. Cosmic rays, therefore, are related to cloud formation.  2) Cosmic ray-temperature correlation: On a geologic timescale, there is a very strong correlation between cosmic rays and temperature. During the phanerozoic, there exists a near perfect correlation between cosmic rays and temperature.   3) Clouds serve as a negative feedback: Clouds need to be a negative feedback in order for this theory to be strong. The data on sensitivity above already agree with this assertion. Clouds, which is one of the largest feedbacks, is primarily negative.   So, to summarize, cosmic rays cause cloud formation, cosmic rays correlate to temperature, clouds have decreased, clouds are a negative feedback which means more cosmic rays cool the earth, and fewer warm it. Cosmic rays are a viable candidate in the search for a cause for climate change.   Conclusion:  Based on the failure to predict phenomena, low climate sensitivity making it nearly impossible for CO2 to have a significant warming effect, and strong evidence for a solar link contributing to the majority of recent warming, I see it unlikely that AGW theory is correct. Climate change happens, whether we want it to or not. The climate is changing, and humans are affecting it, but our influence is negligible when compared to strong natural factors. </t>

<t>Outline: With most of Pro's argument based off the effect of CO2, I simply have to show that CO2 has a minor effect on Global Warming. I already have the historical data to prove it.Rebuttal I: Importance of CO2Pro brings up Climate Sensitivity. It's a common and exaggerated argument. The GWP measures how sensitive the Climate is to that element. 1 Gigaton of vapor has far less than the effect on the climate of half a Gigaton of CO2. Climate Sensitivity has already been addressed as soon as GWP was brought into the discussion. That being said, with a GWP of 1, not much is happening to the climate...My argument about the Cambrian Era emphasizes this. At 7000 ppm, The climate was only 10ºc. If the climate was as sensitive to CO2 as Pro claims, the Cambrian Era would have been 50ºc higher or more, and literally unsurvivable for the Dinosaurs living during it. If climate was as fragile as Pro claims, we would be in, by far, the hottest warming period in the last 400,000 year, not the coldest. Those two things are issues Pro's argument simply disreguards.A) Climate SensitiveClimate Sensitivity is hardly as intense as Pro claims. If you view my charts in R3, you will again see that CO2 is 25% higher than any other period, but the temperature hasn't followed. Why? Because CO2 doesn't have a large effect on temperature. I've already done the math in R2 showing that the increase in CO2 only accounts for 0.15°F of the total increase in temperature, which says a lot, since the total increase in temperature still leaves us freezing in comparison to other warming periods.The claim about the potention effect CO2 has and what the actual data say just aren't agreeing. Climate Sensitivity would have took effect in the Cambrian era as well, and let the tempature was well under what Pro needs to back his case.B) Man-Made CO2Much of Pro's argument is based on how much CO2 human's release... Which I've already brought up. We do tip the pot, I've said this... And we did increase the amount of CO2 in the air, I've said this... And yet the data STILL says it's doing little to nothing. Why? Because, again, CO2 is weak. The amount we release simply isn't doing anything. Again looking at my math in R2, the total increase in CO2 has had an affect of 0.15°F.Pro is arguing in circles. 'CO2 is increasing' 'The increase is doing nothing' 'But the CO2 is increasing.' Pro is simply arguing in circles, repeating his last round. We already brought up the increase in CO2, I already explained the insignificance of the increase... I even brought up how much we added... In fact, my numbers were higher than Pro's (35 Gigatons to Pro's 29 Gigatons). The increase in CO2 has been recorded, and the increase in temperature has been recording, and the correlation is small and unsupportive of Pro's case.Pro is chasing his tail, and begging the question. Claiming the increase in CO2 is bad because we are increasing CO2, ignoring every argument made showing how little of an affect that increase actually has. Pro is showing how much it's increasing, but as let to show the affect of that increase. I have shown the affect of that increase, and it is minor.Rebuttal II: Indirect EmissionsIt should be mentioned that Indirect Emissions aren't ignored when measuring PPM. The 400 ppm still includes those. That being said, Indirect Emissions have already been calculated, and do not hold some potential that was overlooked in the chart's I've shown. The increase in CO2 from Indirect Emissions isn't hidden. We see it just like we see any other. They were already accounted for.A) Tree Replanting.My math, in regards to CO2 consumption, is based on an average rate. Not the rate at which new trees consume CO2. Even if the amount consumed was much smaller, it doesn't say much against how wide the gap was. 661.17 Gigatons consumed compared to 237.6 Gigatons made. The total consumption rate by the end of 88 years would have to be cut down by 63%. Odds are, the decrease in CO2 consumption will likely never be that extreme. The gap in Consumption and Emissions is simply too large. If cut in half, the Consumption would be widely above Emission.B) Ocean and HeatingThis argument is flawed in that it ignores just how small the temperature increase from man-made emissions is. As explained, human emissions (all emission, Methane, Nitrous, and F Gases included) is responsible for an increase of 0.20°F, the rest being natural. Pro gravely exaggerates the affect of CO2 on the ocean's ability to absorb CO2. If it was as sensitive as he claims, once the extremely hot Summer season hits the ocean, it would never end. Also the increase needed, being several degrees Celsius, as Pro mentions, is far from the current increase. Assume it takes 4°c... It would take 666 years to reach that, as it took 134 years to see temperature increase by 0.85°c. This is a causational paradox. Claiming that Global Warming is causing X to create Global Warming. What's causing the temperature to rise? The Ocean's efficency going down. What's causing it to go down? The rising temperature that it was causing. Claiming that X, caused by Y, is causing Y to cause X in the first place. As well, all pro is doing is listing off new ways CO2 is building up. My data includes TOTAL ppm, including direct and indirect. That 400 ppm we are taking about doesn't somehow exclude CO2 from the ocean. For EVERY way pro claims CO2 is raising, it still doesn't prove CO2 is influential enough to be a threat, while my data shows it isn't.Final Defense:CO2 just doesn't have the needed impact to claim human's are responsible for most of Global Warming. The Cambrian Era and the past 400,000 years went unchallenged. Every variable Pro brought up would have effected temperatures in the past as well, and yet the temperature in the Cambrian era was well under what it'd have to be for Pro's claim to be true.As the data shows, the Cambrian Era (550 mya to 480 mya) was nearly 8°c above today, despite having 17x the CO2. This chart, like all my other charts, takes into account the whole temperature as it is/was. Every variable and hidden factor that Pro brings in is accounted for. If it's not, that's because the variable literally didn't effect the temperature. The temperature doesn't exclude increases from the decrease in CO2 consumption in the Ocean, if that increases temperature, we'll see it on the chart. With every variable took into effect, temperature to CO2 ratio just doesn't add up to Pro's claim. If CO2 was as capable of the kind of Global Warming Pro claims, directly and indirectly, temperatures in the Cambrian era, and today, would be much higher. Pro acts as though every variable he brought up doesn't show up on my charts, as though they only now exist. They have been involved the whole time. The temperature has increased 1.5°F, that increase is already caused by every variable Pro mentioned, and yet it's still leaves us with the coldest warming period in the last 400,000 years, and my math (using the GWP of thg gases) only makes up a small portion of that increase. To small of an increase to snowball out control. If an increase of 0.20°F is enough to cause what Pro claims, Summer would be devastating.All of Pro's arguments simply ignores the data.As seen in my charts, CO2 rises with temperature, but isn't causing (most) of the temperature increase. The argument is Post Hoc. CO2 may rise with tempature, but it doesn't cause the temperature. If it did, the Cambrian era would e 4-5x hotter, and we'd be at least 6x hotter. History simply shows that CO2 isn't strong enough to have a major impact on tempature.1) http://www.geocraft.com...Conclusion: Men-made Global Warming doesn't make up a large part of the Global Warming cycle, and isn't a threat.CO2's effect is small, as has been seen long ago and today. In order for Pro's arguments to be accurate and right, temperatures today must be well above all the temperatures of the last 400,000 years. The fact that temperatures have barely risen with CO2 shows the minimal impact CO2 has on it.Pro's arguments are begging the question. He claims CO2 level raising are an issue because we are increasing CO2, ignoring that data, and GWP of CO2, deems the increase near harmless.CO2 simply does not bare to Global Warming Impact needed to prove Pro's case. Human's are not responsible for most the temperature increase, and our influence simply isn't a threat to humanity.</t>

<t>Thanks for accepting this debate I hope we have a great debate! Evidence is only to be presented when asked for Last speeches, no new evidence is to be presented 1st speech- opening 2nd- rebuttals 3rd- more rebuttals 4th- summary 5th- Closing statement Good luck! PRO- Case Definitions  First, we offer the CIA World Factbook's definition of 'developed countries,' which includes just over thirty nations that are generally first-world and feature service-oriented economies.  Standard- The standard of today's debate, or weighing mechanism, should be deontology. Since this topic is about moral obligations and deontology is about the morality of actions and its justification, we believe that the team that adheres to this standard should win this debate.  1. Alternative- Adaptation Adapting is the correct way to go in the process of mitigating. Since today's topic is about mitigating the effects of climate change, and not mitigating climate change, as the affirmative team, it is our ground to be able to 'adapt' to the effects of climate change.  According to epa.gov, some of the effects of climate change are that heavy rainfall or flooding can increase water-borne parasites that are sometimes found in drinking water. These parasites can cause, in severe cases, death. One instance to mitigating the effects of climate change includes vaccinating, which is cheap and extremely effective. According to givewell.org, it costs only $14 to vaccinate a child, and The UNICEF states that 9 million lives are saved from vaccines annually.  The impact is clear. It would be better to adapt to the effects of climate change. One of the effects is disease, and if we can save all these people from disease by administering vaccines, for a small price of $14 per child, we should win this debate. 2. Economy If developed countries mitigate the effects of climate change, the economy will grow. According to the UN, Renewable energy generates more jobs than fossil fuels. Worldwide, jobs in renewable energy industries exceeded 35 million in 2010. $211 billion were invested in the renewable industries in 2010. Obviously, the renewable energy industries create a bigger impact than fossil fuels, and are capable to generate more jobs in the future than fossil fuel industries will be able to.  A study done by the Natural Resource Defense Council said that if present trends continue, these four global warming impacts alone will come with a price tag of almost 1.9 trillion annually (in today's dollars), by 2100.  The Impact is that Mitigating the effects of climate change is important because of how much it is costing the world. With more jobs being created, the economy is being reboosted. Obviously countries have a moral obligation if climate change is costing them money. 3. Moral Obligation Developed countries have the obligation to fix the mess that they created. After all, it is the developed country's fault, and they should fix it. The United states is making nearly 5,500 million tonnes CO2 emissions (Guardian). Developed Countries should also have the moral obligation to not contribute to campaigns that kill human beings. For example, terrorism:  It is oil money that enables Saudi Arabia [and many other countries] to invest approximately 40% of its income on weapons procurement. In July 2005 undersecretary of the Treasury, Stuart Levey, testifying in the Senate noted 'Wealthy Saudi financiers and charities have funded terrorist organizations and causes that support terrorism and the ideology that fuels the terrorists' agenda. Even today, we believe that Saudi donors may still be a significant source of terrorist financing.' - Institute for the Analysis of Global security. Over 12,000 people were killed by terrorist attacks in 2011- according to the National Counter Terrorism Center  Judge, what this means is that many patrons of terrorism happen to be oil and gasoline investors. If we buy gasoline, these supporters of terrorism would earn money, and stuff their profits into supporting terrorist groups, leading to deaths inside our own country and other places around the world. But if we switch to green energy, we would significantly decrease the profits of these terrorism supporters, and as a result, save many lives.  The Impact is clear. Countries have the moral obligation to solve the problems that they have created, and also to try and save the lives of their own citizens from acts like terrorism, by trying to mitigate the effects of climate change.  4. The Environment Climate Change causes the environment to be affected. All the more reason for countries to mitigate its effects. According to Nasa, Approximately 20-30% of plant and animal species are likely to be at increased risk of extinction if increases in global average temperature exceeds 1.5-2.5'C.  We need to get prepared for four degrees of global warming, Bob Watson [PhD in Chemistry, Award for Scientific Freedom and Responsibility] told the Guardian last month.Weather would become extreme and unpredictable, with more frequent and severe droughts, floods and hurricanes. The Earth's carrying capacity would be hugely reduced. Billions would undoubtedly die.  The Impact is that if the Earth's temperatures rises just the slightest amount, millions might die! We must mitigate these effects before it is too late.</t>

<t>RE: I forgot to say first round acceptance—that is my fault. I ask my opponent simply doesn’t post rebuttals last round, but he can summarize his arguments. Instead of a rebuttal I will simply write my case. Please note that I didn't make an argument in Round1. Rather I made an appeal for a more complete, less biased definition of the term 'hockey stick' and offered Wikipedia as an objective source. So far, this request has been ignored. I will make my argument in Round2, same as Con. I will refrain from rebuttals in Round4 on the condition Con does likewise. THESIS: The mean surface temperature of the Earth has risen by 0.74±0.18 °C over the period 1906–2012. Two-thirds of that increase (.6C/1F) has occurred since 1980. This peak represents both the highest global temperature of the past 1000 years and the most rapid escalation. As a kind of shorthand, some scientists refer to the graphed geometry of this peak as a 'hockey stick' to evoke a rapid rise after a sustained period of less dramatic change. To the limited degree by which the image of a hockey stick can approximate well-established recent changes in climate, the Hockey Stick is likely correct.Science is not in the business of asserting truths about our world. Rather, the process of science is to offer theories, create experiments to test those theories, analyze and publish results, offer alternative theories that might falsify results.  Theories are then adjusted in response to critique, new experiments are created to test, and so on. The scientific method is a conversation, a continuously refocused and improved loop. To the extent that experimental results are repeatable and reliable, those theories are accorded increasing degrees of certainty. One example of a theory that has acquired a very high degree of confidence in the scientific community is the assertion that the last few decades have been the warmest of the millennium in terms of global mean surface temperature. Sometimes referred to as the 'Hockey Stick Graph' as a way of describing the short, sharp rise in temperature, data supporting this theory goes back at least to Jacoby amp; D'Arrigo 1989 [1] but received an increased degree of public attention after the release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Third Assessment Report in 2001, [2] which included a preliminary version of a Hockey Stick Graph reproducing the work of Mann, et al 1999 (MBH99). [3]What was MBH99? MBH99 was a study of 12 paleoclimatic indicators that illustrated a global pattern of annual surface temperature rise, demonstrating that temperatures over the previous decade were the highest of the millennium.What is the IPCC? The IPCC is a scientific body set up by the World Meteorological Organization and the UN in 1988 to provide comprehensive scientific assessments of current scientific information worldwide about the risk of climate change. Representing the consensus of 2500 unpaid leaders in the scientific community and 100 participating national governments, the IPCC is the single largest collective international scientific effort in history. The IPCC was awarded the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize 'for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change.' This is not to make an argument from authority or to pretend that IPCC findings are unimpeachable. However, if one wishes a careful and comprehensive summary of the scientific consensus, the IPCC is unmatched in the study of climate change, or indeed, by any other field of scientific study. Here is the IPCC Hockey Stick in 2001:Following the public attention given to the IPCC publication of the MBH99, there has more than a decade of reaction and response, including those studies provided by Con in his arguments. Many, many studies have expanded upon and, to a remarkable degree, supported the MBH99 Hockey Stick. When the IPCC released its Fourth Assessment Report in 2007, that body offered the following summary:'Paleoclimatic information supports the interpretation that the warmth of the last half century is unusual in at least the previous 1,300 years. The last time the polar regions were significantly warmer than present for an extended period (about 125,000 years ago), reductions in polar ice volume led to 4 to 6 m of sea level rise. Average Northern Hemisphere temperatures during the second half of the 20th century were very likely higher than during any other 50-year period in the last 500 years and likely the highest in at least the past 1,300 years. ' [4]We should note here that the AR4 assigns a probability to likely as greater than 66%.'the following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood, using expert judgement, of an outcome or a result: Virtually certain gt; 99% probability of occurrence, Extremely likely gt; 95%, Very likely gt; 90%, Likely gt; 66%, More likely than not gt; 50%, Unlikely lt; 33%, Very unlikely lt; 10%, Extremely unlikely lt; 5% ' [4]That is, the single most significant survey of scientific opinion up to 2007 asserted a 2:1 probability that the Hockey Stick was correct. To support these findings, the IPCC listed the following studies:  Jones et al. (1998), calibrated by Jones, Osborn amp; Briffa 2001 'The Evolution of Climate Over the Last Millennium' Briffa (2000), calibrated by Briffa, Osborn amp; Schweingruber 2004 'Large-scale temperature inferences from tree rings: a review' Crowley amp; Lowery 2000 'How Warm Was the Medieval Warm Period?' Briffa et al. 2001 'Low-frequency temperature variations from a northern tree ring density network' Esper, Cook amp; Schweingruber 2002 'Low-Frequency Signals in Long Tree-Ring Chronologies for Reconstructing Past Temperature Variability' Mann amp; Jones 2003 'Global surface temperatures over the past two millennia' Pollack amp; Smerdon 2004 'Borehole climate reconstructions: Spatial structure and hemispheric averages' Oerlemans 2005 'Extracting a climate signal from 169 glacier records' Rutherford et al. 2005 'Proxy-based Northern Hemisphere surface temperature reconstructions: Sensitivity to method, predictor network, target season, and target domain' Moberg et al. 2005 'Highly variable Northern Hemisphere temperatures reconstructed from low- and high-resolution proxy data' D'Arrigo, Wilson amp; Jacoby 2006 'On the long-term context for late twentieth century warming' Osborn amp; Briffa 2006 'The spatial extent of 20th-century warmth in the context of the past 1200 years' Hegerl et al. 2006 'Climate sensitivity constrained by temperature reconstructions over the past seven centuries'  And here those studies are graphed against MBH99:So we can see that most reconstructions since MBH have found the Medieval Warm Period to be even cooler than MBH99. None of these studies found that the MWP rivaled the last two decades for mean temperature increases.Since IPCC AR4 in 2007, there have been many more studies using increasingly large sampling sizes from increasingly disparate paleoclimatic indicators and geographies and going even further back in time. The more often the experiment is repeated, the more evident and less deniable the hockey stick becomes:  Smith et al. 2006 'Reconstructing hemispheric-scale climates from multiple stalagmite records'.

Marcott et al. 2013 'A Reconstruction of Regional and Global Temperature for the Past 11,300 Years' Ahmed et al. 2013 (PAGES 2k Consortium) 'Continental-scale temperature variability during the past two millennia'  As I stated in Round1 that last study, the PAGES 2K Consortium is the single most comprehensive study to date including 511 paleoclimatic indicators from around the world (see the map in Round1 and the graph substantiating MBH99).Here is Marcott's 2013 Hockey Stick compared to MBH99:CONCLUSION: Our confidence in any scientific proposition increases as experiments are reliably repeated with the same results. Since MBH99 and the IPCC Third Assessment, the theory that current global warming is unprecedented for at least a millennium has been supported by repeated, rigorous experimentation. To the degree that the IPCC represents the cautious consensus of Climate Change expertise and those experts have assigned a 66% probability to the data illustrated by the Hockey Stick Graph, the Hockey Stick is likely (greater than Con's defined 50%) correct.I'll offer rebuttals to Con's argument in Round 3.</t>

Arbor states, http://www.treesaregood.com... We like trees around us because they make life more pleasant. Most of us respond to the presence of trees beyond simply observing their beauty. We feel serene, peaceful, restful, and tranquil in a grove of trees. We are 'at home' there. Hospital patients have been shown to recover from surgery more quickly when their hospital room offered a view of trees. The strong ties between people and trees are most evident in the resistance of community residents to removing trees to widen streets. Or we note the heroic efforts of individuals and organizations to save particularly large or historic trees in a community. The stature, strength, and endurance of trees give them a cathedral-like quality. Because of their potential for long life, trees frequently are planted as living memorials. We often become personally attached to trees that we or those we love have planted. This means that trees make us feel at peace during our time on earth and help us with particular things such as recovering from surgery. Trees are like to us our mothers when we were young and were sick.  Arbor 2,  Trees alter the environment in which we live by moderating climate, improving air quality, conserving water, and harboring wildlife. Climate control is obtained by moderating the effects of sun, wind, and rain. Radiant energy from the sun is absorbed or deflected by leaves on deciduous trees in the summer and is only filtered by branches of deciduous trees in winter. We are cooler when we stand in the shade of trees and are not exposed to direct sunlight. In winter, we value the sun's radiant energy. Therefore, we should plant only small or deciduous trees on the south side of homes. Wind speed and direction can be affected by trees. The more compact the foliage on the tree or group of trees, the greater the influence of the windbreak. The downward fall of rain, sleet, and hail is initially absorbed or deflected by trees, which provides some protection for people, pets, and buildings. Trees intercept water, store some of it, and reduce storm runoff and the possibility of flooding. Dew and frost are less common under trees because less radiant energy is released from the soil in those areas at night. Temperature in the vicinity of trees is cooler than that away from trees. The larger the tree, the greater the cooling. By using trees in the cities, we are able to moderate the heat-island effect caused by pavement and buildings in commercial areas. Air quality can be improved through the use of trees, shrubs, and turf. Leaves filter the air we breathe by removing dust and other particulates. Rain then washes the pollutants to the ground. Leaves absorb carbon dioxide from the air to form carbohydrates that are used in the plant's structure and function. In this process, leaves also absorb other air pollutants'such as ozone, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide'and give off oxygen. By planting trees and shrubs, we return to a more natural, less artificial environment. Birds and other wildlife are attracted to the area. The natural cycles of plant growth, reproduction, and decomposition are again present, both above and below ground. Natural harmony is restored to the urban environment. This means that trees offer many positive benefits to humans.  Epstein, http://www.scienceinpublic.com.au... Life on Earth depends on plants, algae and fungi. For humanity, all seven billion of us, they are the major source of food, clothing, shelter and medicine. Our fossil fuels were formed by them. They clean our air and water, store carbon, and protect us from floods and drought. This shows that humans cannot survive without the plants that make up our environment. Even drastically changing the amount of trees and plants that make up our environment can be fatal.  Marine Conservation Institute,  Because the oceans are the largest ecosystems on Earth, they are the Earth's largest life support systems. To survive and prosper, we all need healthy oceans. Oceans generate half of the oxygen people breathe. At any given moment, more than 97% of the world's water resides in oceans. Oceans provide a sixth of the animal protein people eat. They're the most promising source of new medicines to combat cancer, pain and bacterial diseases. Living oceans absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and reduce the impact of climate change  This shows that oceans are vital for humans to continue to live on Earth.  Thus, the standard is decreasing harmful resource production.  C1: Resource Extraction harms the Environment  NATURAL RESOURCE EXTRACTION HARMS THE ENVIRONMENT. Liam Downey [associate professor of sociology at the University of Colorado at Boulder], Eric Bonds [doctoral student at the University of Colorado at Boulder], and Katherine Clark [graduate student in environmental studies at the University of Colorado at Boulder], 'Natural Resource Extraction, Armed Violence, and Environmental Degradation', Organic Environ. 2010 December, vol. 23(4):417-445. Moreover, because natural resources are the ultimate source of all the energy and goods we produce, consume, and throw away, natural resource extraction harms the environment not only at the 'point of extraction' but globally as well. Thus, the grave environmental problems associated with industrial production and consumption (in both capitalist and noncapitalist societies) would not exist, or would not exist in their current form, if industrial societies were unable to efficiently extract and safely transport vast quantities of natural resources.  This shows that natural resource extraction harms our environment we live in and we must reduce or get rid of industries in their current system of extracting resources.  ENVIRONMENTAL DESTRUCTION CAUSES EXTINCTION  Anne Ehrlich amp; Paul Ehrlich, Professor of Biology and Senior Research Scientist at Stanford, 1/9/13 (Can a collapse of global civilization be avoided?,Proceedings of the Royal Society Biological Sciences, Proc. R. Soc. B 2013 280) But today, for the first time, humanity's global civilization'the worldwide, increasingly interconnected, highly technological society in which we all are to one degree or another, embedded'is threatened with collapse by an array of environmental problems. Humankind finds itself engaged in what Prince Charles described as 'an act of suicide on a grand scale' [4], facing what the UK's Chief Scientific Advisor John Beddington called a 'perfect storm' of environmental problems [5]. The most serious of these problems show signs of rapidly escalating severity, especially climate disruption. But other elements could potentially also contribute to a collapse: an accelerating extinction of animal and plant populations and species, which could lead to a loss of ecosystem services essential for human survival; land degradation and land-use change; a pole-to-pole spread of toxic compounds; ocean acidification and eutrophication (dead zones); worsening of some aspects of the epidemiological environment (factors that make human populations susceptible to infectious diseases); depletion of increasingly scarce resources [6,7], including especially groundwater, which is being overexploited in many key agricultural areas [8]; and resource wars [9]. These are not separate problems; rather they interact in two gigantic complex adaptive systems: the biosphere system and the human socio-economic system. The negative manifestations of these interactions are often referred to as 'the human predicament' [10], and determining how to prevent it from generating a global collapse is perhaps the foremost challenge confronting humanity. The human predicament is driven by overpopulation, overconsumption of natural resources and the use of unnecessarily environmentally damaging technologies and socio-economic-political arrangements to service Homo sapiens' aggregate consumption [11'17]. How far the human population size now is above the planet's long-term carrying capacity is suggested (conservatively) by ecological footprint analysis [18'20]. It shows that to support today's population of seven billion sustainably (i.e. with business as usual, including current technologies and standards of living) would require roughly half an additional planet; to do so, if all citizens of Earth consumed resources at the US level would take four to five more Earths. Adding the projected 2.5 billion more people by 2050 would make the human assault on civilization's life-support systems disproportionately worse, because almost everywhere people face systems with nonlinear responses [11,21'23], in which environmental damage increases at a rate that becomes faster with each additional person. Of course, the claim is often made that humanity will expand Earth's carrying capacity dramatically with technological innovation [24], but it is widely recognized that technologies can both add and subtract from carrying capacity. The plough evidently first expanded it and now appears to be reducing it [3]. Overall, careful analysis of the prospects does not provide much confidence that technology will save us [25] or that gross domestic product can be disengaged from resource use [26]  Since resource extraction is harming the environment, and if the environment keeps getting worse due to resource extraction, the human race may no longer exist. All plants and animals will be wiped out and oceans will be ruined. Also, many resources needed for human survival will disappear  C2: Resource Extraction harms oceans. OIL SPILLS WILL POLLUTE ENTIRE OCEANS Allen, 12 (Greg, NPR, 'U.S. Watches Closely As Oil Drilling Begins Off Cuba', 2/13, http://www.npr.org...) There are big plans for oil exploration in the Caribbean, not far off the coast of Florida. A Spanish company recently began drilling in Cuban waters ' just 55 miles from Key West. The well is the first of several exploratory wells planned in Cuba and the Bahamas. The drilling has officials and researchers in Florida scrambling to make plans for how they'll respond in case of a spill. The U.S. currently doesn't allow any drilling for oil off its Atlantic coast or in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. One reason is what's at stake. Florida's tourism-based economy depends on its beaches, fishing and clear Caribbean water. Environmental Concerns The U.S. ban on drilling off of Florida, however, doesn't affect America's Caribbean neighbors. The exploratory well being drilled off of Cuba has many here concerned, including people like Richard Dodge. Dodge is the dean of Nova Southeastern University's Oceanographic Center in Dania Beach, near Fort Lauderdale, and what he's really concerned about is coral. At the school, Dodge and his graduate students raise staghorn coral in outdoor saltwater tanks. Live coral grow in the crystal-clear water, some just finger length. 'These are relatively new ones that we're starting out,' Dodge says. 'But over here, these are ones we'll be transplanting to the wild.' In another tank, large branches of coral will soon be used to help restore damaged reefs. Florida is home to more than three-quarters of the nation's coral reefs ' and they haven't been doing so well. Development and warming oceans have already weakened many. On a map, Dodge points out the location of what he believes is an even bigger potential threat ' the spot where Cuba has approved offshore oil drilling. 'The site that will be drilled,' he says, 'is only about 50 miles from Key West.' The rig drilling off Cuba's northern coast is operating in water that is more than a mile deep. But it's not the depth that concerns Dodge. In the case of a blowout, it's the operation's proximity to the Gulf Stream. 'We're worried that it could get into that stream fast and therefore, within days, impact our coastal ecosystem and coastline,' Dodge says. A spill could potentially affect hundreds of miles of beaches, mangroves and estuaries from the Keys to Palm Beach. Dodge and other marine scientists in Florida are asking the federal government to fund research that would help identify the resources most at risk, and develop guidelines to protect them. Embargo Could Complicate Cleanup Complicating matters is the fact that this new well is being drilled in the waters of a country that's under a strict U.S. embargo. Unless they apply for and receive special permission from the government, U.S. companies are banned from doing any work on the well ' even if there's a spill..  Oil is a natural resource, and this is one case in which people are worried that oil can ruin the oceans and the ecosystems that are very essential to Earth. And without these ecosystems from the ocean, the human race is in danger of extinction.</t>

<t>Round 3: Refutation of opponents argument 'This is a graph of CO2 concentrations and global temperature. If you look closely you can see that every time an ice age ends and the temperature starts rising CO2 levels lag behind a few hundred to thousands of years.'Point 1 Temperature and CO2 - Vostok ice-coreIn Con's graph associated with the above quoted text, what you actually see is Co2 levels increasing fairly consistently with a rise in temperature. However what you also see is the temperature dropping suddenly with a much greater lag in Co2 levels dropping that you see on the rising side of these peaks. If Co2 is the main contributing factor in global temperature, then how could the temperature drop thousands of years before the Co2 levels.Con's graph in this case actually serves to illustrate that Co2 levels are NOT the main contributing factor in global temperature. Point 2 The next graph provided by Con only covers the years between 1850 and 2013, We definitely see a rise in temperature along side the rise of Co2 levels, but what does this mean?In the previous graph which covers 450,000 years, we see the exact same relationship between Co2 and temperature. The only problem is that humans were not present in our current industrial state during the peak shown between 350,000-300,000, nor were we present during the peak between 250,000-200,000, and AGAIN we weren't present during the peak between 150,000-100,000! The only peak we are present for is the one between 50,000 and current, and this last peak looks identical to all the other peaks that have occurred during this ice age!The final graph provided by Con shows a speculative difference between our current measured temperature and then the 'blue line' shows what would have happened with 'NO HUMAN INFLUENCE'. This is pure speculation and has zero bearing on reality. Unless the creators of this graph have somehow managed to visit a parallel universe where Earth has no human inhabitants, this graph should be disregarded entirely because it is pure fiction.Lastly, Con provided a link to Perfluorotributylamine, this gas is extremely rare less than 1 part per trillion. precisely 0.18 parts per trillion, that is less than 2/10ths of 1 part per trillion. I can't even begin to explain how rare that is.This is a big part of the problem with Global warming science, many of these exaggerated claims like this last graph are based on nothing but speculation. They are based on a consensus which is fueled by our desire to 'Not break the planet' I understand this desire, there is no argument that pollution is good. But blaming naturally occurring events like interglacial periods on pollution isn't going to help us better understand our environment. If our Co2 centric models are actually the least accurate, then how can we expect speculative models like the 'NO HUMAN INFLUNCE' model to mean anything but 'PLEASE SUPPORT US EVEN THOUGH OUR SCIENCE IS WRONG'Consensus is only evoked when the science isn't strong enough.</t>

<t>The most important issues facing our environment right now are the depletion of ozone layer, global warming and the subsequent rising sea levels caused by the rapid melting of glaciers in the Antarctica, pollution, land degradation, extinction of species etc. Industrialization is directly responsible for pollution and increase in the global warming. Factories worldwide are responsible for releasing pollutants like carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides etc into the atmosphere which is the prime reason why the ozone layer is depleting. With the rise in the income levels across the world, more and more people are buying vehicles which are adding up to the pollution in the atmosphere. The soil is getting degraded by chemicals like chlorinated hydrocarbons and metals like cadmium (found in the batteries), lead amp; benzene. Large scale use of fertilizers are also making the land unfit for agriculture. Trees are being cut either for wood or for making roads and buildings. The rate of cutting of trees is more in the developing countries. Environmentalists are of the view that in order to preserve the earth for our children and grandchildren, the developing world will have to start practicing sustainable development which will put a cap on their emissions on a yearly basis. The earth cannot support the kind of unrestricted growth which is being seen in the developing world today.</t>

<t>Is there an environmental crisis in the US? My answer to that question is no. The affirmative side lacks the correct evidence to support this claim. Before we venture further in my constructive, we need to find out what a crisis is. The Noah Webster's dictionary defines crisis as, 'an unstable or crucial time or state of affairs in which a decisive change is impending.' Currently, unless I am incapable of thought, there is nothing horrible in which we need to make a decisive change. This is not just my personal conclusion, expert opinions and sources also support this conclusion. During the course of this paper, I will explain why there is no environmental crisis. To begin, I will discuss Alternative Energy and how the fuel we have right now is cleaner than ever. Then, I will discuss pollutants and how they are being controlled. Then I will conclude my constructive by reviewing the evidence. Fossil fuels are hydrocarbons primarily coal, natural gas and oil. These fuels are primarily formed from dead plants or animals over the course of thousands of years. Many environmentalists claim that fossil fuels will run out in the near future. They claim that we are consuming fossil fuels at such an alarming rate, that we will soon run out of them. Science contradicts, however. Based on a graph Professor H.D Maher Jr of the University of Omaha, the amount of oil has actually increased since 1994. It went from 539 billion barrels to 635 billion barrels. Also on the same graph, Natural Gas also went up from 90 BBE (Billion Barrel Equivalent) to 270 BBE. Clearly, we have not discovered all the oil and natural gas in the world; therefore we are not running out resources such as oil.  Many environmentalists claim that due to fossil fuels, the air is getting more polluted. However statistics disagree, 'In spite of the twentieth century's steep population rise, massive industrialization, and the nationwide proliferation of the modern automobile, the air we breathe is cleaner than it has been in decades. Data from the Environmental Protection Agency also confirm that U.S. air quality has improved since 1970,' according to Drew Thorley, writer for the Manhattan Institute. The EPA even agrees that the air we breathe is cleaner than before. What is up with the claims that emissions and air quality when statistics and the EPA clearly contradict? Even with this staggering evidence, Environmentalists claim that much of the technology that helps with pollution is very unstable. However many technologies involving coal, which is considered the dirtiest of all fossil fuels, are very stable and are actually helping coal greatly. Technologies such as Flue Gas Desulfurization and Low Nitrogen Oxide Burners are examples of this. The SO2, Sulfur Dioxide, removal performance of scrubbers has been reviewed. Data reflect that most wet limestone and LSD installations appear to be capable of ~90% SO2 removal. Advanced, state-of-the-art wet scrubbers can provide SO2 removal in excess of 95%... Low Nitrogen Oxide Burners reduce the creation of NOx, a cause of ground-level ozone, by restricting oxygen and manipulating the combustion process. Low NOx burners are now on 75 percent of existing coal power plants' says the NETL and NMA. These technologies are not only reliable; they are currently being used today. Petrogel, a technology developed by Dr. T.C. Chang, helps with pollution caused by oil spills. Here is how Dr. Chang described his technology, 'The difference with PETROGEL is its ability to absorb the oil, not the water, as well as more effectively release the recovered solid wastes. With PETROGEL, the resulting polyolefin/oil mixture can be treated as regular crude oil, suitable for the regular refining processes' There is no waste of natural resources and no pollution in the air or water' Not only does his technology help with oil recovery, it also conserves natural resources and adds no pollution in the air or water. Environmentalists claim renewable forms of energy such as solar, wind and geothermal energies are much better than fossil fuels. They also claim that not only are these energies unlimited, they also come with no repercussions whatsoever in the environment. Science once again contradicts. Solar energy has some very unique disadvantages. Charles Barnheart, lead author of the study at The University of Stanford's Global Climate and Energy Project, explains these costs. 'Batteries with high energetic cost consume more fossil fuels and therefore release more carbon dioxide over their lifetime. If a battery's energetic cost is too high, its overall contribution to global warming could negate the environmental benefits of the wind or solar farm it was supposed to support. Storing energy consumer's energy, and curtailing energy wastes it.' Not only are we wasting resources, the high-end batteries are consuming fossil fuels. The point comes back to the need of fossil fuels to power grids or power plants. The technologies to make solar power the primary source in which people gain power simply does not exist. Wind energy, which can technically function on its own, can be a hazard to avian animals. An environmentalist site by the University of Wisconsin supports this claim. 'Concerns are the avian and bat mortality. These creatures fly into the rotors of the turbines. Federally protected birds and bats near wind farms have raised awareness with the fish and wildlife agencies. Industries and their engineers have been busy however to improve these issues through more proper siting, insulated materials, and research on landscape and the organisms living there.' This can lead to extinction of these federally protected birds. Geothermal Energy Plants can cause earthquakes. Christopher Joyce of the NPR, National Public Radio, says that, 'A geothermal energy plant near the Salton Sea in California taps deep underground heat from the southern San Andreas Fault rift zone. A new study ties the amount of water pulled from the ground by the geothermal plant here to the frequency of earthquakes.' Therefore with these solid evidences I say that even renewable energies have its bad effects on the environment.</t>

    <t>However, these laws and regulations do not comprehensively solve all of the environmental challenges that our continent faces.
Environmental Crises in the US The United States rests atop one of the most diverse ecological regions on the planet, and includes arctic tundra, mountains, plains, coastal regions, forests, swamps, deserts and dense urban areas.
There are several serious ecological disasters and crises that are currently underway in America, or that present a serious risk.
500 Mountains in America's Appalachians have been destroyed by Mountaintop Removal coal mining.
Google Maps Coordinates, showing deforestation' /gt;37.800832,-81.841133 Google Maps Coordinates, showing Massive deforestation Perhaps most horrifying, the human toll is almost unimaginable. We produce 17.28 metric tons of carbon emissions each year in the US.Con points out that many environmental protections have been implemented, and many successful strategies have been implemented to address the dangers caused by over-consumption and the use of fossil fuels. This political control has given rise to the astonishing practice of Mountaintop Removal coal mining. Each of these environments requires a delicate equilibrium in order to maintain it's continued existence, and many of them face unique challenges and potential crises. Overpopulation The US population crossed the 100 million mark as recently as 1915, and has tripled since then.
[8] I am sure that Con will deny that any of these environmental disasters are actually happening. This is Jarrell Cemetery, surrounded on all sides by mining operations. Unlike most European nations, the US population continues to grow rapidly, and will become unsustainable within 100 years, Carbon Emissions Although Con points to improvements in the amount of carbon emissions that are pumped into our air each year, the US remains the world largest polluter of carbon emissions.
Every other resident has been bought out by the coal company, Alpha Natural Resourses (formerly Massey Energy.
What is Mountaintop Removal?Put simply, Mountaintop Removal mining automates the process of coal mining, replacing workers with high explosives.
[4] Conservative estimates of the dollar cost related to premature Mountaintop Removal coal mining from all causes is $42 billion annually.
Roger and his mother Quinnie are the last remaining residents of Lindytown, West Virginia.
Several towns have been erased, and the coal industry is being wiped out - along with the careers and traditions that go along with it.
Above: Areas where Mountaintop Removal mining operations are occurring have the highest rates of cancer deaths in the entire United States.
Nevertheless, I will demonstrate that some environmental crises, some of them very serious, do in fact exist in the US. </t>

<t>Singapore does not limit the number of vehicles per household. They do have a rationing system however. Yet that is not what we are debating. We are debating if vehicles should be limited by household.  I maintain that it should not. I have stated previously that the number per household does not have any effect on traffic or the environment. You continue to maintain that it does. Yet your links embedded in your argument do not back this up. You continue to reference that it works in Japan yet still you provide no documentation (one link I had to sign in to see, I wasn't going to do that, if it was that one I am sorry). The link to Singapore discusses rationing but based on income not household.  I still maintain that the number per household does not effect the number on the road at any one time. I could give every person 10 vehicles yet each person can only drive 1 at a time. If a person has a need for vehicle transportation that doesn't change depending on how many are in each household, even if that number is zero...they will simply pay someone who has a vehicle to take them where they need to go. The miles driven may actually increase under that scenario.  I will freely admit that vehicles cause pollution but I also argue that the economic alternative to a petroleum based economy can result in greater pollution. Vehicles increase a person's economic opportunities, resulting in a greater standard of living, resulting in more wealth...and wealthy societies can more effectively fight pollution. If you doubt that take a look at wealthy cities verse poor cities throughout the world. And it isn't cheap transportation that makes societies poor...its expensive transportation and energy that makes a society poor, or at least some of the main factors.  The Pro has not proved how limiting vehicles PER HOUSEHOLD will help her concerns about traffic and the environment. I have even challenged that her concerns are a problem. Yet even if a voter finds her concerns valid and overriding then I still do not see how her proposal will alleviate those concerns.  Vote Con.</t>

<t>Apology accepted, my friend! Let's debate!  My opponent essentially makes two arguments to support his position: 1) Evolution and life are too complex to have happened by mere chance and 2) Creationism (in the Bible) is logical as it fills in all the gaps that evolution leaves out.  First and foremost, my opponent's first argument does in fact do nothing to support his position. This is because: Even if evolution was wrong, that wouldn't make Creationism automatically right - there are more options. Correct version: If X (evolution) and Y (creationism in the Bible) exist. And X is wrong. Then Y is right. OK, but the reality is: X, Y, Z, A, B, C, D etc... exist. The lists for arguments for life go on and on, and on! Since we live in a reality where the second is more accurate and true, then even if X was wrong, Y isn't right. Thus, your position of Creationism is the most logical answer is not strengthened by flaws in evolution.  Having said that, I will still refute you. My opponent makes an appeal to ignorance (or at least appears to) in stating the evolution states that life, organisms etc... all came about my chance. The reality is almost opposite, although chance does play a part. The basic premise of evolution is: DNA can mutate - random and chance. But... The process of natural selection decides whether these gene mutations are useful to the organism and thus whether they should be kept. Natural selection is not chance, quite the opposite. With this, my opponent's objections to evolution crumbles, after this appeal to ignorance is revealed. However, I would still disagree with:  'How can a complete system like that have come about through random development? Simple it cannot have.'  even if it were true, because appeal to probability is another logical fallacy. But since this is not how evolution works, it does nothing to de-stabilize evolution.  I agree that Creation tell us X and Y, and Z did A and had the foresight to see B etc... That would be brilliant. But these are just claims and not supported by evidence. (If they are, my opponent has not shown any and the X is wrong therefore Y is right is invalid.) Not logical.  Now onto my contentions!  Contention 1:The distribution of fossils supports the Theory of Evolution. The Theory of Evolution predicts that as we move up the higher levels of strata, we should see more complex life forms fossilized, because animals will have evolved more over longer periods of time. However, the Argument for Creationism (should) predict that fossil distribution is random as bunnies were made with cyanobacteria which were made with mammoths which were made with homosapiens etc... OK, fair enough. But which does the evidence support? The Theory of Evolution. The fossil record shows the distribution as predicted by the theory of evolution. You never find mammoths with humans! I conclude that this fact (of the distribution) supports evolution.  Contention 2: Transitional forms support evolution. The Theory of Evolution predicts that because of random mutation and natural selection, we will see animals in transition from one form to another. We should see these in fossils. However, the argument for Creationism states that we shouldn't see any at all, because all animals were made how they are now. What do we see? Transitional forms, supporting evolution. 'From fish to amphibian: The fish Eusthenopteron and the early amphibian Icthyostega share so many characteristics as to constitute a virtual bridge between fishes and amphibians.' As an example. As I understand it, my opponent doesn't believe that we were all made in our current form (or kind, as my opponent calls it, though 'kind' isn't used in science) - so I am not using this against him. Instead, I am posting as a reference and to point this out to any other Creationists who disagree with my opponent. Contention 2 should not affect voting as it is not disproving Creationism as the definition agreed upon by myself and my opponent. Thank you.  These conclude my refutes and arguments. Thank you, I await my opponent's response.</t>

<t>First may I apologise for taking so long to answer.  My argument is simple.  Evolution tries to teach that we came from a primordial soup of single celled organisms which changed and developed through a whole range of life-forms into what we are today.  When you consider the complexity which some organisms need to maintain in order to exist at all, one wonders where the logic lies in assuming that it all happened by accident.  Not only are so many of the creatures which we see around us, including some which are known not to have changed in millennia. Some are even called 'living fossils' because they are still precisely as they were when their ancestors were turning into fossils.  Watch some nature programs, or DVDs and what do you find? So frequently the presenter, scientist or whoever, speaks of design. Who can you have design in something which all happened by accident, by sheer chance? you cannot, for design you need a designer.  Another illogical element to evolutions as an explanation is the way in whihc so much of life on this planet is interdependent.  If it were not for insects, we would have very few plants, if it were not for Ramora, I wonder how well sharks would be able to hunt and eat with the tooth problems they would have, and those are just two simple examples, there are so many more, as ecologists are trying so hard to make us understand.  The interdependence is so great that our causing the extinction of so many species is threatening our own survival, and also affecting the weather patterns adversely.  How can a complete system like that have come about through random development?  Simple it cannot have.  Creation on the other hand tells us where everything came from and why, it gives us not only the origins of everything but the purpose of mankind.  It also shows that the creator had the intelligence to anticipate that the climate and other environmental circumstances, and build into his creation the ability to adapt to their surroundings and food sources.  The biggest example of that being that all of creation, including mankind was originally given fruit and vegetation as food, and yet, when it became necessary, after the flood those who needed to were able to adapt to a carnivorous diet.  Genesis 1:29, 30 'And God went on to say: 'Here I have given to YOU all vegetation bearing seed which is on the surface of the whole earth and every tree on which there is the fruit of a tree bearing seed. To YOU let it serve as food. 30 And to every wild beast of the earth and to every flying creature of the heavens and to everything moving upon the earth in which there is life as a soul I have given all green vegetation for food.' And it came to be so.'  The whole bible story simply expands on the marvellously intelligent working of the designer, and his amazing ability to plan, millennia ahead, and then make sure that his plans work out.  I look forward to seeing how my opponent counters the logic of these impressions of creation</t>

    <t>yes Good reason, no, simple, stupid, oversight. Design = creation. Accident = evolution. Reason.
So in fact I had actually written my round 3, simply neglected to actually submit it it. I talked about complexity of design, indicating design rather than accident, and therefore indicating a designer, someone who organised the appearance of everything we see.
I really don't see any way of making it more complex than that. I had I admit forgotten it in all that is happening in my life at the moment, but when I went to post my 'round 4' what did I find? I found the text below ready and waiting for me.
To me it is very simple, things either happen by accident, or they happen by design.
The Earth has undergone many cataclysmic changes in its history. Again, to me the way our Creator works is extremely logical.' Again I apologise for my oversight. This does backup the idea of diet triggering adaptation within a kind, or what was once referred to as a species before the meaning of the word species was expanded.
To me all of this helps prove the truth of Scripture, and therefore the creation account, which if true can also only be the most logical explanation of how we got here. Again I apologise. There are also, or have been, a number of theories of evolution, but the whole basis of evolution is that it simply happened will stop no creator, because that means God and most evolutionists will tell you that God doesn't exist, it just happened.Our highly intelligent designer, has as I said earlier simply employed a great economy of design.
And when you stop to think that one of the things which humanity shares many of its DNA characteristics with is a banana, all that demonstrates is intelligent economy of design. Of course there are various understandings of what creation means many of them depending on only a very brief reading of Genesis without any real consideration of what it is saying.</t>

    <t>Design = creation.' Accident = evolution. 'To me it is very simple, things either happen by accident, or they happen by design. Allow me to narrow this down a bit further: '...design, indicating design'. I would ask my opponent to see my refute in round 2 to show this. My opponent, despite my refute in round 2 (which he appears to have ignored), is still making an appeal to ignorance fallacy by stating that evolution occurs through accident alone. My opponent's first statements are: 'I have to admit I am very curious to try and understand what alternatives there are in the creation versus evolution debate. Now, onto my opponent's arguments! 'I talked about complexity of design, indicating design rather than accident, and therefore indicating a designer, someone who organised the appearance of everything we see.'
In fact creationism makes no predictions whatever about the distribution of fossils.
The Theory of Evolution in itself doesn't try to explain where life came from, which is what [the ToE] I'm defending.
I thank my opponent for his arguments and apology; I accept the apology. My opponent appears to be saying that if DNA doesn't mutate then children cannot 'take place' [be born/conceived] because the DNA wouldn't be able to change.It does not. 'One thing my opponent appears to forget is that evolution is based on theories such as that expressed by Darwin which attempt to explain where life came from.'
It's satisfying to know that creation doesn't object to natural selection; but my opponent appears to be using this as proof for a Creator.
'The Earth has undergone many cataclysmic changes in its history.
'Creation, as described in Scripture merely explains the reason for that ability to adapt.'
For example, uranium decay, carbon dating, argon-argon dating, fission track dating helium, iodine-xenon, lanthanum-barium, lead-lead, neon-neon etc... 'Creation has no argument with DNA being able to adapt, though I do object to the use of the word mutate, because if DNA could not do that the birth of a child could never take place will stop since DNA changes every time a different type of cell needs to be formed to create that complex structure which is the human body.' I need not make a refute when no logical claim has been made. As he has not even attempted to refute it, merely ignore it; I extend my refute for that. It's true, however, that now the theory is being applied to try to explain how life originated (or 'came from', as my opponent puts it). This fits in with the geologically proved fact that the Earth was originally a single continent, and the geological layers were once flat, but are now tilted at various angles.
Creation has no argument with DNA being able to adapt, though I do object to the use of the word mutate, because if DNA could not do that [mutate, then] the birth of a child ((could never take place)) will stop since DNA changes every time a different type of cells needs to be formed to create that complex structure which is the human body.''
However, based on my round 2 and my opponents first claim, I need not do anything as it shouldn't affect the voting or debate in any way.
My point from round one, therefore, stands; that my opponent attempting to debunk evolution will not strengthen his position whatsoever.
So, this is like me making a fire truck that 'makes no predictions on how to tackle fires'. 'As for 'natural selection' creation has no objection to that either, because all [it] laterally describes is the process which the creator built into every creature to allow it to change to fit the circumstances it finds itself in. I need not refute this. ' </t>

    <t>Is Deforestation really a problem? This means that the forest population could last around 88.8 years.
The UN now plants 1.7 billion trees a year 12 billion total. According to NASA, there are 400 billion trees in the world.
Deforestation would be a problem if it weren't being solved, but it is.The world deforests what amounts to 4.5 billion trees a year (I averaged between 3-6 billion. According to the UNEP Billion Trees Program, all the trees grown under the UN program equaled 2 billion in 18 months after launch. If you leave out Water Vapor.Does Water Vapor really effect Global Warming?
We are in the Global Warming period of the cycle. You see, Urbanized areas (Cities, Towns, Villages) take up 3% of Earth's land...(12,13) If all of the Urban Areas was, by some odd chance, on Arable land, it would cover 28.76% of all Arable Land. Human's responsible for 3.6% of all CO2 emissions. Total number of plants planted would include this amount + all the other Replacement programs.
Argument starts now.-Deforestation.Deforestation verb: To cut down and clear away the trees or forests from. What defines a problem is that it can't, or isn't, being solved. Most companies that deforest have a Replacement Program, obviously they aim to keep their product growing.
After adding this gas in, with it's tiny GWP, it has a maasive effect on human's total effect on the Greenhouse Effect.How much?
The US alone plants 1.5 billion trees a year from nurseries alone.
This number also does not include the trees regrown in corporate Replacement programs, or volunteer programs.
With only 0.28% of the total Greenhouse effect, human's are responsible for raising temperatures 0.003*F over the past century.With this, I conclude that Human's have not overpopulated the Earth.</t>

<t>I apologize if my language wasn't appropriate for a debate. Can you give me some advices of something not to do..? This is one of my first times doing official debates.Because my English isn't that good, there are some points that I don't fully understand. I will summarize your rebuttals so that you may fix my understandings if I am wrong. (it's ok if the summary is only a little off and doesn't cause much misunderstandings)1. Warfare could not be solved because they are caused from from long lasting conflicts. The failure to stop wars isn't from the lack of intelligence but is from making irrational decisions based on their emotions. Learning from the past, it is better to make decisions based on emotions. However, at intense times, humans could pull their minds together and make rational decisions. 2. Humans had been learning from past mistakes and developing their sciences, achieving what is now an amazing achievement. The reason humans don't advance that much is because of human corruption and not the lack of intelligence. Also, the cost of space exploration is incredibly high. The technology humans have nowadays is a proof of intelligence itself. Scientific advance takes time. 3. Understood4. Current medical advancement is a proof of humans' intelligent. It could not advance so fast due to insufficient funds. Conclusion: UnderstoodMy rebuttals1. The failure to control emotions and let emotions control is a proof of our lack of intelligent. Looking back at the past, most conflicts occurred from emotional conflicts; most irrational decisions were made based on emotions. Not being able to surpass emotions, humans are no different from other animals; getting mad when hit or being scared when threatened. If humans really are smart, they should be able to intact their minds all the time and solve problems rationally, whether it's their daily life problems or warfare. 2. Being an intellectual being, humans should learn the fact that sticking with the current space exploration programs, the advancing of technologies would be slow. However, by changing the materials and goods used to build spaceships to other less expensive alternatives would be a large help to the advancement of the technologies. 3. It is humans' fault that the facts about global warming wasn't available in the past. If only humans are intelligent, the problem would have been known long time ago and easily solved before it gets out of hands. Also, protestants don't change the fact that nothing had been done to help reduce and prevent global warming. Something that would be more effective should be done instead. It shows that they are not learning from their actions. Humans falling for greediness is to blame the fact that they aren't intelligent enough to overcome it. Being able to control emotions would largely help humans become intellectual beings. Being able to control emotions is also being able to control greed. Without greed, things that aren't beneficial to humans won't be done and instead, only beneficial things would be done. The government slowly bonding to fight back against carbon emissions is so slow that by the time the have bonded and is ready to seriously stop global warming, the Earth would've become the Sun. 4. Many medical advancements didn't come from our intelligent. They came from mistakes. For example: Penicillin. Being able to advance faster than humans could in the past doesn't make them intelligent. Being intelligent means learning and adapting to problems. Nevertheless, being able to do it fast enough so that you don't die is also a must. Conclusion: Humans, no matter how many rational decisions they made, no matter how much knowledge they have obtained, as long as they still lose to emotions and greed, they are not intelligent. You could call this advancements less stupid, but not more intelligent. Only stating that humans learn from the past makes them an intellectual being, humans always advance, whether it's slowly or rapidly, not solving problems such as global warming because the knowledge wasn't acquired in the past, is not rational. Animals do learn. By intellectual beings, I agree with the given definitions. However, I would like to add that by being an intellectual being, it means that these intellectual beings are high in intelligent and is on average smarter than other existing species. (on Earth)</t>

<t>Introduction I thank my opponent for generously accepting this debate. I am going to be arguing in favor of the notion that homosexuals are an asset to the overall thriving of the human species. Population Growth On average, 360 people are born each day with only 150,000 that die each day[1]. This, on its face, seems like a staggering difference. Also, in 1993 the word population was at 5,535,753,998, however the world population today is roughly 7,066,964,964[2]. This means that in just 20 years the world population has increased by 1,531,210,0966 billion people. Here is a graph which illustrates population growth: Essentially, the point I am trying to get across is that the population is growing at an alarming pace. I think it is clear that the facts substantiate this quite well indeed. The Need For Population Control  Stabilisation, or gradual reduction in population is one of the best ways to address the carbon emissions problem. The National Academy of Sciences demonstrated that slowing the population growth rate of a country to 1.5 births per woman from 2 births per woman could result in a 10% drop in greenhouse gas emissions by the middle of the century, and a 33% drop by the end of the century[3]. Also, the lack of land mass on this planet is a huge issue: “Calculations have been made that any given land mass has a certain carrying capacity, based on its ability to support its inhabitants' needs.” – Colin Feltham[4]Another crucial aspect here is population growth's relation to poverty . Below are some simple statistics from 1950 - 85[5] showing a correlation between a rising population and the percentage of rising poverty:                                                                                                         Table 4-1 World Population 1950-85: Key Facts Size and Rates   1950  1960  1970  1980  1985 Total Population(billions)World2.53.03.74.44.8More developed regions0.830.941.051.141.17Less developed regions 1.68 2.072.653.313.66 Annual Growth *(per cent)World 1.82.01.91.7More developed regions 1.31.00.80.6Less developed regions 2.12.52.32.0 Urban Population(per cent)World2934374041More developed regions5467677072Less developed regions1722252931 As more human beings are being born, higher percentages of poverty throughout the population. Now, I agree that correlation does not necessarily equate to causation. When we are dealing with consistent correlation of this type however, then it does seem to suggest causation at the very least in context. The more people their are, the less finite resources there are for everybody; and poverty arises. This hypothesis would generally predict such statistics above, and best explains the data. The most important problem, in my opinion, is the problem of a growing population and finite resources. For example, theEarth Policy Institute showed that grain consumption of the world has far surpassed global production in six of the latest seven years, falling short with regards to the 60 million tonnes that was seen in 2006. Grain production has shown a huge declining trend within the past 20 years[6]. Also, we are losing our oil at an incredible speed:'The rapid increase in the world’s population over the last hundred years is not merely coincident with the rapid increase in oil production.' - Peter Goodchild[7] This section above shows a self-evident need for population control on a serious scale. There is no realistic way for human beings to flourish and thrive very much longer without it, as the planet cannot sustain this many people continuously into the future like we would hope. It seems apparent that logic, statistical evidence, and mere common sense can lead any rational agent to this obvious conclusion. The Homosexual's Role In Population ControlStraight people are the root cause of the population growth problem, and are on a path to leading our society down a path of pollution, poverty, and famine. They have sex, produce children, and those children grow up and do the same in a world that can barely sustain the people that already live in it. Straight sex acts are required for the existence of a society, but not the flourishing of a society once growth gets unreasonable. Our Earth and its contents are finite, so to think we can keep going on like this is fancifulHomosexuals are crucial to this picture, as they are less likely to have children by copulating with a female and producing offspring. The more homosexual and bisexual people there are having sex, the better grip we will have on population control, and less poverty there will be. It will increase the amount of land we will have to sustain us, and increase the resources in place for us to thrive as a society. With more people being born than dying each day at the hands of straight sex, homosexual acts are a clear benefit when taking population control into account. If everybody on Earth was straight, the problems associated with population growth would be much higher than it is today. It seems very probable that homosexuals may be our savior:'We preserve the species. We are conservation realized. We provide nature's ... restraint ... on procreative extravagance. We keep human production from becoming ... overproduction ... pollution ... destruction unbridled. We keep the human race from becoming ... an obscene cosmic joke.' - G. Roger Denson[8]G. Roger Denson states my main point very well, and also had this to say:'With the natural world on the brink of demise largely because of overpopulation, unrestrained homosexuality, as one of a variety of ethical and democratic measures available to us today, offers perhaps the most natural option to be enjoined. What other options are as attractive? We don't want to die young. We don't want to face illness or catastrophe. Many individuals and societies refuse abortion and birth control. Few would condone or submit willingly to the kind of international law imposing a one-child policy like that exercised by China on all nations. And we hardly need to be reminded of the history of racist, eugenicist, and militarist agendas for imposing growth control on unwilling and unknowing populations. So why shouldn't homosexuality be seen as providing a viable option to overpopulation--to the point that the world's nations come to encourage its practice and esteem its benefits? It is, after all, the most harmonious way to control the population--considering all that's required is that we love and support our gay sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, parents, friends, lovers, and selves.' -  G. Roger Denson[8]Conclusion The population is growing to the point where our planet can barely sustain us. This is due to straight sex acts on a massive scale. Homosexual acts cause somewhat of a balance in nature, as homosexuals are way less likely to have the type of intercourse which creates offspring. Homosexuals are a way to sustain our species; so the planet can sustain us. For this reason, it is reasonable to conclude that homosexuals are an asset to the overall thriving of the human species. I look forward to Con's rebuttal.</t>

<t>I thank Sabutai for letting me part of this debate. I have only just seen the part of the Round 2 requirements which includes the terminology 'no rebuttals by Pro', which I do consider somewhat odd being that Con has provided material which I believe probably does deserve an immediate response in order to give Con time to revise or clarify certain parts of his argument. Still, I do have enough in my arsenal for me to present a better case than what Con presents for my case that humans are indeed the main cause of global warming. Let us begin:  Agriculture  Something that people are not so aware of with regards to global warming is the contribution of agriculture - which is to say livestock and farming - which is third in the world for CO2 emissions. CO2 isn't even the leading GHG emission from farming, as methane is the major contributing by-product. It is huge (1). To quote:  'In 2010, global greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector totaled 4.7 billion tons of carbon dioxide (COv(2)) equivalent, up 13 percent over 1990. Agriculture is the third largest contributor to global emissions by sector, following the burning of fossil fuels for power and heat, and transportation. In 2010, emissions from electricity and heat production reached 12.5 billion tons, and emissions from transport totaled 6.7 billion tons.  Despite their continuing rise, emissions from agriculture are growing at a much slower rate than the sector as a whole, demonstrating the increasing carbon efficiency of agriculture. From 1990 to 2010, the volume of agricultural production overall increased nearly 23 percent, according to data compiled by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) for its program, FAOSTAT. FAO released a new Greenhouse Gas Emissions database for agriculture, forestry and other land use changes in December 2012, which can be found here (http://www.fao.org...).  According to FAO, methane accounts for just under half of total agricultural emissions, nitrous oxide for 36 percent, and carbon dioxide for some 14 percent. The largest source of methane emissions is enteric fermentation, or the digestion of organic materials by livestock, predominantly beef cattle. This is also the largest source of agricultural emissions overall, contributing 37 percent of the total.'  There is, quite simply, no way that this much methane and nitrous oxide are from natural causes, and the fact that 50%of the earth's surface is given over to farm and grazing land means a huge loss of forest, which serves as a carbon sink(the main sink is the oceans, however), so combined deforestation plus emissions from agriculture are man made.  The amount of Arctic Ice Loss  This is now greater than it has been in 3 million years, and this absolutely cannot be said to be from natural causes. To quote (2):  'The thaw and release of carbon currently frozen in permafrost will increase atmospheric CO2 concentrations and amplify surface warming to initiate a positive permafrost carbon feedback (PCF) on climate'. [Our] estimate may be low because it does not account for amplified surface warming due to the PCF itself'. We predict that the PCF will change the arctic from a carbon sink to a source after the mid-2020s and is strong enough to cancel 42-88% of the total global land sink. The thaw and decay of permafrost carbon is irreversible and accounting for the PCF will require larger reductions in fossil fuel emissions to reach a target atmospheric CO2 concentration.  The permafrost permamelt contains a staggering '1.5 trillion tons of frozen carbon, about twice as much carbon as contained in the atmosphere, much of which would be released as methane. Methane is 25 times as potent a heat-trapping gas as CO2 over a 100 year time horizon, but 72 times as potent over 20 years! One of the most conservative assumptions the study made, the lead author Dr. Kevin Schaefer confirmed in an email, is that all of the carbon would be released as CO2 and none as methane.'  And to quote from another study about the Arctic (3):  ' 'The bad news is that there is a clear connection between temperature and the amount of sea ice. And there is no doubt that continued global warming will lead to a reduction in the amount of summer sea ice in the Arctic Ocean. The good news is that even with a reduction to less than 50% of the current amount of sea ice the ice will not reach a point of no return: a level where the ice no longer can regenerate itself even if the climate was to return to cooler temperatures,' [lead author Svend] Funder says. '  So chalk up another point for how influential mankind is in contributing to global warming.  Deforestation  This one is plainly simple (4), because according to CO2 NOW, we find the situation where forest loss contributes 9% to CO2 build up, and forests account for 26% of CO2 absorption, so deforestation has been a huge man made contributor as well.  The reliability and enduring nature of the hockey stick graph  According to the New Scientist article covering the 2006 report of the US National Academy of Science (5):  'The report states: 'The basic conclusion of Mann et al. (1998, 1999) was that the late 20th century warmth in the Northern Hemisphere was unprecedented during at least the last 1000 years. This conclusion has subsequently been supported by an array of evidence that includes both additional large-scale surface temperature reconstructions and pronounced changes in a variety of local proxy indicators, such as melting on ice caps and the retreat of glaciers around the world'.  Most researchers would agree that while the original hockey stick can - and has - been improved in a number of ways, it was not far off the mark. Most later temperature reconstructions fall within the error bars of the original hockey stick. Some show far more variability leading up to the 20th century than the hockey stick, but none suggest that it has been warmer at any time in the past 1000 years than in the last part of the 20th century. ... Climate scientists, however, are only too aware of the problems (see Climate myths: It was warmer during the Medieval period), and the uncertainties were both highlighted by Mann's original paper and by others at the time it was published. ... The new reconstruction has been generated using two statistical methods, both different to that used in the original study. Like other temperature reconstructions done since 2001 (see graph), it shows greater variability than the original hockey stick. Yet again, though, the key conclusion is the same: it's hotter now than it has been for at least 1000 years.  In fact, independent evidence, from ice cores and sea sediments for instance, suggest the last time the planet approached this degree of warmth was during the interglacial period preceding the last ice age over 100,000 years ago. It might even be hotter now than it has been for at least a million years.  Further back in the past, though, it certainly has been hotter - and the world has been a very different place. The crucial point is that our modern civilisation has been built on the basis of the prevailing climate and sea levels. As these change, it will cause major problems.'  It is quite clear that all this evidence is very strong for the weight of man's influence in helping global warming along. I now hand back to Con.  </t>

<t>I would like to thank JonMilne for accepting this debate.I. The Universe and Global WarmingThe current state of the Galaxy and our Sun is affecting our temperatures.I.i. The Rest of the Solar SystemThe Sun clearly is in a warmer phase, because all of the other planets have increasing temperatures as well. 'In 2005 data from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor and Odyssey missions revealed that the carbon dioxide 'ice caps' near Mars's south pole had been diminishing for three summers in a row.Habibullo Abdussamatov, head of space research at St. Petersburg's Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory in Russia, says the Mars data is evidence that the current global warming on Earth is being caused by changes in the sun.'[1]''Global warming on Neptune's moon Triton as well as Jupiter and Pluto, and now Mars has some [scientists] scratching their heads over what could possibly be in common with the warming of all these planets … Could there be something in common with all the planets in our solar system that might cause them all to warm at the same time?''[2] Two things can be drawn from this. One, that if other planets are warming, that it is only natural for the Earth to be warming as well. And second, that even if all these planets did have natural causes, then that is a sign of Earth's natural climatic change, instead of man-made. I.ii. The Position of the Milky Way GalaxyEvery approximately 135 million years, Earth enters a more populated area of the Milky Way, and as a result, more cosmic rays hit the Earth, which causes cooling. Currently, we are in a less populated area of the Milky Way, which means that less of these cosmic rays will be hitting the Earth, which means less cloud formation, and of course, warming. [3] for the source on this hypothesis. The sun can also cause this through evaporation.II. Earthly CausesThere are many internal causes of Global Warming as well. II.i. Ocean Current Anomalies Ocean temperature anomalies seem to be rising-along with the temperature. '...one can model past temperatures as a linear trend (that started well before CO2 was added in any substantial quantity) and periodic bumps... ...temperatures over the last 100+ years look a lot like a linear trend plus ocean cycle-driven bumps'[4] What is causing all the bumps?:[4]As shown in the graph, the PDO, or ocean currents, temperature has affected the average Earth's temperature. II.ii. Clouds: A Continuation of Point I.ii.I mentioned about the position of the Milky Way Galaxy and the Sun in regards to these 'cosmic rays'. Here is a more in depth look at the effects of position. 'The implications, if true, had potentially enormous implications for the debate about natural causes of warming. When the sun is very active, it can be thought of as pushing away cosmic rays from the Earth, reducing their incidence. When the sun is less active, we see more cosmic rays. This is fairly well understood. But if Svensmark was correct, it would mean that periods of high solar output should coincide with reduced cloud formation (due to reduced cosmic race incidence), which in turn would have a warming effect on the Earth, since less sunlight would be reflected back into space before hitting the Earth.Here was a theory, then, that would increase the theoretical impact on climate of an active sun, and better explain why solar irradiance changes might be underestimating the effect of solar output changes on climate and temperatures.'[4]'Since he first suggested his hypothesis over a decade and a half ago, Svensmark and other researchers have slowly been putting together research to test it.' The results were: 'Scientists found that when shielding was removed and natural cosmic rays allowed to hit the chamber, cloud seeding increased dramatically, and it increased substantially again when additional artificial cosmic rays were added. Svensmark appears to have gotten it right.'[5] Proof here is in the next points. III. The 1500-Year Cycle This has to do with a cycle of the climate that can explain the warming. 'Through at least the last million years, a moderate 1500-year warm-cold cycle has been superimposed over the longer, stronger Ice Ages and warm interglacials.'[6]Here is a graph related to this: [7]There are two things we can conclude from this graph. First, that up-and-down cycles are normal for the long-term climate. This century's global warming is nothing new. The second thing we can conclude, is that today's global warming is not as bad as the Medieval Warm Period's peak yet, and the Medieval Warm Period was less than the Holocene Maximum Period. 'Even more important, the earth is not 'the warmest it has ever been.' In fact, the earth was much warmer during the Medieval Warm Period when human agriculture flourished!'[7]'The scientists found evidence that on average, every 1,470 years, plus or minus 500 years, cold, ice-bearing waters, which today circulate around southern Greenland, pushed as far south as Great Britain.'[8] There seems to be a full cycle of up-down-up temperatures of the climate every 1470 years. And this goes as far back as at least 1 million years ago. Currently, we are in an upswing of temperatures, just coming off of the Little Ice Age, the peak to be in a few hundred years, making the peak-to-peak difference between today's global warming and the Medieval Warm Period a little less than 1500 years. So today's Global Warming is a natural, cyclical occurence. IV. The Sun: The Proof of Theories I.ii and II.iiThe sun's cycles have a lot to do with temperatures also. 'In this chamber, 63 CERN scientists from 17 European and American institutes have done what global warming doomsayers said could never be done — demonstrate that cosmic rays promote the formation of molecules that in Earth’s atmosphere can grow and seed clouds, the cloudier and thus cooler it will be. Because the sun’s magnetic field controls how many cosmic rays reach Earth’s atmosphere (the stronger the sun’s magnetic field, the more it shields Earth from incoming cosmic rays from space), the sun determines the temperature on Earth.'[9]'Svensmark matched the data on cosmic rays from the neutron monitor in Climax, Colorado, with the satellite measurements of solar irradiance from 1970 to 1990. Over the period between 1975 and 1989, he found cosmic rays decreased by 1.2 percent annually, amplifying the sun's change in irradiance about four-fold'[6]So, as the sun's activity increases, so does the temperature. This below graph shows the correlation: [10]This graph clearly shows that temperature goes up and down with solar activity, because an increase in solar activity directly correlates with an increase in average temperature 1-2 years later. And as a final side note, I would like to present this graph that helps disprove the anthropogenic cause theory, regarding again, ocean temperature anomalies:[4]So 'nature' created the same temperature trend as 'humans' did.

<t>I thank my opponent for accepting my challenge.   It [Global Warming] is the greatest and most successful pseudoscientific fraud I have seen in my long life as a physicist -Harold Lewis   Billions of dollars are spent every year in Global Warming research, another typical money waste if you ask me. I do not believe the people behind it actuallyve in this pseudo-science, they are fabricating it, and fabrication this big is not just a 'scam', a fabrication this big wants to bring change. That change can range from a few political seats to some evo-fascism, something like what the UN's Agenda 21 would want.  Before I begin, ask yourself this question: What did the green movement accomplish? Collecting money? What is their biggest achievement? Does it involve getting mega-bucks? Why do 1-percenter green movement powerhouses own oil companies? Why is Al-Gore's carbon foot print sky high?   I do find global warming quite silly. It predicts that heat will flow from the atmosphere to the warmer ground. And this violates the second law of thermodynamics.    1-Statistics: Believe it or not, but statistics aren't on the Global Warming's side. The IPCC have been quite creative, but that ain't enough. I will get to it later.  #1   http://www.geocraft.com...   Sure, there aren't many statistics comparing human and natural sources for the GHGs, but which side he billions of dollars invested in order to prove something exists?  It is no secret that nature's GHGs dwarfs man-made GHGs. The chart is accurate enough:   http://www.thinkglobalgreen.org...  Currently general agreement is that 95% of GHG (Greenhouse Gases) are caused by water vapor, and 99.999% of that is of natural origin. We can do little about it.        The claim is: We are disturbing natural balance of the 4.5 billion years old planet and it won't be able to take it due to it's pathetically fragile system. A large portation of this claim may only need a ninth grader to debunk it.   Water Vapour: How big a facor is water? I mean the percentage of water in the atmosphere gets change constantly but we don't witness change in the temperature.  There is a reason it is added list of GHGs. Water is really good at reflecting and absorbing light amp; radiations. In fact, it blows CO2 out of the water (no pun intended).  Collection of quotes admitting it:  http://scienceofdoom.com...    #2    Bring me a source that claims CO2 have a better absorption ability than H2O. They imply that water have some kind of a cycle that makes CO2's effect bigger. Guess what? Water absorbs gasses, adding water to CO2 will create a vacuum. How do you think acid rains are created? How do you think sea creatures create shells? The effect is called 'Carbon Sink'. Read something about it.  http://jennifermarohasy.com... Simple experiment above.  Acid rains take between hours to days to form. Not HUNDREDS of years for the GHGs to FINALLY react to water. It is all simple science.  Try standing on a scale with an ant. Thats H2O against CO2. How does Global Warming pseudo-science explain that? I have no clue...     CO2:First thing you need to know is that carbon is at a State of Equilibrium. That is the point of natural cycles That is the basis of Carbon-14 dating method. If it increases in the atmosphere, there is acid rain. If it increases in oceans, there is sedimentation. And eventually, volcanoes will release the carbonate as CO2.      #3     http://noconsensus.wordpress.com...   Soil CO2: http://www.independent.co.uk...   It may even cause plants to reach their potential: http://articles.baltimoresun.com...    Second of all, it is heavy:   CO2 Mol mass: 44.01 g per Mol CO2 Density: 1.96 KG/m3 Gravity: 1.5189  Air = 28 g per Mol Air Density : 1.2 KG/m3 Gravity: 1  H2O = 18 g per Mol H2O Density : 0.75 kg-m3 Gravity: 0.62   There is a reason there are no plants before there is no oxygen while climbing mountains. That is most of the CO2 is in oceans. Just look at the properties, it is a mess. I need an explanation of how CO2 can get from down here all the way up.   http://news.nationalgeographic.com...     http://www.theregister.co.uk... http://www.theregister.co.uk...   Where is the warming? There is no scientific proof that man-made CO2 causes global warming. Did the surface temperature warm yet? Oh! It didn’t.   The Venus argument: Might aswell mention it here. Other than being a logical fallacy with funny counter-examples. It is completely incorrect and based on false assumptions. If we use the IPCC’s (false) formula, CO2 may only heat it up by 38C, so how come it is hotter than Mercury and have a degree 482C? Because it is a different planet. Infact, CO2 may even cool the planet since Venus have 30-40Km thick clouds that blocks most of the sun’s radiation. That’s why there is little difference in heat between day and night in Venus. Venus have a very weak magnetic field, it takes the planet 246 days to rotate on it’s axis, so all the molten magma is not suppressed and the thousands of volcanoes goes ahoy.         2-What does What again? Global warming does whatever it feels likes. And I am not talking about the “scary” failed apocalypse prophecies. Global warming does everything! It makes ice melt, it makes ice thicken. Decide on something already!   http://www.theregister.co.uk...   http://www.realclimate.org...   http://www.usatoday.com...     I might as well start a theory about “Global Cooling”… Ops… It was invented in the 70s… Lets cut the hypocrisy already…   Cow Fart-Gas gt; Human transportation GHG http://science.howstuffworks.com... http://timeforchange.org...   So we should eat less meat! http://www.guardian.co.uk...   Heck, we should be like this woman: http://www.dailymail.co.uk... We exhale CO2 (Shocker...)       3-The missing link: Contrary to the popular belief, evolution isn’t the only one in the manhunt.   According to geological ice sample study, the earth is in a period of cooling and warming.    #4   I am not a climate change denier (Ironic right?). There is nothing we can do against nature.     The recent history’s hottest period is 2000 years ago, which is before cigarettes were invented (So you may scratch that out as a cause). http://www.dailymail.co.uk... Whats that? I’d almost say humans have nothing to do with it. The world was NOT flooded back then, and it won’t start flooding now.         4-The trustworthy IPCC: Calling the IPCC trustworthy is a relative statement. But according to an average hillie billie’s standards, the IPCC is the furthest from “Trustworthy”. The IPCC does not even do research, the fact they have been caught faking so many times is enough.   http://wattsupwiththat.com... http://tucsoncitizen.com...      #5   http://www.dailymail.co.uk...

<t>Please note that my opponent have failed to respond to any of my arguments or challenges, I gave him the option to defend and create arguments against different aspects of criticism on Global Warming, and yet. We still have the Co2 weight problem, the thermodynamic laws problem, the water vapor percentage and absorption problem, the history problem, the fraud problem, the corruption problem. Cramming those up objections against the theory and putting them aside, like our friend here did, shows failure to respond and defend. Which brings us to these annoying emotional argument.And you want the Co2 ppm to get lower than this? You do realize plants can't preform photosynthesis with 150-200 Co2 ppm right?http://cdn5.theweedblog.com...I'd say the concentration is quite balanced since there is no gument that the current Co2 concentration is harmful.1-Law of thermodynamics:1- The warm earth surface radiates heat to the cooler atmosphere.2- The cool body (uphysically) re-radiates the heat it got back to the warm body.3- This continuous process's net result causes the warmer body to become warmer.http://www.grc.nasa.gov...The earth is not an isolated system, the earth is not flat. The cooling happens at night, the rate of 240 W/m^2 is not going to change because of 0.000390 Co2. Just bring me one thermodynamic text that mentions 'Back/reflected heat radiations', it is impossible for a cooler body to warm the source of it's heat.It is true that all bodies releases radiations, but the earth surface's radiation is 10 times stronger than the atmosphere's radiation. Result: The earth cools, not get 11 times the atmosphere's radiations back.2-Co2 weight: CO2 Mol mass: 44.01 g per Mol CO2 Density: 1.96 KG/m3 Gravity: 1.5189  Air = 28 g per Mol Air Density : 1.2 KG/m3 Gravity: 1  H2O = 18 g per Mol H2O Density : 0.75 kg-m3 Gravity: 0.62 Gravity is almost constant at your everyday heights. What I want to know is how Co2 is going to get down here all the way to the atmosphere. Why do ocean hold the majority of Co2?3-Absorption:http://cosmoscon.files.wordpress.com...Water absorption infrared radiations MUCH more than Co2, how can GW be man-made if such a thing exists?Not to mention that it is 24,400 ppm.I was planning to watch a horror movie soon, but what the hell.

<t>I would like to thank Citrakayah for accepting this debate. I. Natural Factors Point to Little or No Change In The Climate I.A. The SunThe sun is the main driver of the global climate. The level of activity from the sun correlates with the average global temperature. The sun is currently decreasing in activity, meaning that the warming of the 1970s-1990s will soon be erased. 'Changes in the Sun can account for major climate changes on Earth for the past 300 years, including part of the recent surge of global warming.'[1] The sun can account for most of the warming experienced over the past century, and correlates well with the rising and falling of temperatures when compared to 20th century temperatures:  [2]I.A.1. Solar Flux PredictionsSolar activity has been declining for a little over a decade and will continue to do so for at least the foreseeable future. ''Normally, the conveyor belt moves about 1 meter per second—walking pace,' says Hathaway, 'That's how it has been since the late 19th century.' In recent years, however, the belt has decelerated to 0.75 m/s in the north and 0.35 m/s in the south. 'We've never seen speeds so low.''[19] This means that solar activity has been declining recently. The next solar cycle, number 25, is projected to be one of the lowest in centuries.[19] 'Storms from the sun are expected to build to a peak in 2013 or so, but after that, the long-range indicators are pointing to an extended period of low activity — or even hibernation.'[3] In fact, we are already beginning to experience this lowered solar activity.[5][6]This graph illustrates the recent decline in solar activity. Note the downward trend in solar activity overtime:  [4]With solar activity leveling off, temperatures will go back down to normal. In addition, there will be fewer hazardous rays coming from the sun and fewer solar storms, meaning fewer disruptions to the satellite systems we rely on so heavily. I.A.2. Cosmic Ray FluxWith decreased solar activity, there is increased cosmic ray penetration of the Earth's atmosphere. Cosmic rays are inversely proportional to solar activity and proportional to cloud cover; and greater cloud cover means cooler temperatures.[19][10][11] I.A.3. Ocean Currents Ocean currents are the main internal drivers of the global climate. They have an R-squared correlation of 0.83, which is pretty significant (the highest score is 1).[7] Here is a chart showing ocean current's correlation to temperatures:   [7] The sun is the main driver of ocean current temperatures, 'This [solar activity] is the single most important cause [of ocean currents and their temperatures]. The Sun provides the bulk of the energy which drives the circulation of water in the oceans, either directly or indirectly (through winds). The uneven distribution of solar energy across the globe (highest at the equator, decreasing towards the poles) produces an uneven heating of water in the ocean.'[20] When plotted together, solar activity and ocean current activity correlate well (notice the decline in solar activity after WWII, and the subsequent fall in ocean current activity around the same time).[2][7][8]Ocean currents, because of the sun's cooling and because of its natural three-decade cycles of warm and cool, ocean currents are projected to cool down further than today and to continue that pattern for at least another few decades. 'Because PDO cycles last 25 to 30 years, Easterbrook expects the cooling trend to continue for another 2 decades or so.'[9] Here is a graph showing ocean current's temperatures since 1900:     [8]Note how all three currents are experiencing decreasing temperature trends, which, due to their current short duration, should continue for at least two more decades, and then another few decades to get back (possibly) to a peak. With decreased solar activity causing lower ocean current temperatures, the Earth will cool somewhat over at least the next few decades, albeit it shouldn't be that much. The climate will stay around normal. I.B. The 1500-Year CycleThere exists a 1500-year climatic cycle of peak-trough-peak (or vice versa) temperature cycles. 'Through at least the last million years, a moderate 1500-year warm-cold cycle has been superimposed over the longer, stronger Ice Ages and warm interglacials.'[12]Here is an illustration of this cycle:  [13] This warm trend is projected to continue for around a few more centuries, and then the cycle will flip into a cold pattern.[12] This warm period will help counterbalance some of the effects of a diminishing sun. As solar activity does its ups and downs, the counterbalance between the Earth and the Sun will help keep Earth's climate systems in check. The various natural factors contributed by solar activity and the Earth's 1500-year cycle point to an insignificant change in the Earth's climate. Temperatures should not be much higher or lower than they usually are on average over the next few centuries. While the sun is cooling, the Earth will continue to heat the planet somewhat until solar activity returns and we have another temperature rise. It's a rise-and-fall situation.II. Positive Effects of the Current Interglacial and Warm PeriodA moderately warm period is better than a cold period. If the temperature is not too warm, a warm climate can have positive effects on both the Earth as a whole and on everyone. II.A. Health EffectsIn moderation, warm temperatures are better for the body than cold temperatures. People cannot get enough heat, infections are rampant, and hospital admissions will rise in the cold. From 1979 to 1997, extreme cold killed roughly twice as many Americans as heat waves [coincidentally when the Earth was heating up].[14][12] In Germany, heat waves were found to reduce overall mortality rates slightly, while cold spells led to a significant increase in deaths.[15][12] In addition, warmer weather decreases incidences of strokes, respiratory diseases, and the flu.[12]In general, life expectancies are higher in warmer climates, and there are fewer incidences of disease and other health problems. A warm period would be beneficial to human health. II.B. Economic BenefitsSome of the major industrial sectors, particularly agriculture, tend to work better in a warmer environment than they do in a cooler environment. 'The book [The Impact of Climate Change] finds that a moderate warming will have a positive economic impact on the agriculture and forestry sectors. Since carbon dioxide is used by plants to capture and store energy, there may be a fertilizing effect as levels of the gas rise. This, combined with longer growing seasons, fewer frosts and more precipitation, among other factors, could benefit some economic sectors.'[16][17]CO2 increases, a byproduct of temperature increases ([12]), naturally help to stimulate plant growth as well, further helping agriculture. 'For a 300 ppm increase in the atmosphere's CO2 concentration above the planet's current base level of slightly less than 400 ppm, for example, the productivity of earth's herbaceous plants rises by something on the order of 30%, while the productivity of its woody plants rises by something on the order of 50%.'[18][21]This further helps humans by increasing food yields, lowering rates of starvation and hunger. Conclusion There should be an insignificant change in the climate over the next couple of centuries as the sun continues its cycles and the Earth is in a moderately warm period. In the short term, the major factors in the climate show a decrease in temperature, but the long term shows a stabilization of temperatures to a reasonably warm level. This increases humans' life expectancies and increases crop yields, reducing the incidence of hunger, thereby further aiding in the increases in life expectancies. There is no rational reason to worry about the climate going off the deep end in the near future. On the contrary, our current climatic state seems to be helping us. Sourceshttp://tny.cz...</t>

<t>I'm new here as well, best of luck.  The Pro's opening argument consists of two basic ideas; that technology is advancing fast and that that it is beneficial to us. Now, I won't deny my usage of technology. I think everyone in industrialized countries in fact takes technology for granted at time. But I can't say I agree that technology advancement is necessarily for the better. In a world that has made so many technological developments in the past century alone, we can see that it's probably been more of a detriment to us than beneficial. I have 5 primary contentions to the Pro. I will label all of the arguments so you can address them easier.  1. Terrorism Harms Increase in weapons such as bombs, guns, and even using vehicles to kill people (whether it's cars or planes). I think this is a common argument and doesn't need much elaboration. In the next century we're bound to blow up the planet. Technology has shown to hurt our collaboration between countries, and terrorism is (sadly) a growing danger to people of the 'superpower' countries on our planet.  2. Social Media Impact Harms We become self-reliant on technology; things like social media have absolutely consumed young peoples' lives. I can't deny that when I don't have Internet for an extended period of time I feel beyond deprived. But after awhile, I realize I don't need it. I think technology hurts face-to-face communicative ability of our youth. I'll admit I like things like Facebook, but I don't let it affect my schooling. When I can seriously see people in an 8-hour day of school use their phone so much I can't believe it. They text, IM, they use social media, they take pictures, they don't focus on the material being taught at that moment in class, they act inappropriately if they get their phones taken away. Technology hurts our youth far too much.  3. Social Media Harms - Extension (thought this little portion needed it's own section) There is further concern when people can go as far as to RUINING someone's life on the Internet. People are much more hurtful in modern times..  4. Human Extinction Harm Population increase is shown to be a big problem, we're expected to surpass our carrying capacity within the next century, and quite frankly we don't have a good solution for that. When technology has helped with the developments of medicine by preventing death and increasing life spans its made for a big problem on Earth. The increase in technology can go as far as put us through extinction! If that doesn't shoot down your belief that technological growth (especially at this rate) is good... I'm not sure what will!  5. Animal Extinction/Habitat Destruction My final argument is going to simply be showing the effects on other life on Earth. Many species have faced extinction because of man, we do things like deforestation that destroys their habitat, polluting oceans. I don't want to extend on this too much to be quite honest.  By reflecting on what has been said by both sides so far; I agree that progress can help out in life.. I don't think technological growth is beneficial to our planet, to other species on this planet, and furthermore.. to us.</t>

<t>Sorry for the late post.  Well, this is my last round, and I will have no more to say after you post your final argument. It was a pleasure debating with you thus far and you have provided some formidable cases to me. I will invite you to another debate that I am planning to create soon, probably the effects of a free market on a population.  A point I want to make is that while one animal is going extinct, scientists are figuring out ways to bring back two animals. The idea is that while forests are being cut down, some are being preserved and much more action is being taken to relive those forests' once glory. Or, while some unlucky few are being embarrassed online, many more others are gaining a large benefit for the same reason. Think of how education has changed - even if youth are slightly more inclined to desire to be occupied with a phone, the class parts that they pay attention to are growing exponentially in terms of effectiveness. With the arrival of iPads, SmartBoards, and other multimedia presentation technologies, students are able to learn what was a week's worth of knowledge in the 20th century in a single day today.  Technology is also a new frontier in careers. Not to forget the availability of applications and online work jobs that are improving people's lives, but there are thousands of new prospects for those with a talent in technology. These jobs pay well, and they wouldn't be here without this recent Industrial Revolution. That's another benefit that technology bestows upon us.  Now think of factories. Without an assembly line, robotic arms, or the easy transport of goods, the huge industrial booms of the 20th century could not have been possible. Cars would be more expensive and less frequently used if not for the technological advances that gave people robotic arms, assembly lines, and easy transportation. Cars, specifically, are a perfect example of the way technology has been affecting our lives. At first, production explodes and the environment is taking a big hit, but eventually cars are getting more and more efficient. Now, as technology is really growing fast, cars that run on cleaner sources or cars that run for twice or thrice as long are being sold. People saw that they were hurting the environment and were a quickly growing problem. Now guess what? 'SmartCars' and bicycles are the new preference, and some completely electric automobiles are on the way. It goes to show that while almost every aspect of technology's advance can yield harsh costs, if applied directly, these drawbacks can be reduced to minor issues that aren't important.  On the topic of climate change and the extinction of animals, there has been action diverted to this issue as well. Many new organizations and parks are being created for the preservation of nature, and for the life of animals. In my previous statement, I didn't mean to say that animals were unimportant, but that the people who can choose to collect some money and destroy an acre of forest or do nothing would prefer to rake in the cash. However, people who live like that are quickly being thrown out of their position.  Now on to your statements about terrorism and such, specifically. If we simply cannot come to an agreement with terrorist groups to leave each other alone (which could be made easier by technology, by the way), then the least we can do is use the very same technology breakthroughs to arm ourselves well from any attack they hold on us. Honestly, though, I doubt that if we remove ALL our troops from their country, make up for our troubles with some support for their people, and completely be isolated from those areas, that they will still burn with desire to bomb us. If anyone in power had the idea to try that out and focus on more important internal issues such as climate change or homelessness, well who knows things would change.  With human extinction problems, the current answer has been to build up. That works, really, and it makes for beautiful developed cities, but there is still overpopulation in India and China! Why is this? If you know the geographic phrase 'The rich get richer and the poor have more kids', then you may be familiar with this. Poor families need more children to do more survival farming, but they are still not able to feed them more than the bare minimum, and those kids each have their own children, and it grows extremely quickly. If, say, a more developed government was there to help its citizens instead of dictating the country, this issue wouldn't be happening. In addition, even if this problem would still exist with a helpful government, large apartment buildings or multi-houses can be build with new technologies and help to reduce the overcrowding population in places such as India or China.  The final statement that I want to make clear:  Whatever harms technology will bring due to man's unjust intentions can be reversed and sent flying in the opposite direction as long as attention is brought to the problem. This example is shown well with the evolution of commercial automobiles and the cutting down (and rebuilding) of forestry around the world.</t>

<t>I would like to thank Magic8000 for accepting this debate. I. The Universe and Global WarmingThe current state of the Galaxy and our Sun is affecting our temperatures.I.i. The Rest of the Solar SystemThe Sun clearly is in a warmer phase, because all of the other planets have increasing temperatures as well. 'In 2005 data from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor and Odyssey missions revealed that the carbon dioxide 'ice caps' near Mars's south pole had been diminishing for three summers in a row.Habibullo Abdussamatov, head of space research at St. Petersburg's Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory in Russia, says the Mars data is evidence that the current global warming on Earth is being caused by changes in the sun.'[1]''Global warming on Neptune's moon Triton as well as Jupiter and Pluto, and now Mars has some [scientists] scratching their heads over what could possibly be in common with the warming of all these planets … Could there be something in common with all the planets in our solar system that might cause them all to warm at the same time?''[2] Two things can be drawn from this. One, that if other planets are warming, that it is only natural for the Earth to be warming as well. And second, that even if all these planets did have natural causes, then that is a sign of Earth's natural climatic change, instead of man-made. I.ii. The Position of the Milky Way GalaxyEvery approximately 135 million years, Earth enters a more populated area of the Milky Way, and as a result, more cosmic rays hit the Earth, which causes cooling. Currently, we are in a less populated area of the Milky Way, which means that less of these cosmic rays will be hitting the Earth, which means less cloud formation, and of course, warming. [3] for the source on this hypothesis. The sun can also cause this through evaporation.II. Earthly CausesThere are many internal causes of Global Warming as well. II.i. Ocean Current Anomalies Ocean temperature anomalies seem to be rising-along with the temperature. '...one can model past temperatures as a linear trend (that started well before CO2 was added in any substantial quantity) and periodic bumps... ...temperatures over the last 100+ years look a lot like a linear trend plus ocean cycle-driven bumps'[4] What is causing all the bumps?: [4]As shown in the graph, the PDO, or ocean currents, temperature has affected the average Earth's temperature.    II.ii. Clouds: A Continuation of Point I.ii.I mentioned about the position of the Milky Way Galaxy and the Sun in regards to these 'cosmic rays'. Here is a more in depth look at the effects of position. 'The implications, if true, had potentially enormous implications for the debate about natural causes of warming. When the sun is very active, it can be thought of as pushing away cosmic rays from the Earth, reducing their incidence. When the sun is less active, we see more cosmic rays. This is fairly well understood. But if Svensmark was correct, it would mean that periods of high solar output should coincide with reduced cloud formation (due to reduced cosmic race incidence), which in turn would have a warming effect on the Earth, since less sunlight would be reflected back into space before hitting the Earth.Here was a theory, then, that would increase the theoretical impact on climate of an active sun, and better explain why solar irradiance changes might be underestimating the effect of solar output changes on climate and temperatures.'[4]'Since he first suggested his hypothesis over a decade and a half ago, Svensmark and other researchers have slowly been putting together research to test it.' The results were: 'Scientists found that when shielding was removed and natural cosmic rays allowed to hit the chamber, cloud seeding increased dramatically, and it increased substantially again when additional artificial cosmic rays were added. Svensmark appears to have gotten it right.'[5] Proof here is in the next points. III. The 1500-Year Cycle This has to do with a cycle of the climate that can explain the warming. 'Through at least the last million years, a moderate 1500-year warm-cold cycle has been superimposed over the longer, stronger Ice Ages and warm interglacials.'[6]  Here is a graph related to this:  [7]There are two things we can conclude from this graph. First, that up-and-down cycles are normal for the long-term climate. This century's global warming is nothing new. The second thing we can conclude, is that today's global warming is not as bad as the Medieval Warm Period's peak yet, and the Medieval Warm Period was less than the Holocene Maximum Period.    'Even more important, the earth is not 'the warmest it has ever been.' In fact, the earth was much warmer during the Medieval Warm Period when human agriculture flourished!'[7]'The scientists found evidence that on average, every 1,470 years, plus or minus 500 years, cold, ice-bearing waters, which today circulate around southern Greenland, pushed as far south as Great Britain.'[8] There seems to be a full cycle of up-down-up temperatures of the climate every 1470 years. And this goes as far back as at least 1 million years ago. Currently, we are in an upswing of temperatures, just coming off of the Little Ice Age, the peak to be in a few hundred years, making the peak-to-peak difference between today's global warming and the Medieval Warm Period a little less than 1500 years. So today's Global Warming is a natural, cyclical occurence.    IV. The Sun: The Proof of Theories I.ii and II.iiThe sun's cycles have a lot to do with temperatures also.  'In this chamber, 63 CERN scientists from 17 European and American institutes have done what global warming doomsayers said could never be done — demonstrate that cosmic rays promote the formation of molecules that in Earth’s atmosphere can grow and seed clouds, the cloudier and thus cooler it will be. Because the sun’s magnetic field controls how many cosmic rays reach Earth’s atmosphere (the stronger the sun’s magnetic field, the more it shields Earth from incoming cosmic rays from space), the sun determines the temperature on Earth.'[9]'Svensmark matched the data on cosmic rays from the neutron monitor in Climax, Colorado, with the satellite measurements of solar irradiance from 1970 to 1990. Over the period between 1975 and 1989, he found cosmic rays decreased by 1.2 percent annually, amplifying the sun's change in irradiance about four-fold'[6]So, as the sun's activity increases, so does the temperature. This below graph shows the correlation:   [10]This graph clearly shows that temperature goes up and down with solar activity, because an increase in solar activity directly correlates with an increase in average temperature 1-2 years later. And as a final side note, I would like to present this graph that helps disprove the anthropogenic cause theory, regarding again, ocean temperature anomalies:     [4]So 'nature' created the same temperature trend as 'humans' did.</t>

The sun is warming since other planets are warming.The sun isn’t warming at all, in fact it’s cooling. A study by Usoskin in 2005 debunks the claim that the Earth is warming due to a warming sun. He writes '...during these last 30 years the solar total irradiance, solar UV irradiance and cosmic ray flux has not shown any significant secular trend, so that at least this most recent warming episode must have another source.' [1]In fact, the sun has been contributing to some cooling in the past few decades. [2]Other studies have also debunked the claimA study by Erlykin says“We deduce that the maximum recent increase in the mean surface temperature of the Earth which can be ascribed to solar activity is 14% of the observed global warming.' [3]'Although solar and volcanic effects appear to dominate most of the slow climate variations within the past thousand years, the impacts of greenhouse gases have dominated since the second half of the last century.' -Ammann [4]'The variations measured from spacecraft since 1978 are too small to have contributed appreciably to accelerated global warming over the past 30 years.'- Foukal [5]So what about the other planets? First off Con commits the fallacy of composition, his reasoning is “if 1 planet is warming naturally all planets are warming naturally”. You must agree other planets are very different from Earth.Mars: Observations show Mars is experiancing short term regional warming, but not long term global warming. [6]Pluto: MIT scientists explain “Pluto’s orbit is much more elliptical than that of the other planets, and its rotational axis is tipped by a large angle relative to its orbit. Both factors could contribute to drastic seasonal changes.” [7]Jupiter: Global warming isn’t happening on Jupiter, it’s predicted. It's said to warm not because of the sun, but because “the loss of these atmospheric whirlpools, the average temperature on Jupiter will change by as much as 10 degrees Celsius, getting warmer near the equator and cooler at the poles,' [8]Neptune: Neptune is warming. Its orbit is 164 years, our observations are less than a third of Neptune's year. The climate modeling of Neptune says Neptune is undergoing a seasonal change into summer. [9]This also would cause Triton's atmosphere to become thinner, causing warming. [10]2. The sun via cosmic rays are causing global warming.Looking at the data disproves this hypothesis. While cosmic rays are high the temperature is also high.Annual average GCR counts per minute (blue - note that numbers decrease going up the left vertical axis, because lower GCRs should mean higher temperatures) vs. annual average global surface temperature (red, right vertical axis)From NOAA [11], The Neutron Monitor Database [12], and Skeptical Science [13]'between 1970 and 1985 the cosmic ray flux, although still behaving similarly to the temperature, in fact lags it and cannot be the cause of its rise. Thus changes in the cosmic ray flux cannot be responsible for more than 15% of the temperature increase'- Krivova [14]'galactic cosmic rays appear to play a minor role for atmospheric aerosol formation events, and so for the connected aerosol-climate effects as well.'- Kulmalahttp://www.atmos-chem-phys.net...Correlations between low clouds and cosmic rays broke in 1991, then cloud cover began to lag cosmic rays by 6 months [15] ,even though cloud formation should happen within a few days [16]Svensmark said the loss of correlation was because of long term calibration drift in ISCCP satellites, but the ISCCP themselves disagreehttp://www.realclimate.org...Sloan and Wolfendale pointed out Chernobyl disaster should've produced increased cloud cover according to this hypothesis, but there was nonehttp://arxiv.org...'In this chamber, 63 CERN scientists from 17 European and American institutes have done what global warming doomsayers said could never be done — demonstrate that cosmic rays promote the formation of molecules that in Earth’s atmosphere can grow and seed clouds,”This was based off a false understanding of the CERN paperSee the first video.3. Oceans are causing global warming.The oceans would cool when its heat goes to the atmosphere. Observations show oceans are warming [17]. The oceans are actually good evidence for the resolution.'the observed ocean heat-content changes are consistent with those expected from anthropogenic forcing, which broadens the basis for claims that an anthropogenic signal has been detected in the global climate system.' [18]4. 1500-Year CycleCon makes another category error here. There’s defiantly a 1500 year climate cycle. We know that from ice core data from Greenland -as Con cited-, but these events known as the “Dansgaard-Oeschger events” don’t increase the global temperature. It’s only a temperature shift or a see-saw temperature change in the 2 hemispheres. [19]Also see the second video.4a. The Medieval Warm PeriodCon cites the Medieval Warm Period to try and prove his claim about the 1500 year cycle. However there’s no evidence that shows the MWP was as warm globally as it is today.NOAA says“In summary, it appears that the late 20th and early 21st centuries are likely the warmest period the Earth has seen in at least 1200 years.” [20]and“The idea of a global or hemispheric 'Medieval Warm Period' that was warmer than today however, has turned out to be incorrect.” [21]Here’s the differences5. Temperature of 1895-1946 vs 1957-2008At the very end Con posts a chart of the temperature of 1895-1946 and 1957-2008. Both are very similar and seem to prove climate change is by nature. Based on data from Hadlet, GISS, NOAA, NCEP R1, NCEP TCR, ERA-40, and AMTI, Skeptical Science formed these 2 charts around those time periods. It’s close enough to see the claim is wrong[22]Back to ConSources in link below[1] </t>

<t>1st water is a renuable resource and we shouldn't worry about whether or not it takes more water for a cow then wheat, because it is all going to be renewed and if we chose not to eat those cows they would consume more water to live longer.  You could post the arguement to that that plants create oxygen and when we eat more and more plants that is depleting the oxygen so if everyone turns vegetarian we will start running out of oxygen. Neither of these I believe will have a big effect on humanity I believed was just stating the parralex argument that seemed to work with it.  Second We don't need to worry about fossil fuels causing climate change ohh that's right they used to call it global warming but since they were wrong and it didn't exist they changed it here is why climate change is false, 'Those who belive that there is no evidence for global warning often argue that extremely accurate temperature gauges that can measure temperatures to within .01-degrees Celsius have shown no evidence of global warming over the last 25 years. While some can consider this a plateau, these satellite readings correspond with land readings taken for years before this; there has been little recorded climbs in temperature.  Scientific Debate While many scientists are willing to go on record to point out trends in global warming, more than 17,000 scientists have signed a petition circulated by the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine saying that they see no evidence of global warming at all. Less formal surveys amongst climatologists have pointed in the same direction.  No Future Prediction While it is tempting to look ahead at what global warming could do if left unchecked or untreated, it is currently impossible to predict actual climate change in this manner. There are currently no computers sophisticated enough to extrapolate from current data in a reliable pattern that can indicate future climate temperatures.'(1)  Next I would like to say why animal rights shouldn't be a question. If you are an evolutionist you believe in survival of the fittest and that the better smarter species will weed out the lesser species, yes of course now days we try and keep a couple around but working against extinction of animals is very condridicting if your an evolutionist.  If you area Christian or Catholic or Mormon or Judiest you believe in the Torah 1st five books of the bible which say man is to rule over all the animals, 'Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.'(2)  So to all those religions their God says it is ethical to eat and rule over them.  And you say that it matters that a cow has 80 percent human DNA so they are part human well you also sited that rice is 15 percent well that means that are also part human so if you believe one you have to believe the others or that's almost unethical to say one human cousin is more important then the other. That is if you believe that which I don't. I'm going to start a Rice rights group  Rights for  Intellectual  Creatures that shouldn't be  Eaten  Rice lol  Now we should attempt better conditions for these animals like maybe put them to sleep before they are slaughtered not that it matters that much what an animal is feeling.  Most people fight for animal rights and no pain for animals but they believe abortion is fine they are just as alive in that stomach as some animal is but that child is going to grow into a living breathing human that could be having a debate like this in the future,so if you count feeling pain as a sign of being alive like a human you better not be an abortion supporter,'With the advent of sonograms and live-action ultrasound images, neonatologists and nurses are able to see unborn babies at 20 weeks gestation react physically to outside stimuli such as sound, light and touch. The sense of touch is so acute that even a single human hair drawn across an unborn baby's palm causes the baby to make a fist.  Did you know that this 20-week-old unborn child can feel pain? Surgeons entering the womb to perform corrective procedures on tiny unborn babies have seen those babies flinch, jerk and recoil from sharp objects and incisions.  'The neural pathways are present for pain to be experienced quite early by unborn babies,' explains Steven Calvin, M.D., perinatologist, chair of the Program in Human Rights Medicine, University of Minnesota, where he teaches obstetrics.  Medical facts of fetal pain Anatomical studies have documented that the body's pain network'the spino-thalamic pathway'is established by 20 weeks gestation.  ' 'At 20 weeks, the fetal brain has the full complement of brain cells present in adulthood, ready and waiting to receive pain signals from the body, and their electrical activity can be recorded by standard electroencephalography (EEG).' ' Dr. Paul Ranalli, neurologist, University of Toronto  ' An unborn baby at 20 weeks gestation 'is fully capable of experiencing pain. ' Without question, [abortion] is a dreadfully painful experience for any infant subjected to such a surgical procedure.' ' Robert J. White, M.D., PhD., professor of neurosurgery, Case Western University  Unborn babies have heightened sensitivities Unborn babies at 20 weeks development actually feel pain more intensely than adults. This is a 'uniquely vulnerable time, since the pain system is fully established, yet the higher level pain-modifying system has barely begun to develop,' according to Dr. Ranalli.  'Having administered anesthesia for fetal surgery, I know that on occasion we need to administer anesthesia directly to the fetus, because even at these early gestational ages the fetus moves away from the pain of the stimulation,' stated David Birnbach, M.D., president of the Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology and self-described as 'pro-choice,' in testimony before the U.S. Congress.  Given the medical evidence that unborn babies experience pain, compassionate people are viewing abortion more and more as an inhumane and intolerable brutality against defenseless human beings.  The unborn baby at 20 weeks Fetal development is already quite advanced at 20 weeks gestation:  ' The skeleton is complete and reflexes are present at 42 days.  ' Electrical brain wave patterns can be recorded at 43 days. This is usually ample evidence that 'thinking' is taking place in the brain.  ' The fetus has the appearance of a miniature baby, with complete fingers, toes and ears at 49 days.  ' All organs are functioning'stomach, liver, kidney, brain'and all systems are intact at 56 days.  ' By 20 weeks, the unborn child has hair and working vocal cords, sucks her thumb, grasps with her hands and kicks. She measures 12 inches.'(3)  Your last point about healthy sets doesn't have to do with ethics but I would like to see a test where they eat a doctors alloted mount of meat and healthy vegetables because the average American is a meat eater and the average American is obese so that test doesn't really work.  My conclusion  Eat meat there is nothing unethical about it.  It is a great source of protein.  And it tastes darn good and just the fact that eating a nice steak can make a good day for someone that's proof enough for me that it's a good thing.</t>

<t>Ecological  You state, “1st water is a renuable resource and we shouldn't worry about whether or not it takes more water for a cow then wheat, because it is all going to be renewed and if we chose not to eat those cows they would consume more water to live longer. “  Believe it or not, water usage is a concern. Though fresh water is replenished by the water cycle we have a limited amount at a given time and it takes vast amounts of energy (non-sustainable) to treat the water. In 50 years, our population will increase by 3 billion people. It will become increasingly difficult to provide water for everyone.  You can read about it here: http://www.whyzz.com...  Also, you say that if we didn't eat the cows, they would consume the water anyway. The meat industry breeds these animals in MASSIVE quantities. They are forced to reproduce much more frequently than if they were wild. If we stopped breeding them for slaughter their numbers would decrease dramatically in a few years. Also, you did not consider that meat production not only takes the water the animals drink directly, but all the water it takes to grow the food they eat.  You state that if we all switch to eating plants, we would decrease the world plant population and thus decrease the oxygen on earth. Most of the plants farmers grow are fed to meat animals. If we switched to plant diets there would be more plants, and, according to you, more oxygen. http://www.news.cornell.edu......  About global warming, if you don't believe it is a concern, I'm not sure what to tell you. You might consider having a look at some of these articles: http://www.huffingtonpost.ca...http://www.independent.co.uk... Animal Rights  You state: “Next I would like to say why animal rights shouldn't be a question. If you are an evolutionist you believe in survival of the fittest and that the better smarter species will weed out the lesser species, yes of course now days we try and keep a couple around but working against extinction of animals is very condridicting if your an evolutionist. “  Evolution is not a philosophy, it is a scientific concept. Survival of the fittest is not a code of conduct for life, it was never intended to be that. Evolution does not define morality.  Just because something behaves a certain way in nature does not make it ethical (e.g. causing other species' extinction).  97% of scientists accept evolution as scientific truth. This does not change what is ethical. http://www.people-press.org... I want to bring to attention that this is not a religious debate. It is a debate on ethics, which to some people does include religion, so I will address it briefly.   I am a protestant Christian and I think that evolution is probably true. I don't see a conflict between Christianity and evolution. God has the power to bring about life on earth in the way he chooses. I believe this way to be evolution. All the life on earth shares some percentage of DNA. This makes sense if you believe they come from the same Creator.  You mention that the Bible gives authority to man to rule over the creatures of the Earth. Does this mean we can do whatever we want to them? No, we must take care of them. Before the flood, God forbade the eating of meat. After the flood, he designated certain animals as “clean” to eat. Does this remove our responsibility to rule over the creatures with respect?  Here are some other things the bible has to say: 'The wolf and the lamb will feed together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox, but dust will be the serpent's food. They will neither hunt nor destroy on all my holy mountain,' says the LORD.” -Isaiah 65:25 “The godly care for their animals, but the wicked are always cruel. “ - Proverbs 12:10  “Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain. “ -Deuteronomy 25:4  “But ask the animals, and they will teach you, or ask the birds of the air, and they will tell you. Speak to the earth, and it will teach you, or let the fish of the sea tell you. Every one of these knows that the hand of the Lord has done this. The life of every creature and the breath of all people are in God’s hand.” -Job 12:7-10 (NCV)   Many early Christians were vegetarian, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, John Chrysostom, and Basil the Great to name a few. In some early church writings, Matthew, Peter and James (Brother of Jesus and first leader of the New Jerusalem Church) were all vegetarian. Clement wrote, 'It is far better to be happy than to have your bodies act as graveyards for animals. The Apostle Matthew partook of seeds, nuts and vegetables, without flesh'.   God giving us dominion over the animals does not give us license to mistreat them. God rules over us, and he is merciful to us. We rule over the creatures of the earth, should we not be merciful?    I do not think we should give rice plants rights. We only share 15% of our DNA with it. Plants have no brain, no central nervous system. There is no reason to think that plants have emotion or feel pain.There is a reason to think animals have emotion and feel pain. Animals are closer to us than plants, some animals are very close to us. Even bacteria share about 2% of our DNA. Does this give them rights? No. When you wash your hands, you kill thousands of bacteria. If you have ever felt pain, than you can surely understand why we should hesitate to inflict pain on the things that can feel it (animals, not plants and bacteria).  I agree with you about abortion. For the same reasons I think we should not kill animals, I feel we should not kill unborn humans. But this debate isn't about abortion.  Human Consumption  I'm not sure what you are saying about the health implications of a vegetarian diet. 8 years more of life is 8 years more of life. To me, that indicates it is healthy to be a vegetarian. Yes, there are many healthy, long-lived people who eat meat, but a diet without meat can be just as healthy (or possibly more-so). http://www.huffingtonpost.com......  You conclude: “Eat meat there is nothing unethical about it.”  18,000 children die every day for lack of food. If the entire nation switched to a completely plant-based diet, there would be 5 times more protein food than the meat produced. We feed farm animals enough to feed 800,000,000 people every year. This world needs all the extra food it can get. http://usatoday30.usatoday.com... “And it tastes darn good and just the fact that eating a nice steak can make a good day for someone that's proof enough for me that it's a good thing.“  Well, maybe punching my neighbor in the nose would “make a good day” for my neighbor's ex-wife, but that doesn't make it ethical.  Note: I apologize if my arguments seem a little strong, I'm just trying to present the situation as accurately as I can.</t>

<t>Topic:A vegetarian diet is more ethical than a meat-eating diet. I'll take on the Pro position of the debate, meaning I'll argue for vegetarianism.Definitions:A vegetarian is someone who does not eat any meat or fish, but does not necessarily abstain from eating animal derivatives like eggs and milk.By 'ethical' I mean morally right (as opposed to wrong) conduct. This includes examining the issue from both ecological and animal rights standpoints, as well as the implications to us as humans.By a 'meat-eating' diet, we'll just assume the average U.S. consumer (rather than a strict organic meat-eating person). Rules:1. This first round is just for acceptance, please do not begin with your argument.2. Please cite your sources.

<t>Overpopulation is the root of many political conflicts and virtually all environmental problems. Aside from avoiding nuclear war, lowering the human population needs be set as a top priority. The limits of the human population are debatable, but the repercussions of having more then 7 billion humans inhabit the planet are not. One could argue that the issue at hand isn't the current population per se, but rather, it is the exponential growth of the human population that is a cause for concern. Data suggests that the world population grows by two percent each year. Some speculate that another two billion will be added to the world population by the year 2030. This rate of growth is far beyond reasonable. Overcrowding in poorer nations can cause countless immigrants to flee to many western nations as well. This is a large factor in the growth of richer nations as well. For example, the U.S. population will grow by over 100 million by year 2050. Either way, overpopulation has played the leading role throughout history in famine, warfare, political organization, political disorganization and arguably countless other social problems.  The conflicts that arise from overpopulation are often very obvious. For example, the spread of disease is magnified by a dense population; overcrowding invariably leads to territorial disputes; and in order for a society to maintain sustainable consumption rates of natural resources, higher populations require lower per-capita consumption rates. Problems such as climate change, pollution, and soil erosion can all be attributed to the fact that the number of humans far exceeds this planets capacity.  Logic would state that any given population should be able to survive solely off of their natural, immediate environment, and in the case that required resources or an abundant food supply is not readily available, the group may migrate, in the best interest of survival, to another region in order to meet their needs.  Possibly one of the largest contributing factors, however, is the overproduction of food. After the birth of agriculture, the ability to produce food outgrew the need, and the overabundance of it led to an intense population explosion. Overproduction of food allows for more people to be born and, therefore, allows for a greater population. Human population growth is a rapidly cycling positive feedback loop in which food availability drives population growth. Some suggest that advancement in medical science is the greatest influence over the population. Medical science and technology greatly affect the mean life expectancy, but play a small part in the population equation.  No matter what the definitive cause, the Earth simply cannot sustain more then 7 billion humans. If humans are to survive on this planet, we need to drastically begin to reduce our population. Coupled with conservation efforts and the spread of environmental awareness, we might stand a chance, but overpopulation is nothing short of a crisis, and needs to be addressed with urgency.</t>

<t>I would like to thank my opponent’s response.   Rebuttals:   1. First, consensus is irrelevant to science. Galileo opposed consensus, Einstein opposed consensus. As Einstein noted, it only took one person, one paper, to disprove his theory. Further, getting a mere list actually does not represent the opinion of climate scientists. Other scientists are irrelevant (except geologists and meteorologists). The majority of debate only happens in political literature, not scientific literature. There is actually a consensus in favor of global warming. No major scientific organization opposes man-made global warming. 97% of climate scientists say global warming is man-made. Although this point is mainly irrelevant, the opposite of my opponents argument is true [1]. 2. Long term trends cannot be decided in 15 years. Richard Muller, former skeptic, website notes, “Some people draw a line segment covering the period 1998 to 2010 and argue that we confirm no temperature change in that period. However, if you did that same exercise back in 1995, and drew a horizontal line through the data for 1980 to 1995, you might have falsely concluded that global warming had stopped back then. This exercise simply shows that the decadal fluctuations are too large to allow us to make decisive conclusions about long term trends based on close examination of periods as short as 13 to 15 years.”[2] Many temperature datasets do not include the Arctic where it has been warming. Studies accounting for many factors, such as the 1998 El Nino, and others, conclude the earth is still warming at the same rate it was in the 1990s [3]. 3. Stopping global warming and its effects on the economy are irrelevant to what causes the warmth. This is totally irrelevant in this debate.   Case 1. Many studies indicate the overall human impact on global warming is far greater than the natural impact, interestingly many natural impacts are having a cooling effect on the warming. Teet et al. 2000 finds human activity caused over 100% of the warming from 1940 – 1997. How do you get 100%? Natural forcing’s causing a cooling effect, meaning we reversed those factors and caused warming. Meehl et al. 2004 finds humans caused 80% of the warming in the last century. Stone et al. 2007 found we caused almost 100% of the warming in the last 60 years. In a second paper, he noted humans caused 50% of the warming, the other half displaced by areosols, and the sun and volcanoes were responsible for 13 and 37% of the warming. Lean and Rind 2008 finds humans have caused 80% of the modern warming. Sott et al. used the same approach of Lean and Rind, but finds humans have caused 86% of the global warming. Huber and Knutti 2011 finds humans have caused 75-100% of the modern global warming. Foster and Rhmstorf 2011 finds that humans have caused 100% of the warming in the last 60 years. Gillet et al. 2012 finds we caused over 100% of the modern warming, as it had to overstep cooling effects and cause warming, making it over 100% [4]. 2. The sun, what my opponent argues causes global warming, is not the cause of modern warming. Sun Spots, overall, have no trend proving they likely do not cause the modern warming phase. The current sun spot number is like it was in 1913, when it was very cold, unlike this year, again showing the sun- not a candidate for modern warming [5]. 3. Scientific bodies have ruled out natural factors, man-made theory is the only possible thing left. Conclusion: Humans are the cause of global warming. </t>

<t>Thank you Pro for accepting this debate.  I believe global warming is not real and any temperature change is caused by the sun. I have three main points to back my argument.  1. People believe in global warming because political figures do 2. The earth is cooling 3. 'Global Warming' hurts jobs  1. My sources say that the majority of scientists studying climate change will say that global warming is not true. About 17,000 scientists agree with the fact that it is not true. How can we possibly agree with something that is not proven by fact? The reason people believe that global warming is true is because major political figures believe it and say it is true. Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Al Gore, and many others are examples of my point. The fact is people believe this because people they trust believe, not because of fact.  2. In the last ten years the earth has gone from warming to cooling. The global temperatures are expected to decline for the next two decades. This does not need very much arguing because it is backed by pure fact.  3. If we continue to believe global warming as a society, we will lose millions of jobs and be less energy efficient. If we cannot use oil, cannot use coal, and cannot use nuclear power, how do you expect any country to be energy efficient? You can't. Without these ways of producing energy, America will lose jobs and we will be forced to find new methods of energy which will cost billions.  I believe I have proved my points and I await pro's case.  Sources: http://www.aproundtable.org... http://www.forbes.com...</t>

<t>Refutations:  1. You just countered your own argument. You said that the number of scientists does not matter yet you argue that because more scientists agree with global warming it is true. In fact more scientists actually agree with me, your source is not reliable. You also dodged the majority of my argument. My point was people believe what political figures tell them to. My argument was not pure fact like yours.....  2. Just because I said it is PREDICTED that the earth would continue cooling does not mean that was my entire argument. Yes I did say that, but people that believe in global warming say the earth will continue getting 'warmer' It is called argument anticipation. My main argument was that the earth is getting colder by temperature change that we have observed and experienced. You dodged most of my argument because you cannot argue with fact.  3. If we continue to believe in global warming then we will lose jobs. I think that the effects of the belief would go with the debate so I would say you dodged this argument as well.  To counter your case I will say that I can get a bunch of sources to back my opinion too but that does not make a case, or a debate. You should get some actual arguments instead of plain sources because that is not what debating is. You use sources to back your arguments not the other way around.  As my main points were either halfway refuted or ignored completely, I will not be providing new points and I ask voters to give arguments to me for a poor case on pro.</t>

<t>My opponent has argued that the moderate to poor correlation of CO2 is enough to be considered major, however this is illogical. First, I never said CO2 had no effect, I argued it was not the main cause. Second, it is unlikely increasing CO2 has a large impact because CO2 increases are logarithmic, in other words the more CO2 there is the less warming effect each unit has. If we double the amount of CO2 from pre-industrial levels (we have gone through 30-50% increase) then warming per I increase would be extremely small. A 20 ppm increase of CO2 would be much less then 0.2 degrees Celsius [1]. Second, the climate is not very sensitive; a better way to put it would be an increase in CO2 would have little effect. The evidence claiming climate to be sensitive are very flawed, they ignore climate feedbacks and other factors relating to sensitivity. If CO2 were to double, only a 1 degree increase would occur, we have not doubled CO2 levels from the pre-industrial era and have warmed less then one degree Celsius. With current emissions it is unlikely we could argue CO2 is the main driver of climate change, when sensitivity is taken into account [2].  Second, my opponents rebuttal to the PDO and AMO argues the correlation is due to the seas space, however he ignores the fact the PDO and AMO go into cooling cycles and the correlation I cited showed when they cooled, the earth cooled, and in a warming phase the land warmed. Dr. Roy Spencer has argued the PDO may cause three quarters of the current warming due to its effects on clouds (therefore our albedo) winds, and obviously tropical winds. And it heats the pacific, obviously warming the earth in that way too. Spencer has argued, 'mankind's CO2 emissions are not strong enough to have caused the global warming we've seen over the last 100 years.' And that 'Here I present new evidence that most of the warming could be the result of a natural cycle in cloud cover forced by a well-known mode of natural climate variability: the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). While the PDO is primarily a geographic rearrangement in atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns in the North Pacific, it is well known that such regional changes can also influence weather patterns over much larger areas, for instance North America or the entire Northern Hemisphere (which is, by the way, the region over which the vast majority of global warming has occurred).[emphasis added]'[3] For my opponents argument to work, he would need to prove the PDO and other currents would only affect the regional areas (as he argued with his map). However, the cloud cover changes caused by the PDO would change the earths albedo and cause warming for the entire northern hemisphere, and as he noted that's where the warming is primarily occurring.  1. Global warming is real and is a threat  My opponent has argued this warming is unusually fast, which is interesting, as I have argued above that warming has stopped in recent years. With the stop of warming in recent years, it is odd to argue it is rising unusually fast. Models have overestimated the effect of CO2, claiming over the last 15-20 years the warming should have increased'a lot'however the warming has stopped [4]. The earth has actually been significantly warmer throughout its time period, when comparing us to other time periods in geologic history we are in an ice age. According to the 1995 IPCC report, our warming as been extremely insignificant and fairly normal. Climate geologists, generally, oppose climate alarmism. Many of the most well known geologists have argued the current warming is 'right on schedule'. Nothing about our warming is odd, different, or one of a kind [5].  The sea level raises my opponent points too are exaggerated. There is vast evidence that sea level rise is meager to nonexistent. A 2003 study finds sea level rise has only been about .5 mm a year, half of what my opponent has argued. A 2004 study finds before 1940, sea level rise was about 1mm per year'my opponent's number'but finds there has been no sea level increase (overall) after that date. Another 2004 study found, when you averaged the whole 20th century, we get 1.8mm rise per year, but when you break it into chunks (1950-2000) no sea level rose in that time period. And yet another 2004 study finds that the sea level increase is overall uncertain. They note in their study they believe sea level has risen 2 mm per year, however they failed to control for regional variability. They said their study answers many questions and creates many more, and conclude one cannot conclude anything. A 2005 study finds no increase in sea levels since 1950. And the list continues, the evidence that sea level rise is meager is growing [6].  My opponent has admitted no increase of hurricanes was argued. In other words, even if intensity increases but the number falls, we are left with a wash. However, even the intensity argument fails. Pro argues my data is incomplete'focusing on landfall hurricanes'although that's what really matters (or at least matters more) then sea hurricanes, his argument still falls when I extend the data set. So let me again note: the number of hurricanes overall has fallen, and my opponent overall drops that point. Many studies project a 5% increase in hurricane intensity, however a 2005 study (although concluding higher intensity) says that number is twice as high as it should be. Other studies have found intensity to be the same or actually decrease. The 2005 study agreeing with my opponent, in a way, argues reducing CO2 emissions (which would occur by using green energy as the resolution states) would not change Hurricane intensity. A 2006 study finds there is no correlation between global warming and wind speeds in Hurricanes. A second 2006 study replicates the results, arguing there is no current correlation between Hurricane intensity and warming. Multiple 2007 and 2008 studies replicate these findings, arguing 'if there is an increase in hurricane activity connected to a greenhouse gas induced global warming, it is currently obscured' (Chylek, P. and Lesins 2008) and that 'no evidence that the distributional mean of individual storm intensity, measured by storm days, track length, or individual storm power dissipation index, has changed (increased or decreased) through time.' (Briggs 2008) [7]. The evidence is pretty compelling: no Hurricane intensity changes have occurred. Remember: this is using non-landfall data too (making my opponents objection refuted). And there is some evidence that global warming reduces the total number of hurricanes meaning an overall decrease of extreme weather occurs.  My opponent plays semantics. In this debate climate change, as implied in round one, is global warming. The dust bowl, as I argued, was caused by farming and not a warming earth. Therefore, his objection is irrelevant. A drought in the 16th century has been deemed a mega drought by a 2000 study. It was the largest drought in human history, before humans could have caused it. Droughts within the last 1000 years are much more severe then now, and a 1998 study noted there was a decrease of droughts in the 20th century. Warming has no correlation with droughts, however overall sun intensity (which, sometimes, means warming may correlate with droughts) and regional warming from the suns rays caused droughts, not human processes [8]. Hunnington (2006) has pointed out rainfall globally has been increasing. Many studies have concluded rainfall will increase because of global warming; plant growth will increase, decreasing the possibility of a drought [9].  2. Caused by humans  My opponent uses flawed data, my data was 60 million years ago, and my opponent has used data from the creations, 5-6 million years before. As CO2 naturally fluctuates with climate change'climate change often causes more CO2'it would not be unheard of for the ppm levels to be close too, or far from, other dates. My opponent also falsely correlated CO2 with temperature; by arguing it cannot be that close, the Cambrian was warmer. As stated, the historical correlation between CO2 and temperature is nonexistent, with CO2 lagging temperature or not correlating at all. The CO2 was 2000-3000 ppm 60 mya, by measuring oxygen isotopes. This data is impeccable, and my opponents Cambrian objection makes little sense, its not odd that CO2 was not much lower at this time period, as CO2 and temperature historically don't correlate well his Cambrian objection is a weak one [10].  My opponent really doesn't refute my lagging argument, only posts links. Those links only talk about modern temperature trends, meaning source seven stands. And when looking at data millions of years ago, it won't matter if the study was published in 1999 or 2012. But if date is what he wants, recent papers back my findings too [11].  3. Fixing the problem  The resolution is in present tense, so saying 'it will get better later' is against the wording of the resolution. However, lets refute the 'future' argument. It is impossible to replace fossil fuels with green energy, New York would need 60 square miles of wind turbines and the wind to be blowing 100% of the time to power the city. Wind power has always been more expensive then fossil fuels, and new research has still failed to fix that problem. Bio fuels and other sources are quite inefficient and waste other resources in the process. Current renewable are a joke, and billions (if not trillions) of dollars are needed to make them competitive, which is not worth the cost, especially as I argued warming may help humans and more CO2 = more plants. Green energy is not a logical solution [12]. If the Kyto agreement would not stop warming, and is only a first step, converting to green energy would likely have no effect [5]. Further, photovoltaic's are inefficient, and uncompetitive [6].  4. Extinctions  First, CO2 is not a pollutant, meaning his position is illogical here.  Second, mass extinctions are not occurring. A 2009 study notes, ''after five years, a re-visitation of the summit areas revealed a considerable increase of species richness at the upper alpine and subnival zone (10% and 9%, respectively) and relatively modest increases at the lower alpine zone and the treeline ecotone (3% and 1%, respectively).' In addition, with respect to threats of extinction, they reported that 'during the last five years, the endemic species of the research area were hardly affected,' while 'at the highest summit, one endemic species was even among the newcomers.'[14]  As we can see, animals are not being affected by warming.  CONCLUSION:  Global warming is (1) exaggerated, (2) not man made, (3) fixing it is impossible, and would not help anyone, and (4) extinctions are a widely popularized myth that has been refuted.  http://www.debate.org...</t>

<t>I would like to thank jh1234l for this great debate. CO2 CorrelationFirst, what my opponent seems to fail to take into account, is that the Earth is in the middle of a 30-year cooling trend.  'Because PDO cycles last 25 to 30 years, Easterbrook expects the cooling trend to continue for another 2 decades or so.  Easterbrook, in fact, documents 40 such alternating periods of warming and cooling over the past 500 years, with similar data going back 15,000 years.  He further expects the flipping of the ADO to add to the current downward trend.'[1]Then why was 2010 the hottest year ever?'The 'hottest year' claims confirm the case for political science overtaking climate science. The “hottest year” claim depends on minute fractions of a degree difference between years. Even NASA's James Hansen, the leading proponent of man-made global warming in the U.S., conceded the 'hottest year' rankings are essentially meaningless. Hansen explained that 2010 differed from 2005 by less than 2 hundredths of a degree F (that's 0.018F).'[2]'There has now been no net warming since 1997 -15 years with CO2 rising with no global temperature increase. Since 2003, the trend is negative.'[3]And a graph:  [4]Second, my opponent provides this way out of whack graph, even though I have posted many graphs accurately showing the correlation between solar activity and temperature. I'm not to be mean and provide a new argument, so I will simply leave the audience with something to consider: Remember the laws of thermodynamics. Even if the sun's activity has leveled off, there will still be increases in temperature for a short while because the sun is still producing more energy. Sun      For my opponent's first point, I would like to thank him for conceding that the sun's activity is decreasing also, further supporting the conclusion that the Earth is cooling, which I mentioned above. Also, this further disproves the idea of CO2 causing global warming becuase CO2 concentrations are continuing to go up exponentially. (Also, I realize this might be in contradiction with my earlier point, but I encourage readers to look at overall levels, and the fact that the MWP was longer than this time's warming). As for my opponent's second point, he hasn't proven anything wrong because your graph doesn't show correlation at all. In addition, he drops ALL the other stellar data I provided in the last round.     Cosmic Rays My opponent has provided no rebuttal to my cosmic ray point; all he has done is make another claim about CO2's causation of the current warming. I will simply provide a short rebuttal and a graph.     [5]There is clearly not that much correlation, especially today when temperatures are decreasing.Now on to a research paper on the topic:The highlights of the paper are:  ► Changes in global atmospheric CO2 are lagging about 11–12 months behind changes in global sea surface temperature, 9.5-10 months behind changes in global air surface temperature, and 9 months behind changes in global lower troposphere temperature. ► Changes in ocean temperatures appear to explain a substantial part of the observed changes in atmospheric CO2 since January 1980. ► CO2 released from use of fossil fuels have little influence on the observed changes in the amount of atmospheric CO2, and changes in atmospheric CO2 are not tracking changes in human emissions.[6]Once more, my opponent has failed to respond to my arguments on cosmic rays.   PDO/AMO  My opponent is claiming that I have not provided a '10 year correlation record of PDO/AMO', although I'm sure I have in the numerous graphs and quotes I've made on this topic.I'll provide another graph:[7]As we can see, there is extremely large correlation, and that the sun spot number and climate is extremely correlated. And when broken into the last century, has a stronger correlation then CO2. PDO is also considered a large factor in the current warming, and its statistical correlation is extremely high and should never be considered unworthy as a component in warming [8].The facts where presented, the current correlation since 1880 was not strong enough to mean CO2 was a large factor, as it was under a .5 R correlation. The PDO (a natural forcing) had higher correlations by factors of two. Position in Galaxy  I would like to thank my opponent for presenting the whole quote, but it does not help his case one bit. My opponent can obviously not see that this was a point agreed upon by the creators of that article. Notice that 'militants' say, not ISIL. What ISIL says is: 'To put it another way, the amount of CO2 in our atmosphere is the result of changes in solar activity, not the cause of it. Climate change is natural, continuous, and caused by changes in solar emissions.'[9]Obviously, my opponent misread my quote. Now I will post the very last thing on cosmic rays: The following table sets out a comparison of the predictions of two climate theories - the CO2 warming theory and the Sun/Cosmic Ray theory - and actual real world data.

In other words, very reliable. I also provided ice core and tree ring data which are also very reliable. These are certainly worthy statistics and my opponent has dropped them. The Sun     I already countered all of this earlier.  Also, 'Temperatures have been increasing since 1980 faster than can be explained by the sunspot cycle length, indicating a possible human CO2 contribution. The recent increase of the cycle lengths explains why there has been no warming since 2002. Temperature changes are expected to follow Sun activity changes due to a time lag resulting from the large heat capacity of the oceans.'[10]Conclusion   'Just how much of the 'Greenhouse Effect' is caused by human activity?    It is about 0.28%. [11] Thanks again to my opponent for the debate. </t>

<t>Thanks to Ron-Paul for the response.  CO2 Correlation  The sunspots actually rose after the temperature in 1960, according to the chart from [A]. If my opponent's claim is right, then global warming causes sunspots to rise, which is not the case. The chart from [A] shows a strong correlation between CO2 and temperature, in the short term without apparent lag.  Sun  'Sun - Recent Activity Highest in 8000 Years and magnetic field has decreased in size by 25%'  Again, my sun argument still stands. Predictions say that Solar Cycle 24 will have a peak sunspot number of 90, the lowest of any cycle since 1928 when Solar Cycle 16 peaked at 78. Right now, the solar cycle is in a valley--the deepest of the past century. In 2008 and 2009, the sun set Space Age records for low sunspot counts, weak solar wind, and low solar irradiance. The sun has gone more than two years without a significant solar flare. [B] The sun is not in a period of high activity.  'Also, by the way, since CO2 does not correlate with temperatures, your Pluto-to-Earth claim is fallacious.'  I have proven this wrong with [A].  Cosmic Rays  The most recent IPCC studies disputed the mechanism. The 2007 IPCC reports, however, strongly attribute a major role of anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the ongoing global warming, but as 'different climate changes in the past had different causes' a driving role of carbon dioxide in the geological past is neither focus of the IPCC nor purported. [C]  PDO/AMO  The 10-year correlation record of CO2 is on there, but the 10 year correlation record of PDO/AMO is not on there, therefore this does not prove that CO2 has less influence.  'There. Cosmic rays, the sun, and all the Earth's natural cycles have a .95 correlation. '  The PDO/AMO does not have a 10 year chart to compare with CO2, the sun is refuted in earlier rounds. The sunspots are lagging behind the temperature. IPCC disputes the cosmic rays and instead attribute the warming to CO2.  Position in galaxy (Only a chart given by opponent)  Per Ron-Paul's request, this is the full quote: (formatting changed for character count, no changes in content, words taken out in R3 are marked) ' To combat global warming, militants say we must all accept drastic reductions in our standard of living starting now, steadily increasing year-after-year, until much of industrial society is swept away. Only thus can the earth, and perhaps mankind, be saved. [[To achieve this radical restructuring of human society, global warming proponents demand that we give virtually unlimited power to government to control what we eat, how we travel, and how our industries operate, with no dissent or resistance permitted.]] Cars, jet travel for the public, air conditioning, refrigeration, and indeed many if not most of the conveniences of modern life will simply have to be abolished, as quickly as politically feasible. As one environmental activist puts it, Everything modern has to go!' -ISIL  Medieval Warm Period  'I will keep coming with more. There is a clear correlation.' There is no correlation if you give nothing to compare.  The data before 1600 was scarce [D], which means that the temperatures can be colder or warmer than now, but the chart at [E] shows that the MWP is colder than the temperature at 2004.  The Sun  Back in 2008, the solar cycle plunged into the deepest minimum in nearly a century. Sunspots all but vanished, solar flares subsided, and the sun was eerily quiet. As 2011 unfolds, sunspots have returned and they are crackling with activity. On February 15th and again on March 9th, Earth orbiting satellites detected a pair of 'X-class' solar flares--the most powerful kind of x-ray flare. The last such eruption occurred back in December 2006. [F]  As you can see, the solar activity was unstable. Then we should see many huge dips and rises in the chart at http://ossfoundation.us... , but the sun spots dipped down in 2000, while the temperature still rose with the CO2 with little to none delays on the CO2 part. CO2 correlates more than sun spots on [A]. And [A] is a short term graph from 1860 to 2000, so the CO2 should be delayed like crazy, right? Nope, that is not the case.  In Conclusion, my opponent's claims have been refuted.</t>

<t>My thanks to my opponent for the debate, and I look forward to a fascinating dialogue. I must apologise for the poor quality of my response; I managed to misplace my AlphaSmart and shall be unable to locate it until Monday at the soonest.  Firstly, I would like to ask my opponent for his sources; I am unable to locate the BBC article and the only Martin Anthony I could find teaches at the London School of Economics and Political Science.  Note that Con's arguments will be labeled C1, C2, C3, etc.; mine will be labeled P1, P2, P3, etc.  C1: The EPA does not only deal with climate change. It also deals with endangered species (though not to a great extent), hazardous waste disposal, and non-climate related pollution[1]. Furthermore, the efficiency of the EPA is irrelevant to a debate as to the moral obligation to mitigate climate change, unless it is showed to be common to all attempts to deal with climate change.  C2: The greenhouse effect is well supported[2]. We emit greenhouse gases. If we stop emitting greenhouse gases, and even possibly start removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, then logically this would reduce the greenhouse effect, lowering the amount by which the world warms.  P1: The Maldives are currently trying to buy land in other countries, as they expect to be underwater if nothing is done about global warming. If they do purchase land (in, for instance, Australia, which is one of their potential targets), then they shall definitely cause a problem as they, and the country surrounding them, adjust to having another sovereign country in the middle of them. Not to mention the possibility that some people living there might not take kindly the Maldives moving in.[3][4] </t>

My opponent stated in his last speech that the United States is not included as a developed country. Wikipeidia confirms that the United States is a developed country. My opponent also stated that my point on the EPA is irrelevant, This point is completely relevant because it is a organization funded by a developed nation which has come up with no successful solutions to climate change. My opponent has also not attacked my second contention so I assume that my opponent has accepted that developed nations have other bigger priority's. My opponent stated in his first speech that greenhouse gases are hurting the environment. If these gases are so harmful, how come there is no law banning them? Why are they still being pumped into the atmosphere? I would also like to pull through my point on NASA ( climate.NASA.org) stating that climate change is a natural cause.

<t>I accept and I thank my opponent for setting up this debate. Let's get down to business.Resolution'The world is over populated'I will be arguing against this resolution. Therefore, to win all I must do is show that the world is not overpopulated.Burden of ProofPro will have the burden of proof as he is putting forth the positive claim.DefinitionsWorld: EarthOverpopulated: The population of an area in too large numbers -----Since Pro has made arguments in round one I assume that this round is for actual arguments and not just acceptance, so here we go.Counter Arguments1. Too many peoplePro claims that there are too many people, and this is just not the case. Every single person on Earth could fit into Texas and have a 66'x66' plot of land (enough for a single family home + yard) [1]. This would leave the entire rest of the inhabitable earth devoid of human life.2. Too few resourcesPro contends that there are too few resources, giving examples such as food and oil. In terms of food the problem isn't that there's too little food, it's that a select few groups of people are eating a disproportionate amount. Consider this; Americans, while only making up 5% of the worlds population, eat almost a quarter of all consumed food (24%). In fact, the average American consumes as much food as 370 Ethiopians. It's not just a matter of food consumed either. Americans throw out 200,000 tons (440,924,400 lbs) of edible food every day [2]. Consider also that less than half as many people die from famine each year now than a century ago, even though our population has quadrupled [4], and World agriculture produces 17 percent more calories per person today than it did 30 years ago, despite a 70 percent population increase [5].In terms of oil, we aren't even close to running out. The end of oil has been predicted for over 100 years now and year after year we see that our oil reserves are actually growing. In 1882 it was estimated that there was only 95 million barrels of oil remaining and that we would run out of oil before the end of the decade. By 1919 (37 years later) we still had oil and it was estimated that we would run out of oil in 20 years. By 1950 (31 years later), there was over 100 billion barrels of oil estimated on reserve. This cycle of people predicting the end of oil and oil reserves increasing has continued until today. Long story short, we now have estimated about 1.25 trillion barrels of oil remaining -- over 13,000x as much oil on reserve as was estimated in 1882 when the death of oil was first predicted [3]. I highly recommend checking out the rest of this video for those of you who want the rest of the figures given. 3. GarbageOnce again, this isn't an issue of numbers, but an issue of poor management. Consider this; 'Due to developments in waste management, the projected landfill waste for the United States (a relatively massive producer of waste) over the entire next century could be stored in a landfill area only 18 miles on each side.' [4].This landfill could even be reduced by upwards of 70% due to recycling [6]. So it's clear that trash is only as big of a problem as we let it be -- and even then how big of a problem it can be is exaggerated.Finally, it has not been established that humans are responsible for climate change. This needs to be established before I can be expected to debunk this claim. 4. Irrelevant ArgumentsThe rest of Pro's argument is about ways we can reduce our population and the projected benefits of a smaller population. There are numerous problems with what he's said, but there's no point in arguing about it because ultimately these things are irrelevant to both of our positions. All Pro needs to establish is that the world is overpopulated and all I need to do is refute his argument for that resolution. Questions of how to do deal with overpopulation are meaningless unless it is established that the world is overpopulated in the first place.ConclusionI've shown that in terms of land, oil and food, the world is not overpopulated nor is it even close to being as such. As it stands right now, Pro's BOP has not been fulfilled.I look forward to your response.</t>

<t>Aff Resolved: Developed countries have a moral obligation to mitigate the effects of climate change.  For the purpose of this debate I propose the following definitions. Developed countries is a term used to identify the wealthiest nations in the world, which include Western Europe, the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. (ww Norton amp; co. economics textbook) Moral obligation is a duty arising out of considerations of right and wrong (Princeton University)  For our framework, we will be using utilitarianism, which is that actions should be directed toward promoting the greatest happiness of the greatest number of persons. Specifically, according to utilitarian philosphers Peter Singer and Henry Sidgwick, 'there are moral assertions that we recognise intuitively as true... suffering is intrinsically bad, and... people's preferences should be satisfied.' To the topic, this means that mitigting the effects of climate change is neccessary for providing the greatest happiness to the most people.  Contention 1: Developed countries are largely responsible for climate change  It is common truth that industrialized nations bear more responsibility for human-induced climate change. This is because over the years, dating back to the Industrial revolution, humans have been producing greenhouse gases that have influenced Earth's atmosphere. As such it would be unfair to ask developing countries to act similarly as developed countries. 'When the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was formulated ... the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities was acknowledged. ... [T]his principle recognized that •The largest share of historical and current global emissions of greenhouse gases has originated in developed countries; •Per capita emissions in developing countries are still relatively low; •The share of global emissions originating in developing countries will grow to meet their social and development needs.'(The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) As a result, Today's developed nations are responsible for global warming and the effects of which we see today. And it is unfair to expect undeveloped world to make the same emissions reductions.  Contention 2: Developed countries are the only ones with the capabilities to act on climate change  No only do developed nation have the most to cut per capita, but they are also the only ones that have the technological advancements and resources to combat climate change. As such they have an obligation to use these resources to fix their planet. More importantly, the developed countries have the research capabilities to create the technology to make a green self-sustaining economy. For example, Italy for the first time has been able to utilize solar power to produce more electricity than wind power, thus accounting for nearly 3.2% of their total energy needs. In addition, by being at the forefront of this technology, Italy, a country constantly on the brink of economic disaster, has been able to become more stabilized and focus its energy on expanding its renewable energy market.(renewable energy world) Further, the developed world has the finance and expertise to develop these projects and implement and manage them all around the world. As the nations with the greatest capability, the developed world has the increased responsibility to act for the betterment of all.  Contention 3: The greatest impact will come when the largest emitters of greenhouse gases make reductions.  Developed countries emit the most greenhouse gases per capita, in 2008 the US emitted 17.9 tonnes compared to China's 5.3 tons per person. If reductions are made in such nations, then we will see a much bigger impact in the climate than if it came from developing nations. In addition, the developed countries with high CO2 emissions can reduce output through lifestyle changes. For example, biking to work instead of taking the car or cutting back on the junk food now and then. For developing nations, changes like that can not be made. They would have to change their entire economy and route to development to meat such needs even though they don't produce all that much in the first place. In the future, these developing nations will look to the actions of the developed world to plan for their future. By combating climate change, we ensure that everyone will eventually reach a point in which we can eliminate emissions all together.  In Conclusion Global warming is an outcome of human activities rather than a natural disaster. Without maximum action from the developed world, all countries will be ultimately affected, including the rich countries.</t>

<t>I would like to thank Numidious for accepting this debate. I. The Universe and Global WarmingThe current state of the Galaxy and our Sun is affecting our temperatures.I.i. The Rest of the Solar SystemThe Sun clearly is in a warmer phase, because all of the other planets have increasing temperatures as well. 'In 2005 data from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor and Odyssey missions revealed that the carbon dioxide 'ice caps' near Mars's south pole had been diminishing for three summers in a row.Habibullo Abdussamatov, head of space research at St. Petersburg's Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory in Russia, says the Mars data is evidence that the current global warming on Earth is being caused by changes in the sun.'[1]''Global warming on Neptune's moon Triton as well as Jupiter and Pluto, and now Mars has some [scientists] scratching their heads over what could possibly be in common with the warming of all these planets … Could there be something in common with all the planets in our solar system that might cause them all to warm at the same time?''[2] Two things can be drawn from this. One, that if other planets are warming, that it is only natural for the Earth to be warming as well. And second, that even if all these planets did have natural causes, then that is a sign of Earth's natural climatic change, instead of man-made. I.ii. The Position of the Milky Way GalaxyEvery approximately 135 million years, Earth enters a more populated area of the Milky Way, and as a result, more cosmic rays hit the Earth, which causes cooling. Currently, we are in a less populated area of the Milky Way, which means that less of these cosmic rays will be hitting the Earth, which means less cloud formation, and of course, warming. [3] for the source on this hypothesis. The sun can also cause this through evaporation.II. Earthly CausesThere are many internal causes of Global Warming as well. II.i. Ocean Current Anomalies Ocean temperature anomalies seem to be rising-along with the temperature. '...one can model past temperatures as a linear trend (that started well before CO2 was added in any substantial quantity) and periodic bumps... ...temperatures over the last 100+ years look a lot like a linear trend plus ocean cycle-driven bumps'[4] What is causing all the bumps?:  [4]  As shown in the graph, the PDO, or ocean currents, temperature has affected the average Earth's temperature.    II.ii. Clouds: A Continuation of Point I.ii.I mentioned about the position of the Milky Way Galaxy and the Sun in regards to these 'cosmic rays'. Here is a more in depth look at the effects of position. 'The implications, if true, had potentially enormous implications for the debate about natural causes of warming. When the sun is very active, it can be thought of as pushing away cosmic rays from the Earth, reducing their incidence. When the sun is less active, we see more cosmic rays. This is fairly well understood. But if Svensmark was correct, it would mean that periods of high solar output should coincide with reduced cloud formation (due to reduced cosmic race incidence), which in turn would have awarming effect on the Earth, since less sunlight would be reflected back into space before hitting the Earth.Here was a theory, then, that would increase the theoretical impact on climate of an active sun, and better explain why solar irradiance changes might be underestimating the effect of solar output changes on climate and temperatures.'[4]'Since he first suggested his hypothesis over a decade and a half ago, Svensmark and other researchers have slowly been putting together research to test it.' The results were: 'Scientists found that when shielding was removed and natural cosmic rays allowed to hit the chamber, cloud seeding increased dramatically, and it increased substantially again when additional artificial cosmic rays were added. Svensmark appears to have gotten it right.'[5] Proof here is in the next points. III. The 1500-Year Cycle This has to do with a cycle of the climate that can explain the warming. 'Through at least the last million years, a moderate 1500-year warm-cold cycle has been superimposed over the longer, stronger Ice Ages and warm interglacials.'[6]  Here is a graph related to this: [7]There are two things we can conclude from this graph. First, that up-and-down cycles are normal for the long-term climate. This century's global warming is nothing new. The second thing we can conclude, is that today's global warming is not as bad as the Medieval Warm Period's peak yet, and the Medieval Warm Period was less than the Holocene Maximum Period.    'Even more important, the earth is not 'the warmest it has ever been.' In fact, the earth was much warmer during the Medieval Warm Period when human agriculture flourished!'[7]'The scientists found evidence that on average, every 1,470 years, plus or minus 500 years, cold, ice-bearing waters, which today circulate around southern Greenland, pushed as far south as Great Britain.'[8] There seems to be a full cycle of up-down-up temperatures of the climate every 1470 years. And this goes as far back as at least 1 million years ago. Currently, we are in an upswing of temperatures, just coming off of the Little Ice Age, the peak to be in a few hundred years, making the peak-to-peak difference between today's global warming and the Medieval Warm Period a little less than 1500 years. So today's Global Warming is a natural, cyclical occurence.    IV. The Sun: The Proof of Theories I.ii and II.iiThe sun's cycles have a lot to do with temperatures also.  'In this chamber, 63 CERN scientists from 17 European and American institutes have done what global warming doomsayers said could never be done — demonstrate that cosmic rays promote the formation of molecules that in Earth’s atmosphere can grow and seed clouds, the cloudier and thus cooler it will be. Because the sun’s magnetic field controls how many cosmic rays reach Earth’s atmosphere (the stronger the sun’s magnetic field, the more it shields Earth from incoming cosmic rays from space), the sun determines the temperature on Earth.'[9]'Svensmark matched the data on cosmic rays from the neutron monitor in Climax, Colorado, with the satellite measurements of solar irradiance from 1970 to 1990. Over the period between 1975 and 1989, he found cosmic rays decreased by 1.2 percent annually, amplifying the sun's change in irradiance about four-fold'[6]So, as the sun's activity increases, so does the temperature. This below graph shows the correlation: [10] This graph clearly shows that temperature goes up and down with solar activity, because an increase in solar activity directly correlates with an increase in average temperature 1-2 years later. And as a final side note, I would like to present this graph that helps disprove the anthropogenic cause theory, regarding again, ocean temperature anomalies: [4]So 'nature' created the same temperature trend as 'humans' did. </t>

<t>Hello again, I appreciate my opponent's commitment also. The debate has been interesting, if long. Unfortunately my last response was somewhat incoherent towards the end - this is because it was written at a time when I should have been asleep...I. Find the Gases that Causes the Planet to Warm I am glad that my opponent does not refute this. However, what my opponent must mean by agreeing with it is that the greenhouse effect actually exists, as I explained. If the greenhouse effect exists, then enhancement of that effect must warm the planet! My opponent states later that 'carbon dioxide does not correlate with temperature very well,' but it must if he agree with these statements.II. Ensure that those Gases Enter and Remain in the Atmosphere in Greater (or Lesser) Quantities than Beforei. Methane I agree that, relative to the natural amount of methane entering the atmosphere, the human contribution is fairly small (20%). What my opponent does not realize is that this small change can have MASSIVE effects - the CO2 and Methane (and water vapour) that are in and are cycling through our atmosphere now have been keeping the planet warm for ages, and thank goodness for that as otherwise the average temperature on earth would have been at -18 degrees celsius, that's zero degrees fahrenheit for you Americans, otherwise known as enough for the surface of the planet to be solid ice!Now we know the effects of the amount we already have (from -18 to 14, or 0 to 57 in fahrenheit) just imagine what a slight, minor increase will do... Keeping in mind that the difference between now and the last ice age is just 5 degrees celsius, that's 10 fahrenheit.Methane warms the world '20 times faster than CO2' (1) and although it is only at 1/200th of the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere (and the increase is proportional to this) that still makes methane emissions responsible for 28% of current warming.My opponent's graph is correct, saying that in 2004 methane emissions were going down. Does that preclude the idea that methane caused warming in the years before 2004, or will again? The argument is fallacious in and of itself. Also, AFTER 2004 methane emissions began to increase again, shown here. This may be because methane was trapped in arctic ice, melted by global warming. A fact, by the way, that my opponent cannot dispute - to say that global warming is not happening wrecks his own arguments, to say that there is no natural gas/methane in arctic sea ice is to contradict accepted science.II.ii. CFCsOnce more my opponent asserts that because something will not happen in the future means that it is not happening in the present or did not happen in the past. CFCs, which are entirely human synthesized, are no longer in use. This is, as I mentioned earlier, a success. Since CFCs never had the chance to warm the planet too much (though they certainly damaged the ozone layer) I added them as an afterthought on how humans are capable of changing our planet.II.iii. Nitrous OxideMy opponent's reply here is similar to his on methane, and I give a similar response - small changes in the environment can have massive effects, and my evidence is the same as well - the temperature the planet would be at without the greenhouse effect. Nitrous oxide is particularly interesting in this case because it traps heat 300x as fast as carbon dioxide. This is a phenomenal amount, but since much less nitrous oxide ends up in the atmosphere every year than carbon dioxide, it remains a lesser contributor to warming.  My opponent asserts that cows reduce nitrous oxide in the atmosphere - but by how much? The reference my opponent provided was inconclusive at best.  iv. Carbon Dioxide  My opponent's assertion here that the troposphere is not warming is, unfortunately, incorrect, as this graph should exemplify.According to Science Daily, 'The troposphere, the lower part of the atmosphere closest to the Earth, is warming and this warming is broadly consistent with both theoretical expectations and climate models, according to a new scientific study that reviews the history of understanding of temperature changes and their causes in this key atmospheric layer.'My opponent claims that his graph 'disproves the greenhouse theory' but does not recognize that the natural greenhouse effect has been warming the planet for thousands of years - he is welcome to suggest that CO2 could come from another source than humans, but to say that the greenhouse effect does not exist contradicts this (5) this (6) and this (7) and many, many other sources. In fact, the greenhouse effect itself was known to be true long before global warming, in 1824 when Joseph Fourier first expained it. You have to wonder, where else would all the CO2 go? It doesn't just disappear!My opponent is self contradictory here, as in the same argument he concurs that carbon dioxide and other gases warm the atmosphere but denies that the greenhouse effect they create exists, and furthermore denies that adding any MORE carbon dioxide would warm the atmosphere to a greater extent!If one is to study my opponent's graph here more closely, one realizes that the ppm of carbon dioxide is increasing on this graph, and quite alarmingly. In a mere 30 years it increased by 30 ppm in our entire atmosphere! This is very alarming, especially considering what I mentioned earlier, the fact that the natural amount of ppm of carbon in our atmosphere has warmed the earth 60 degrees fahrenheit and 30 celsius! I repeat again as well that the difference between now and the last ice age was 6 degrees. Thus the temperature and the ppm shown here ARE correlated, and in a very alarming way.The next graph presented is in fact a clever trick - it focus only on minor temperature changes and not on the larger picture it merely sets the information so that the lines fit. It is true, as I have mentioned that the sun causes short term variations in temperature. However, here is a graph that shows OVERALL temperatures, and thus the long term correlation between CO2 and temperature. The next piece here (A 'cooling' arctic) is simply incorrect. I can show you better than explain, but here are a few quotes anyhow.'Since 1951 the arctic has warmed twice as much as the global average' (9)'The temperature in the arctic has gone up 1.5 degrees celsius, whereas the world has gone up 0.7 degrees.''Arctic's rapid temperature rise breaks records.' (10)'Last year NASA released reports showing arctic temperatures going beyond 2010 records.' (11)For my opponent's final point, he says that global warming causes rises in CO2 levels. How? The greenhouse effect has been established, and accepted by my opponent. If CO2 levels are a a lagging indicator, then how are 1960 - 1990 on these graphs explained?II.iv. Water VapourWhat my opponent does not realize here is that temperature rises cause water vapour to increase! Therefore a 1 degree celsius rise in temperature from CO2 causes a 3 degree rise from water vapour - thermal expansion means more water evaporates.No more space - one last graph.This explains the speed of current warming best.</t>

<t>I am here going to prove to the audience and to my opposition that global warming is primarily caused by homo sapiens and is thus a characteristic of the anthropocene - a term recently created by geologists to express 'the age of man.' I have yet to thorougly read my opponent's arguments, so anything that I write that may seem to be a rebuttal is pure coincidence. I thank my opponent for challenging me to this debate and hope for an interesting exchange of ideas. Either he'll learn something or I will!Three Steps to Damaging the Planet (Human Style)A) Find the gases that cause the planet to warmThe following gases contribute to the greenhouse effect...(10)Feedback GasesWATER VAPOURWater vapour is a 'feedback' to the climate rather than a cause of climate change. It is a greenhouse gas, but it does not contribute to a change in the greenhouse effect, rather, it changes with the temperature of the atmosphere, and thus acts as a way of telling if we're doing things right. Put simply, we on earth can't directly affect the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere, but more of it should tell us that the temperature of the planet is warming (because it evaporates. We can't heat the oceans by ourselves so we need something less direct.) and thus there's a cause - effect relationship - more CO2/Methane/etc. = Higher Temperaures = More Water VapourCausal GasesMETHANENot what you were expecting, right? But still very important. Most mammals have natural methane emissions of a kind, and this can change, so this will go into our recipe for messing with our climate. Naturally, however, it is emitted at 270 teragrams per year (9) Come back to this later.NITROUS OXIDEAlso causal to rather than resulting from a change in climate, that is, we can change how much goes into the atmosphere.CFCsThe same ones that destroy the ozone layer, this time, they're back to destroy the biosphere. I say 'destroy' because CFCs are as irrefutably man - made as CO2 and Methane are not, and therefore MUST be at least one reason that the atmosphere is warming. (Since they are artificial, to say that an increase in their quantity has non - anthropogenic causes would be like saying that trees can be made of plastic).CARBON DIOXIDEThe classic greenhouse gas. Carbon dioxide is absorbed to some extent in grass and trees (photosynthesis) on a natural level, and otherwise may be released through volcanoe and major forest fires, or the combustion of organic material. This usually accounts for 750 gigatons (8) of CO2 moving through the carbon cycle every year, not including human intervention.The gases listed here under causal warm the earth through the greenhouse effect. This is not controversial, here's how it works(7)The greenhouse effect, WITHOUT human intervention (except obviously in CFCs), is caused by the above gases in the above way. Now all we have to do is add a greedy, unenlightened species and we're on our way...B) Ensure that those gases enter and remain in the atmosphere in greater (or lesser) quantities than beforeMETHANEHumans add 330 teragrams per year (9) of methane to the atmosphere every year to the 270 teragrams already entering it, mostly through methane emitted by livestock (a single modern cow emits 270 kg of methane each year), from decay in landfills and from waste treatment, not to mention the burning of biomass. If the 330 teragrams going into the atmosphere WITHOUT humans every year causes 9% of the greenhouse effect, as noted above, then that amount doubling will, of course, ENHANCE the greenhouse effect, causing - global warming. The truth is that it would be strange if it DIDN'T. There are now 2 billion cows on the planet, far more than at any point in history. They, through methane emissions, are enhancing the greenhouse effect.CARBON DIOXIDEIt has been mentioned that 750 gigatons goes through the carbon cycle every year. Humans add 29 gigatons (8) - haha, the opposition says, the amount of human emissions of CO2 every year pale in compare to how much goes through the carbon cycle! But then one takes closer look - every year, 439 gigatons are released and 450 are absorbed by plants and trees. Suddenly, the 29 gigatons becomes much more frightening, especially when one observes that carbon dioxide is now at 390 ppm (parts per million) in the atmosphere, nearly twice as high as it has been for the last 500,000 years! The higher amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is also caused, of course, by the fact that our conversion of land for agriculture has led to land with plants that absorb less CO2 (virtually all my references will say this) so that the number of gigatons absorbed (450) is decreasing whilst the 29 is increasing, resulting in idle CO2 sitting around, warming up the atmosphere - as it must as a greenhouse gas.CO2 is poisonous as well, by the way, so even if my worthy opponent and/or audience leaves this debate with their minds unchanged on the topic of anthropogenic global warming, remember that there is still reason for CO2 emissions to be curtailed!CFCsThis is an optimistic part of the human - greenhouse effect story in that we actually stopped putting CFCs into the atmosphere when we realized how awful they were for the ozone layer. Therefore we do not put CFCs into the atmosphere any more - it's like a defunct greenhouse gas, in retirement.NITROUS OXIDENO2 has an atmospheric lifetime of 121 years (11) so naturally even a small amount of nitrous coming out of your exhaust enhances global warming for years to come. And when it's 110 to 240 thousand tonnes coming from car exhaust pipes every year, you know you have a problem. Add 2 to 4 million tonnes from fertilization practices in agriculture and you have a MAJOR problem! Add to this the fact that NO2 is 310 times as powerful as CO2 as a greenhouse gas and you have a full blown nightmare.Given the endless facts and evidence presented above, it would be strange if the atmosphere was NOT warming up from human intervention. The below only affirms what should be evident. On to our third and final step.C) Watch as the planet warms or cools six degrees, the difference between now and the last ice ageIt is often mentioned that the earth's climate has change in the past, and that is most assuredly true. It is also true, of course, that the earth's climate can change in the future, and for different reasons. However, what is unique about the warming of the anthropocene is that it has happened and is happening so suddenly, more suddenly than in the past. The closest example of climate change at this speed (just 120 years since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution), obviously excluding the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs, is the Palaeo - Eocene Thermal Maximum (13) about 55 million years ago, when the climate changed 5 to 8 degrees,that warming, of course, took several thousand years.</t>

<t>Global climate change according to me is manmade. Climate change or global warming, according to me, is here as a result of our misdeeds- like deforestation, burning of fossil fuels, emission of carbon dioxide and other harmful greenhouse gases. Forests have the ability to convert carbon dioxide into oxygen and we are removing them, throwing them out of our planet for our own betterment- for land, for fuel, for medicinal purposes and etc. While doing this we, knowingly or unknowingly, cut off the planet's "lungs". So as an answer to our deforestation, mother earth gives us GLOBAL WARMING! Mankind's burning of fossil fuels causes a warming tendency in the atmosphere- global warming. The mainly used fuel coal when burnt releases huge numbers of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere making it unfit to breathe in, and also causing greenhouse effect.It has now been proven that as a result to our blasting millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide has increased the temperature by 4 degree Celsius, since the 1950's. This increase in temperature is because of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (released by our activities) which trap heat and make the earth HOTTER. These greenhouse gases also deplete the ozone layer which protects us from harmful UV rays and the immense heat released by the sun. Now, this depletion has grown to such an extent that we have a hole in the ozone layer resulting in an increasing temperature. With reference to all the points I have mentioned above, I can conclude that GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE (GLOBAL WARMING) IS MANMADE!</t>

My first point is the irrefutable fact that climate change has occured before in history with no relation to humans and is sure to occure again. This is a point that all scientists agree with. There has been several periods of 'global warming' in our earth's history, namely the entire Jurassic period and the period in human history known as the middle ages, where the climate has been shown to have gone through similar motions as it is doing now. There was no human effect to cause this, it is merely a part of the natural rhythm of our planet. What is happening now is a stage in the rhythm of our planet that has been blown out of proportion by fear-mongering scientists and hippies.

<t>Natural cycles:This argument is about solar cycles (as well as other cycles). This is one of the more common arguments in the global warming debate. There are many longer solar cycles, but there are sometimes shorter ones (1500 years +/- 500). We are actually in an ice age, but a section called an interglacial. (like a temporary break). This is much of modern history, and in those 15,000 years it seems as though we have perfectly fit into this 1500 year cycle, and the funny thing is we are in the middle of the cycle as we speak. It will soon end, but this warming is expected. Now the significance to this cycle is it perfectly explains global warming, accelerated heating then cooling. [1] This perfectly explains the 'unprecedented' warming. Also:http://www.isil.org... (scroll down about halfway and see graph)Looks like a natural cycle to me, and very predictable. Furthermore:'In 2005 data from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor and Odyssey missions revealed that the carbon dioxide 'ice caps' near Mars's south pole had been diminishing for three summers in a row. Habibullo Abdussamatov, head of space research at St. Petersburg's Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory in Russia, says the Mars data is evidence that the current global warming on Earth is being caused by changes in the sun.' http://news.nationalgeographic.com... Another reason is the earths position in the milky way. Every 135 million years we enter a more populated area in the galaxy and hit more cosmic rays which make clouds, and therefore cooling. Currently we are in a les populated branch, and the less rays mean we will inevitably be warmer/warming. [2] Wind and ocean currents also play a LARGE role in heating/cooling. http://www.climate-skeptic.com...Sums it up. (scroll down to PDO warm and cool) Problems with the greenhouse theoryNow, we (If I decide to argue greenhouse) can attribute warming to other gases, and I still win the debate as I prove it not human CO2 enduced. In this contention I argue water vapor causes much of the warming. Basically to sum up what I would have said in many paragraphs:'However, the most potent greenhouse gas is water, explains Shaidurov and it is this compound on which his study focuses. According to Shaidurov, only small changes in the atmospheric levels of water, in the form of vapour and ice crystals can contribute to significant changes to the temperature of the earth's surface, which far outweighs the effects of carbon dioxide and other gases released by human activities. Just a rise of 1% of water vapour could raise the global average temperature of Earth's surface more then 4 degrees Celsius.'http://phys.org... Also if the theory was true, the north and south polls would be seeing increased meltings and be seeing large temperture spikes. I contend the pols have had little to no warming. I think this observation is common knowlege. More stuff'That means that less than 2/1,000 of all CO2 is produced by human activity. So even if we wiped out every car, power plant, jet liner, and human being from the face of the earth, there would be no noticeable effect on global CO2 levels.'http://www.isil.org... Further if CO2 was a climate factor, if we saw natural increases in CO2 there would also be natural rises in temperature hundreds of years ago, and there is no correlation, therefore the correlation fails on a scientific basis. Using figure 2.4 in source (2) we observe no statistical correlation, CO2 is low temperature may be high or vice versa. This right here disproves the theory. (If CO2 actually had an impact, natural increases would also raise temperature, it did not, hence it has no correlation)..Also CO2 lags temperture. If CO2 was a cause it would happen before the rise, hence even if it is a natural increase we should see an increase in temp, we dont, hence there is no correlation.

<t>I am going to try something that I have not done for a year. Instead of doing a specific line-by-line, I will be using this round to crystallize my position because I do not think that my opponent really made a substantive effort to attack my position in this round. That does mean that I am dropping anything; I will cover the flow as I tell the “story of the round”. Before I begin, however, I would like to address this argument that my opponent makes about 0.2% of the greenhouse effect being due to humans. I have no idea where she got this from; she did not source this statistic, so I cannot explain why the methodology of the statistic was wrong. Moreover, some of her other sources contradict this argument and statistic, so there is no reason to accept it. CyclesThis round rests on whether or not global warming has an impact. As my observation noted, as long as my opponent believes that there is any type of climate change, global warming necessarily has to exist. This means that even if my opponent has convinced you that global warming is entirely a natural process, she does not win this debate. She needs to demonstrate that the impacts of that process are meaningless, so any discussion of whether or not it is artificial is tangential to the real debate. This observation has been dropped since Round 3. My opponent has maintained throughout this round that any climate change is a result of a cycle.This means that she concedes that global warming does exist in some form. I also agree that cycles exist. I provided evidence in Round 1 that demonstrate that there are cycles every 100,000 years in which carbon levels peak at 285 ppm. According to my evidence, we reached this peak in 1850. That means, according to the cycles, we should not only have reduced carbon levels at the moment, but that we should also be witnessing a reduction in temperature and a reduction in carbon levels. The evidence that I cited notes that our carbon levels are currently increasing at an exponentially high rate and are going against the trends established by the cycle. My opponent then proceeded to not only reject my evidence based on time period, but to also concede that her own evidence did not examine the Earth’s history properly. She completely dropped the argument that I made, however, about how since the cycles last 100,000 years, my evidence, which extends back 600,000 years, is enough to see the trends. Moreover, if she is rejecting her own evidence, she has no basis for for making the claim that global climate change is natural because she has nothing to back up her arguments. She already conceded that her evidence is false, and she did not provide any more evidence to support her assertions. This itself is a reason to accept my evidence because she has not provided any sort of alternative studies that she considers to be more accurate. Ergo, she cannot make her unsupported assertions.While discussing another argument, opponent did provide us with evidence that examines that past 500 million years. Happily, that evidence supports my position. It explicitly notes, “Raising atmospheric CO2 level at a rate of 2ppm/year, a pace unprecedented in the geological record, with the exception of the effects of CO2 released from craters excavated by large asteroid impacts, the deleterious effects of pollution and deforestation have reached a geological dimension, tracking towards conditions which existed on Earth in the mid-Pliocene, about 2.8 million years ago.' Her own evidence is literally telling you that the only time that we have had such rapid increases in CO2 levels was when massive asteroids collided with Earth. Ergo, by her own evidence, which examines the past 500 million years, these levels are only reached artificially, and are not a natural part of the cycle. This was entirely dropped by my opponent. That should be enough to tell you that the global warming we are experiencing is an artificial phenomenon. ImpactsI discussed three impacts of global warming that demonstrate that it is, in fact, an issue. The first impact was that there will be a 30% decrease in the flora and fauna species of this planet. Her only response to this was natural selection allows for the best adapted species to survive. She still has not responded to the rights analysis that I posted in Round 1. Even if the beings who are most fit to survive will survive, that does not mean that we are justified in committing acts that will cause the destruction of 30% of Earth’s species because they have a right to survive. Natural adaptation and competition is one thing, but specifically causing harms to those species is another. It’s the difference between chopping someone’s leg off and seeing someone being born with a birth defect. One is natural and is not our fault. The other is something that we are doing actively and is a violation of rights. The second impact was the increase in natural disasters due to an increase in heat waves. She continuously asserts that global warming does not cause natural disasters. First, I would like to point out that in Round 4, she conceded that the evidence she provided that said there was no link was faulty. Therefore, she is just asserting that there is no link. Second, her own evidence from Round 4 explicitly notes that there will be an increase in natural disasters. I will post the quote again because she dropped it: 'The consequences of open ended rise in atmospheric CO2 are manifest in the geological record (Frontispiece). The world is in a lag period, when increasing atmospheric energy is expressed by intense hurricanes, increased pressure at mid-latitude high pressure zones and shift of climate zones towards the poles. With ensuing desertification of temperate zones, i.e. southern Europe, southern Australia, southern Africa, the desiccated forests become prey to firestorms, such as in Victoria and California.' Her own evidence that SHE chose to cite says that there will be an increase in firestorms and hurricanes. Therefore, global warming increases natural disasters and thus deaths. The final impact was flooding in coastal cities and the deaths of millions of humans and damages in billions of dollars. After Round 3, she did not even attempt to address this point at all. This point is thus conceded and is a cause for concern. By itself, it notes that global warming is an issue because it can cause millions of deaths by flooding coastal cities that are currently above water and also causing billions of dollars in damages to those cities. Voting IssuesPlease vote pro on the following points: 1. Global warming is man-made. She provided no evidence to support her assertions of a wholly natural cycle after she conceded that her evidence should not have been used. 2. Global warming has disastrous effects. Her own sources tell you that there are a rise in natural disasters and she dropped the analysis about the flooding of coastal cities, plethora of human deaths, and and damages in billions of dollars.</t>

<t>Global warming caused by humans?  In round three of this debate I stated that 'Human additions to total greenhouse gases play a small role, contributing about 0.2% - 0.3% to Earth's greenhouse effect.' The definition of global warming is 'what happens when the temperature of the earth increases. This temperature increase is something that happens naturally, although it is also contributed to by human activity.' So as I've stated in the past. I do believe that human involvement is occurring during this stage of the earth's global climate change, but I think it is a very small amount, and for the most part is a natural process.  Dropping Evidence:  The reason I dropped the scientific evidence from the previous rounds is because the earth has been in the universe for 4.6 billion years. So although both of the previous charts may be true, they do not go back far enough to state if global warming is an issue or not. There will always be natural climate cycles. Nothing can stop that from occurring.  Natural Selection:  I do not justify murder by believing in the theory of natural selection. Natural Selection is the survival of the fittest. By survival of the fittest I mean a natural process resulting in the evolution of organisms best adapted to the environment. Humans might even be able to adapt to the climate changes and live through this climate change. It has been going on for so long and we and many other species are still alive. So, to reiterate, I do not justify murder, I just believe that the most well adapted species will survive.  My source from the previous round:  Humans are only altering the earth slightly, as I've said in previous rounds. Also, most species do alter the earth in either a good way or a bad way. At the time that humans first started to increase their carbon dioxide use, they didn't plan on slightly causing the earth's temperatures to rise.  As I have stated in round 3 of this debate, as of now, there is no proof that global warming causes natural disasters. The word natural means that it exists by nature; not made or caused by humankind. And in this argument, you believe that global warming is man-made. So to state that natural disasters are caused by humans must be false because of the definition of the word NATURAL.  Ice Ages:  I do recognize that Ice Ages are caused by low amounts of CO2. The reason that I had mentioned Ice Ages was to show that the earth has high and low amounts. Another reason I mentioned this was to prove that climate changes are natural and that they occur no matter what and there is nothing that humans can do to stop this from occurring.  Carbon Emission:  In my past arguments I have been able to show that carbon levels rise and fall and I have shown many sources that prove that. The reason they are rising is because cycles always occur and the earth is just taking its natural course, like I have said multiple times!  Impacts:  As I have stated earlier, as the earth changes, species die off. It has happened many times in the past and will happen many times in the future. The species that do become extinct were just not the most fit and could not live through different climate changes.  Conclusion:  I still do not believe that global warming is an issue. Earth will continue to change naturally and there is nothing that humans can do to change this from happening. This type of climate change has been going on for a long period of time. Earth is just trying to balance out all the changes that are occurring in the only way it knows how to.</t>

<t>Global warming has been a growing problem over the decade, and with our destruction of forests, use of factories and pollution has undoubtedly contributed to it. As my opponent has stated, it will be his burden to prove that there are other priorities other than the environment, and my burden will be to prove that environment should be the priority over these other issues. I would like to define the following: World environment issues: the current hole we have in the ozone layer, amount of carbon dioxide we are releasing, pollution we are causing, cutting down trees, harming the land by mining... and so forth. Also, this not only contains the actions that are ruining the Earth, but also the ones that happen accidentally, such as oil spills. Priority: issue that is considered first over others Contention 1, Even the current actions aren't doing much to save the environment The Kyoto Protocol, foundations of renewable resources, and many actions have been taken to slow down the Global Warming. However, what good has it done? Sure it reduced the amount of Carbon dioxide we produce, but it still has been rising over the years continuously. See in the example of China. (I couldn't copy the chart on here so you'll have to go on the site to look at it) [1] In 2009, the total amount of carbon dioxide emission was 31,629,955 and in 2010, it was 33,508,901. [2] Contention 2, The world is not safe with these issues unsolved Sub point A. oil spills From the spill in the Gulf of Mexico, we briefly know how dangerous a spill can be. I will show you how exactly it will be harmful to us. Firstly, the fish and the birds die. Birds die from oil spills if their feathers are covered in oil. The bird will then be poisoned because it will try to clean itself. Animals may die because they get hypothermia, causing their body temperature to be really low. They may die from really low body temperature. Oil may also cause the death of an animal by entering the animal's lungs or liver. The animal will then be poisoned by the oil. Oil also can kill an animal by blinding it. The animal will not be able to see and be aware of their predators. If they are not aware of other animals, they may be eaten.[3] Secondly, humans are affected. The cleanup workers exposed to crude oil often suffer acute effects — stinging eyes, rashes, nausea, dizziness, headaches, coughs and other respiratory symptoms. Exposure to oil did induce DNA damage that was greater in those with more exposure. DNA damage can be the first step along the path to cancer.[4] Lastly, even if the companies manage to clean all of the oil, they can't do it perfectly, and some of the traces will still be left in the ocean. This will continue to kill the sea life and marine birds, and suppose that people ate that fish. The people will be poisoned and even if people don't eat this fish, there will be less fish for the fishers to catch. Spills may take weeks, months or even years to clean up.[5] So if an issue like this come up, the government will have to make this a priority because it can take a long time to clean up, and if it is left alone, then it will harm animals and people. Sub point B. decimation of forests. Decimation of forests will soon lead to too much trees being cut down, and we won't have enough trees to use, and the air to be filtered. Air is the necessity of life, but if we cut down too much trees, someday in the future, we won't have enough air for the entire population of the world.  Deforestation affects the amount of water in the soil and groundwater and the moisture in the atmosphere. Forests support considerable biodiversity, providing valuable habitat for wildlife; moreover, forests foster medicinal conservation and the recharge of aquifers.  With forest biotopes being a major, irreplaceable source of new drugs (like taxol), deforestation can destroy genetic variations (such as crop resistance) irretrievably.  Shrinking forest cover lessens the landscape's capacity to intercept, retain and transport precipitation. Instead of trapping precipitation, which then percolates to groundwater systems, deforested areas become sources of surface water runoff, which moves much faster than subsurface flows. That quicker transport of surface water can translate into flash flooding and more localized floods than would occur with the forest cover.  Deforestation also contributes to decreased evapotranspiration, which lessens atmospheric moisture which in some cases affects precipitation levels downwind from the deforested area, as water is not recycled to downwind forests, but is lost in runoff and returns directly to the oceans.  According to one preliminary study, in deforested north and northwest China, the average annual precipitation decreased by one third between the 1950s and the 1980s.  Long-term gains can be obtained by managing forest lands sustainable to maintain both forest cover and provide a biodegradable renewable resource.  Forests are also important stores of organic carbon, and forests can extract carbon dioxide and pollutants from the air, thus contributing to biosphere stability and probably relevant to the greenhouse effect. Forests are also valued for their aesthetic beauty and as a cultural resource and tourist attraction.  Sub point C. the overall unstable environment of the world The upper safety limit for atmospheric CO2 is 350 parts per million (ppm). Atmospheric CO2 levels have stayed higher than 350 ppm since early 1988. [6] According to this, our world is not safe enough for us to rely on the atmosphere. Eventually, something really bad will happen because we just keep continuously emitting carbon dioxide, we'll reach a point where the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is too high. Sub point D. the results of all these issues Scientists warned that as the hole closes up in the next few decades, temperatures on the continent could rise by around 3C on average, with melting ice contributing to a global sea-level increases of up to 1.4m.[7] This is only if the hole in the ozone layer stayed that way. But with the rate we are polluting the Earth, it is not going to stay that big, but it is going to get bigger. If we then try to wait for it to fix itself, the warming of Antarctica is going to continue, and in the end, we'll have oceans so high, that most coastal cities will be underwater. A new Ice Age could come from all this. If enough cold, fresh water coming from the melting polar ice caps and the melting glaciers of Greenland flows into the northern Atlantic, it will shut down the Gulf Stream, which keeps Europe and northeastern North America warm. The worst-case scenario would be a full-blown return of the last ice age - in a period as short as 2 to 3 years from its onset - and the mid-case scenario would be a period like the 'little ice age' of a few centuries ago that disrupted worldwide weather patterns leading to extremely harsh winters, droughts, worldwide desertification, crop failures, and wars around the world.</t>

<t>The pro is arguing that the most important issue currently facing the world is related to its environment. I will be giving several examples of important world issues. If I can prove that at least one of these examples is more important than the world environment I have fulfilled my burden of proof, and therefore I should win.  We are humans, therefore the survival of humans and the minimization of human suffering should be our highest priority. The importance of an issue in this debate should be determined by the potential consequences of ignoring the issue. If the consequences of issue X are more severe than issue Y, then issue X becomes the top priority by default. My CaseIssue 1: Maintaining and Improving International Relations. Planet Earth has come a long way in the past couple thousand years. The most notable advancement humans have made is in technology. As of now, Syria, North Korea, and Iran are all in possession of nuclear weapons[1]. Three very unstable nations possessing nuclear weapons which are obviously capable of immense destructive power. If a Nuclear War was ever to occur, the loss of human life would be absolutely devastating. It is estimated that after a nuclear war, more than half of the world’s population would be wiped out[2]. Nuclear war has the greatest potential for severe consequences, therefore avoidance should be our highest priority. Issue 2: The Water Crisis. Currently, 3.5 million people die each year from water-related disease. 84% of the people who die are children between the ages of 0-14[3]. Obviously this is a significant loss of human life. Especially over such a trivial matter such as the availability of water and the sanitation of said water. This is a higher priority over the global environment because this crisis is occurring right this second. The pro’s issue of the global environment is not causing such a significant amount of death as with this crisis. Issue 3: Global OverpopulationDue to advancements in modern medicine, decreased mortality rates, and increased fertility rates; the human population is growing exponentially. This exponential growth will eventually lead to earth reaching its carrying capacity for human beings. What this means is that we will one day reach a point where the Earth will not longer be able to sustain the human population with its resources. This will result in mass starvation and chaos. The average scientific estimate for Earth’s carrying capacity is between 10-15 billion people[4]. Human beings will likely reach 9 billion people by 2050[5]. This is a serious and imminent danger. It may not directly affect us within our lifetime but we have an obligation to prevent human overpopulation because of the amount of suffering and death it would inevitably cause if left to continue.Pro Case Contention 1: Even the current actions aren't doing much to save the environmentI’m not going to dispute the fact that CO2 emissions have been rising, but what are the potential consequences of this? What makes this important enough that it should be the highest priority? The pro needs to make an argument instead of just listing facts.Contention 2: The world is not safe with these issues unsolvedSub point A. oil spillsThe first half of this sub-point touches on the deaths that will be caused to animals. The priority here is human life so unless this disaster could drastically affect human life then it should definitely not be the highest priority. As for the human suffering associated with cleaning up the oil spills, I have to ask how? Do they not wear protective gear when cleaning up a biohazard? Regardless, pro has only stated that it would essentially just cause pain/irritation and MAYBE in some cases cause cancer. The issues I will address in my case supercede this point because the potential consequences are much more deadly to the human populace. Sub point B. decimation of forests.'Decimation of forests will soon lead to too much trees being cut down, and we won't have enough trees to use, and the air to be filtered. Air is the necessity of life, but if we cut down too much trees, someday in the future, we won't have enough air for the entire population of the world.'I would really like to see a source to verify your claim that someday we won’t have enough air. Until I see evidence this is just a bare assertion and can be dismissed as such. As for the rest of the contention, flash flooding is a very minor issue compared to the ones I have addressed in my own case. Once again, I must ask, what are the potential consequences of ignoring the issue? Pro once again merely has a lengthy list of scientific information and no argumentation. What makes this issue so important that it must be the highest priority? Sub point C. the overall unstable environment of the world'The upper safety limit for atmospheric CO2 is 350 parts per million (ppm). Atmospheric CO2 levels have stayed higher than 350 ppm since early 1988. [6] According to this, our world is not safe enough for us to rely on the atmosphere. Eventually, something really bad will happen because we just keep continuously emitting carbon dioxide, we'll reach a point where the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is too high.'Eventually, something really bad will happen...Like what? What will happen when we reach this point where the CO2 is too high? Sub point D. the results of all these issuesPro never really addresses the results of ALL the issues listed above. They merely discuss the coming of a second ice age. I’m assuming this is related to the high CO2 emissions mentioned early, but I am not certain. While I must admit that the global environment is an important issue, it is not the most important. It is simply not the highest on our list of priorities.  So with that, I eagerly await my opponent's response!</t>

<t>Yay, I managed to get this short enough at last!I thank con for getting this going. In doing this debate, I follow in the great tradition of New Zealand's former prime minister David Lange.

Lange became the first person in decades to recieve a standing ovation from both sides of the house [1]. Today I am arguing against nuclear energy. Not just big civilian nuclear power plants. Not just nuclear weapons. Not just nuclear clocks or submarines. I argue that the use of nuclear power in all its forms is morally indefensible.After Lange's awesome speech, New Zealand abolished nuclear weapons. Despite claims by the US that we'd need nuclear power plants, nuclear submarines patrolling our shores, and so on and so forth, we have remained nuclear free to this day [2]. And guess what? We're not facing an energy crisis. Our national defense is far less at risk than that of every single nuclear country. And our people have never regretted the decision.Recently, Germany, a major nuclear nation, said they will move toward doing the same as New Zealand by 2022. So far progress has been good, indicating that it is not beyond the realm of possibility for other large nations to follow our lead.Today, I argue that such a model would be beneficial to the whole world, for one simple moral reason. Every nuclear device, when it generates energy, generates waste that we cannot safely dispose of. Take, for instance, the United States in America. The very latest in nuclear technology. The wisest of scientists and engineers. And yet even they dispose of most of their waste by throwing it to the bottom of swimming pools. Incredulously, some people at the NAS actually bothered to examine whether this was dangerous or not, and their results were exactly as you would expect [3]. Some waste is thrown to the bottom of 'sealed' tunnels, and my opponent's source suggests this is ideal (though they agree it is not what's currently happening due to 'political will'). But consider this - the EPA was recently told, in America, that many of their nuclear deposits could last a million years [4]. No seal can survive that long. Even pure diamond, several meters thick would crack and break, just as all the diamonds from the past million years have cracked and broken. The ground may be stable now, but as it has been unstable in the past million years, so too will it be unstable again.The problem with the waste is that it's radioactive. According to almost every expert, there is no safe level of radioactivity [5]. A Geiger counter only measures how quickly you are approaching your death. We know that miners and plant workers who recieved only mild doses of radiation have died of various cancers [6]. People die from nuclear energy, even when done correctly (mind you, human error doesn't help).Construction costs are rising, construction is taking longer, operational costs are rising [8], and while there are promising next-generation reactors (some of which my opponent mentioned) they should not be legalised for construction until they have been properly scientifically tested. All this is to fund the creation of over 12.3 million kilograms of toxic waste every year, from the United States alone [7]. No renewable energy source has a by-product that dangerous or large. This is immoral, because of the heavy cost in human lives. Just as nuclear weapons are bad because of the immediate cost in human lives, so nuclear power is bad because of the long-term cost in human lives. Never forget that just one month before Chernobyl, the Economist said nuclear power was 'as safe as a chocolate factory.'The danger of nuclear weapons is already well-known. A nuclear power station is nothing more than an extremely slow nuclear weapon, not designed to unleash its power in one explosion, but designed slowly to poison.And now on to con's case.Con gives four reasons why recklessly and dangerously polluting the world is OK. I'll deal with them in reverse order. Jobs, his fourth point, is moot because any jobs lost from not having nuclear might equally be gained from having another power source. So instead of people checking on the safety of nuclear reactors, perhaps they can employ engineers to monitor tidal energy constructions.Thirdly con says we get cheap electricity. The US Department of Energy researched this in their 'Levelized Cost of New Generation Resources in the Annual Energy Outlook 2011'. They found that an advanced nuclear power plant could produce electricity at $109-$124 per megawatt hour. That's cheap - but wind energy was only $81-$115. Geothermal was only $91-$115. Hyrdoelectric was $58-$121. Biomass, still in its infancy, was already just $99-$133. So clearly nuclear is far from the cheapest option! Con's sources are largely from the lobby group 'World Nuclear Association' - in their words, they are 'promoters' and 'supporters' of nuclear energy [9] so not exactly an unbiased group! Their membership is comprised of companies who all have a financial stake in nuclear power [10]. Just because my opponent sources some assertions by this unscientific lobby group doesn't mean their claims hold water. His only other relevant source states 'I’m quite frankly more interested in cheaper solar and fuel cell options, which is where I think the primary future of energy generation is headed (with some supplementation from wind and geothermal)' (emphasis added).Secondly con says nuclear power is safe. I agree completely that nuclear is just as safe as other energy. The only problem is that when a solar panel breaks down, a couple of people moan because the electricity goes out. When a nuclear plant breaks down, the whole planet jumps up and starts screaming. As I've already sourced, nuclear plants are on a trend of becoming more expensive, countering that part of the argument. And his Wikipedia source about workers being competant states there is a serious accident once every 8 years or so. When dealing with things so contaminative, so dangerous, this is completely unacceptable. And con thinks he can hold these things for a million years after they're in the plant without anything ever going wrong! And we can keep making advancements with my exemption for scientific research. Until we know how to properly contain the waste, we should not deal with it.Firstly, con says nuclear energy is cleaner. There is a danger, I think, of environmentalism being confused with climate change. Climate change is one problem - we face MANY more, including a radiation-filled environment which causes cancers and death. So while nuclear emits less CO2 than solar (if you foolishly exclude construction emmissions and refinement emmissions), the point is that they have a wildly different effect on the environment anyway. I believe renewability may be a problem (uranium is a finite resource) but even if nuclear power was totally sustainable, the sustained destruction of our planet and people would be still worse than temporary destruction. And that thing he says about waste being safe and containable... oh look, that's another unsupported assertion from our new favorite lobby group, the World Nuclear Association. Nuclear power is not green.All of con's arguments just don't hold water.Recently the world has been angry at Iran for developing nuclear technology. I think they're right, but the rest of the world shouldn't be so hypocritic about it! Nuclear power is dangerous. I'll continue my case in a moment, once con has had a chance to respond.</t>

<t>I thank my opponent for a fun debate. To voters, don't think that just because con cited a million lobby groups he has any credibility. He has misquoted and twisted sources, as I have shown, quoted personal opinions of lobby group members as facts, and ignored almost all of my sources. But on to what actually matters in the debate - the arguments:WasteFirst, on solar energy. I've already said solar panels can be safely recycled. My opponent's source is an article detailing how solar companies are setting up recycling programmes. Con also drops pretty much all of my counter-arguments from last round, such as how their quantity is much smaller than nuclear and how we aren't 'throwing out' anything, only REMOVING these dangerous chemicals from the environment and putting them into solar cells.Second, on wind energy. Hey look, it's a new argument in round four! My opponent claims wind is a waste of money. Well, that's much better from a moral perspective than a waste of human lives, which is what nuclear does! My opponent's main source that wind is a waste of money is a letter to the editor of a newspaper expressing an extremist opinion (and the author is the executive director of an organisation sponsored by nuclear lobbyists called 'Great Lakes Wind Truth'). I've already provided evidence that wind is not any more costly than nuclear, and in fact the US government says it's cheaper. The wind lobbyists claim their turbines cost only five cents per kwh (cheaper than coal by a mile!) [1], and I think they'd know better than the nuclear lobbyists. 500 homes is quite a bit considering that most wind farms have hundreds, if not thousands of turbines.Third, my opponent notes radiation occurs with geothermal energy. Wow, more new arguments. That's because geothermal requires an energy input - usually it requires about 1kw for a geothermal plant to generate 5kw. In the USA (con's source is from the US government), this initial current is usually generated with a nuclear reactor. I say - why not do what NZ does, and use hydroelectric or wind to generate that initial 1kw? No radiation is generated as part of the geothermal generation process, and NO byproducts are generated unless it's broken (waste fluid is re-injected back into the Earth).Fourth, hydroelectric. As with wind energy, don't believe con's assertions that it's more expensive. It isn't. Fish population displacement is a problem, so any potential site would need to be evaluated for this purpose to check that fish can still breed etc. Many newer hydroelectric dams have elaborate systems to allow fish to be elevated up and down the dam, circumventing this problem.Next my opponent sources three more lobby-group assertions (seriously, stop quoting World Nuclear!) to boost his sources count. All three assertions I have already countered.It's not just that waste is the main issue. It's the danger that the waste poses to human lives. Con has never specifically addressed this fact. No other industry has so much waste - indeed, no green energy has ANY toxic byproducts from electricity generation. I never said I wanted to ban coal, I said I'm against coal power plants, so my opponent's coal assertions are irrelevant.I didn't drop any of the argument concerning safe waste disposal because it didn't exist. My opponent made no case in round three that it was safe except for a breif assertion that I answered with reference to a scientific study that I had already cited. Regulations do not make waste safe. No regulation can stop a major environmental disaster breaking them open, or the radiation that we KNOW is leaking out. More importantly, no regulation IS doing it. Also I did talk about Lead at the same time as I talked about Mercury - ever used a lead-acid battery, con?And about the economists who don't like solar cells, the Chinese point out that to make the solar panels they use American equipment, and sell them to America so that America can make money off them. It's really a win-win for both countries. Also my opponent confused exports and imports last round. I guess some economists really are stupid... [2]WeaponsMy weapons analogy was not to show that a nuclear power plant behaves like a nuclear weapon. My point was to show that they are the same except one is operating in a controlled fashion. That's not conceeding the debate, or even the argument. Con has never even addressed the point. I'm not referring to a dirty bomb or any explosive device at all. I'm just saying that the same dangerous effects felt by places around a nuclear bomb in ten seconds are felt in places around a nuclear power plant in 1000 years or so.JobsI said in round one that I would not instantly fire all nuclear workers. There are many jobs in decommissioning plants (usually even more than are required for their running), plus there would be jobs in all the other things that would need decommissioning. That would give time for capital investment to flow into the clean energy sector and create the jobs. Nuclear power has created more jobs because they've had more investment - and despite this, wind and solar have had far more new capacity additions [3]. I've already proven that solar is better in terms of job creation (see last round). It's not just that I'm scared. It's that there are tangible harms to me being right, and tangible benefits to following my model even if I'm wrong. More jobs is a tangible benefit of following my model.CostAgain, my opponent shows his ineptitude at reading sources. It doesn't say 67 cents, it says 67 dollars. And it included nuclear power plant tax breaks and subsidies. The study I cited did not include any government market manipulation and was therefore a much better way to evaluate relative costs. It also used a much larger number of data points, using the whole of the USA instead of just California.SafetyI've already provided a source proving that there is NO HARMLESS LEVEL OF RADIATION. Every tiny bit of radiation has some impact. X-rays last a few seconds at most - these people had to live with all that radiation for years! And his only source saying the contrary comes from World Nuclear's spin doctors, not the medical doctors whom I cited. On my opponent's round 2 case, I dealt with that in round 2, and my opponent did not respond - he dropped it, not me.GreenLess pollutants is needed - so why is con supporting a power generation system that creates 12.3 million kilograms of pollutants for his country alone? Preventing climate change is a start, but not polluting other aspects of the environment is part of environmentalism too. Just ask Lucy Lawless and her Arctic buddies. My opponent continuously reasserts that nuclear is safe, but he does so only by citing lobby group articles, when I have cited scientific research showing the opposite. He has given no responses to any of these. I have shown other alternatives (green energy), and that it is not the presence of alternatives that constitutes a ban, but the danger of the waste produced by nuclear. About the CO2 graph, I talked about CO2 in rounds 2 and 3 already, my opponent is still trying to get me to repeat myself.Finally, con claims my arguments are circular. Obviously he does not know what a circular argument is. None of my premises have made it into my conclusions. Anybody who has the vaguest understanding of formal logic will be able to see that. And then to claim that I haven't attempted to counter his refutations shows that he clearly hasn't even read any of my round 2 case and is just making stuff up.It's time that the world woke up to the dangers of nuclear energy. We cannot support a system that creates so much un-necessary waste when there are so many better alternatives available. That's why I'm proud to affirm the motion.Vote pro!Sources1 - goo.gl/0dm6a2 - goo.gl/Ami4W3 - goo.gl/YqHlE</t>

<t>~ WASTE ~Waste for SOLAR:Solar panels contain some of the most toxic metals in the business of electricity generation. [1] These modules last about 20 years so when you throw them out you are throwing out potentially toxic waste into the environment. [1]Waste from WIND: Other then the mining involved, the wastes for wind are another story: Money. [2] further more wind power can only power 500 homes per turbine on average. [3] So it is efficient and costly. Nuclear is one of the most efficient power sources. [4]Wastes from GEOTHERMAL:Actually geothermal has some radioactive waste products and emits many poisons gases into the air. [5]Wastes from HYDROELECTRIC: There is a lot of investment needed in hydroelectric costs and evaporate the water and displace local fish populations, and kill others. [6] So, all of his nothing statements are FALSE.'Nuclear wastes are neither particularly hazardous nor hard to manage relative to other toxic industrial wastes.' [7]'The amount of radioactive wastes is very small relative to wastes produced by fossil fuel electricity generation. ' [7]'Nuclear power is the only large-scale energy-producing technology which takes full responsibility for all its wastes and fully costs this into the product. ' [7]Really if waste is the main issue, then most electric industries should be banned, solar, and fossil fuels. If this is a major reason then we might as well say bye to all energy types. Now my opponent wants to ban coal?!?! Coal is a needed ingredient for steel making. [8] Still: If waste is an issue all fossil fuels and solar energies should be banned too. Your reasoning is very circular. Then my opponent talks about mercury. Actually it has lead and other metals that are linked to kidney and lung damage. [9] Solar panels are the FUTURE of toxic waste. Once again if waste is a problem then almost all energy types should be banned. This argument is all fallacious and has very circular reasoning. He drops all of my argument regarding SAFE waste disposal, regulations making it safe, and NRC and EPA checks making it safe. Actually the imports from china Solar cells hurt the US solar company's. [10] I found a whole bunch of economists on my side. Challenge accepted. ~Weapons! YAY! wait...~SPLITTING THE ATOM!!!!! MY opponent basically conceded here. Nuclear plants create nuclear fission which is where we let the atoms decay releasing photons and neutrons. [11] In that case, nuclear power has nothing to do with nuclear weapons, therefore you have basically unknowingly conceded. What you are referring to is known as a dirty bomb. [12] It is pop a grenade off goes the nuclear plant! The only way you can do this is if a crazy gets into the plant, there are many regulations, laws, and training that prevent this. [12] Also you then claim the plant can go boom like bomb, false. There are many barriers inside and outside of plants preventing these radiation leaks. [13]Also:Q. Can a nuclear plant explode like a nuclear weapon?A. ' Absolutely not. A nuclear explosion is impossible in a commercial nuclear power plant. A power plant doesnâ€™t contain the type of fuel in the amount which is needed to make atomic bombs.' [13]Your argument about weaponize is utterly false. Drops my enrichment argument.~jobs!~I seriously think your reasoning is well, a fallacy. Banning the power would mean thousands of people out of a job, and you try to claim it is ok. How? If they are fired they will not instantly get a job again! This reasoning is utterly false. Nuclear power has created new 15,000 jobs in only a few years, and solar only 7000. [14, 15] Nuclear power increases state economic worth and creates more revenues. [14] Even if other energies are better (name one in job creation), Nuclear still deserves to stay, and in my opinion your arguments are all just 'I'm scared, so is Greenpeace, lets ban it' which is kind of a poor argument. ~cost~Um... OK he wants megawatts XD Nuclear in the US costs 67 cents per MWH. [16] On the table its the cheapest one except its tied with geothermal and barely over wind. Need I say more? (dang sources take up all the room... have to be brief). ~Safety~ Lol time for 3 miller! The amount of radiation exposure to people was so small it was harmless. [17] It gave less radiation exposure then an X-ray. [17] 'There were no injuries or adverse health effects from the Three Mile Island accident. ' [18] No accidents, little exposure, it must have been contained to only have this minor effects. He drops the majority of my round 2 case on the subject. ~Green~Emitting less pollutants is needed for a green energy! Preventing climate change is needed for being green. As I stated above Nuclear is actually very efficient (see above). My opponent claims I ignore the radiation. No I have not. I have stated many times how the workers keep it contained, have blocks preventing radiation leaks, and have proven many times that nuclear is safe. Also, you have cited no other single alternatives! Also, alternatives constitute a ban? If so then that is absurd! Macs in many peoples eyes are alternatives to PC's, wanna ban PC's? No. Wanna ban Macs because PC's may be alternatives? NO. The point is having alternatives doesn't constitute a ban, and I have proven the arguments of 'crap radiation!' are false, and well fallacies. All of the arguments presented are circular as you have provided no reasons they are not green except for waste, I refuted this with great facts and you totally act like its not there and claim it is still dangerous. I have refuted all of this, and you have not countered my refutations. I am forced to extend much of my argument from round 3. Here's a pretty graph about polluting! </t>

<t>You're not winning that easily! Sorry I missed the last round, but I'm still going to fight to win this debate.' but may I ask why do we need them?'So you're asking why we need to protect cities against tidal waves? Okay.. tidal waves damage houses, buildings, vegetation and roads. Look at this image: As you can see, there was a lot of destruction caused, which could have been reduced by sea walls.' 'we' need them because some people want to invest in a expensive house that will ineffably be destroyed by the waves. Like I said some people are lacking common sense when the build/buy along the beach/beaches cliff.'Some clarification would be great. I don't see how people who buy houses on the coast are lacking common sense, as with the installation of sea walls they won't be washed away. ' people want to invest in a expensive house that will ineffably be destroyed by the waves.'Seems like you're arguing my side of the debate here... 'we use roads every day, they are a MUCH NEEDED commute system, houses, they are more NEEDED than sea walls' It seems like you haven't understood my point. What I was saying was that even though sea walls are expensive, it is worth it because the cost of repairing roads should a tidal wave occur, is higher. It's like, if someone was going to steal your $1000 car and an alarm system cost $90, it would be illogical to say that getting the alarm system was too costly. I agree that roads are very much needed, which is why we should treasure them and protect them with sea walls.In no way did I state or believe that sea walls should priorotise above roads though. 'once again a sea wall in NOT going to protect against a tsunami!'Agreed.... care to quote a part of my argument that says that the will? I just stated that they would reduce the impact, not stop them completely. ' but, do you really think that sea walls are going protect us from tsunamis?'No I don't.  Check  my response to your previous quote ^.'No they truly don't 'reduce' anything except the budget of the home owners and govt.'.... Reduce the budget of homeowners? How so? Also, like I sad: there is an increasingly huge chance that a tidal wave will occur due to climate change, and if anything will reduce the government's budget it's going to be repairing all that damage! Sea walls are relatively cheap, compared to repairing houses, roads and conpensating families.Also, you didn't really rebut my point about beach traffic, so I guess I've won that clash point!I look forward to your response.</t>

<t>I believe that colonization of the moon would be useless to humanity and major waste of resources. The moon has nothing to offer but space and we could have no gain of resources, not only that but we would have to give everything from water food and air to it the entire idea would be a waste of time and resources.</t>

<t>1. I still find moon colonization as over doing it for a single resource unless this thing will shoot so far into the technological future that it will cure aids cancer and make us immortal than not really worth it.  2. I also fail to see the evidence of India as a threat sure they have the weapons but they have no motive to use them and no one on the earth wants to pick a nuke fight with the winners of the cold war. As for China whoopdy dooo they have a smart computer I'll be concerned when it picks up a weapon and starts commanding armies until then its no concern.  3. My point stands that the moon's colonization would be more costly than profitable not just in resources but in human lives no matter what frontier it is people die wether it is Egypt taking the Sahara Rome in Germania and England the Pilgrims coming to America the Pioneers moving west many lives were lost in all of them and this is a new frontier its not building a new city in a far away land its not sailing across the ocean to a new place its leaving our planet for the first time to an unstable are lives will be lost many of them and Humanity dose not have the can do spirit as much anymore we took Earth we colonized every last bit of it with our blood sweet and tears and since Humanity put that flag in that one little piece of unclaimed land our want to explore and to die for knowledge. I don't think the moon a rock flouting around in space is worth the hundreds maybe even thousands of human lives lost in the process of taking it.</t>

<t>1. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the moon was once part of Earth. Earth has resources, so the moon should have some aswell. 2. Supercomputer, being faster is everything. If you are faster you have a beter econ and military. Pro drops India arguement and doesn't refute the U.S. is low on Hegemoty. 3. Terriform the moon. 4. Pro states there is no evidense of GW, but if he was on www.futuretimeline.com, he would see the equations and there are even worse things that will happen if you continue to read into the future. 5.

<t>By experimentation, we can tell that carbon dioxide,carbon monoxide and other greenhouse gases has a higher specific heat capacity than air itself. If we are chucking out tons of  those gases a day into the atmosphere I think we can safely say that Global Warming is almost certainly caused by us. It's not been over exaggerated. If you look at the global mean annual rise in temperature, its not really much. But its rising and that's a big problem that we need to solve early before it gets too late. We aren't playing about in a localized national context. This is something that's on a Global scale. We can very well make Earth inhospitable to us and we would have nowhere else to go. And the global warming theory has been discovered way before any of your eco- friendly products came about.</t>
