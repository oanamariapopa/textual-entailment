    <t>A Note: My arguments, which I started constructing before my opponent posted his round, have been based on the assumption that global warming is happening. If my opponent wishes to dispute this, I’ll argue that in Round 3, and it may be my main thrust of that round.I’d like to begin by noting that this debate doesn’t really hinge that much on who, or what, is causing global warming. C1: Public Health Many disease-carrying organisms can live only in areas with specific temperatures. For example, dengue fever is spread by (primarily) the mosquito Aedes aegypti, and lower temperatures limit disease transmission—this is because freezing temperatures kill overwinter larvae and eggs, size is reduced in warmer regions (making them have to feed more frequently to develop their eggs), and shorter incupation period for the virus (dengue type-2 has a period of twelve days at 30 C, but only has a period of seven days at 32-35 C).[1] All of these mean that warming temperatures would cause a significant increase in disease transmission.Dengue fever has no vaccine against it, and can be dangerous to certain groups (for instance, young children).[2] As many people in the South are uninsured[3], and the fever would be expanding its range into the South, we can reasonably conclude that dengue fever would cause significant problems due to global warming. The same can be said of yellow fever[4].Heat waves also pose a danger. Despite the fact that cold snaps might be reduced in frequency, the evidence indicates it won’t make up for increased deaths due to heat waves[5]. In part this is because extreme heat behaves differently than extreme cold, because it is more difficult to adapt to extreme heat.C2: Sea Level Rise: Sea level rise could potentially be very dangerous. Aside from the fact that nations like Tuvalu are at risk of partially submerging[6], there is a general risk of hundreds of millions of people in the developing world being displaced by sea level rise[7]. C3: Oceanic Acidification:As carbon dioxide levels rise, the ocean will absorb carbon dioxide. This in turn will acidify the ocean, which will cause organisms that use calcium carbonate to build their shells to have problems doing so[8]. Sea stars also have severe impacts inflicted on them (a drop of pH of .2 to .4 causes only .1% of a species of temperature brittle star larva to survive), as would squid (including commercially important species)[9]. Aside from the harmful effects on sea life (since we aren’t only talking about humans here), this damages coral reefs, and coral reefs are a useful source of tourist-related revenue[10]. Ergo we can reasonably conclude that ocean acidification will harm the economy of some areas. C4: Cloud Forests: Mountains have climates that vary based on elevation. For instance, the bottom might be forest, and the top might be an icecap. Cloud forests follow this pattern; the temperature depends on elevation. Plant and animal species in cloud forests rely on specific temperatures and humidity levels. In fact, the cloud forests of Costa Rica and the Andes have been rising over time—as the climate warms, the preferable temperature area moves upwards, resulting in the preferable elevation moving upwards. As a result, species have to move upwards—plants, for example, will have to move an average of 2600 feet to remain in equilibrium with climate, and they’ll have to do that by 2100 (based on 2006 statistics). In the Monteverde cloud forest, this may be already happening. Dry seasons are longer (since the mid-1070s) and this has coincided with some local extinctions (a few amphibian species, for instance) </t>

    <t>I'll cover all of the standing arguments in this speech; in order.  1. Terrorism - You recognize yourself that there is an increase in terrorism which can be directly correlated with technological development. The problem with this is that we can't come to an agreement with other countries, above all else, it's empirically proven that technology separates us from other parts of the world. Countries that view things differently from one another (i.e. The United States and the majority of corrupt Middle Eastern countries) won't have any reason to make agreements with us. It's a bit outrageous to think we can actually make some countries come to full agreements with us (as much as you and I both would like to see). The biggest point here is simply... with the increase of technology we see ourselves getting further away from other countries, it's a sad reality. -You're absolutely correct, technology does come with a cost. We both agree with this statement. Unfortunately, the cost is too much to handle, as I'm stressing in all of my arguments in this debate.  2. Social Media -I think that the fact they use it in school was more of an example and you shouldn't disregard the other points I brought up. I don't care to argue whether or not they would read a book if they didn't have a phone (which I think would still be better..) The argument I have here.. the one I want to stress is that it consumes our lives everywhere. Not just in school. Just for further clarification, people will stop communicating at a dinner table. I come from a family where we can't have our phones out at dinner time, I talk about my day and I find interest in mundane things about my family members' days. I go to a good friend's house and they all (parents included) text on their phones. They don't bother to ask about their day. This might be pure speculation, but it's odd that I have people skills and can show emotions better than my friend. I think there's a strong line of correlation that displays people who use technology less are more personable. There will be exceptions of course, I'm sure. I mean, even our writing/spelling/grammar skills are hurt. Shorthand on the things you write and the proper spelling of things. It hurts me to see people in my high school class not know how to spell things I vividly remember learning in... 2nd grade.  3. Social Media/Bullying I actually planned on kicking this argument after my initial post, but your response has actually made me want to continue it. You're absolutely right on everything you say, but there are so many cases (recent) where it doesn't matter. This is just one example, take into consideration there are a lot of other similar stories, but I can recall a few years back I heard about a college student who was *doing his man stuff*, and a group of students must have recorded him somehow, they posted that video of him on multiple sites and he went on to kill himself. No 'Terms of Service' and deactivation of an account can automatically stop you from becoming a meme and living a life of embarrassment. I don't think that this argument is NEARLY as important as my others, but it is a good example of showing how Internet can have negative impacts.  4. Human Extinction I agree that we are doing our best to make sure our carrying capacity is increased. But even if that's true, we're only increasing our maximum capacity at a slow rate, in the mean time we continue to do things like pollute the air and destroy the ozone (with technology, mind you). And I don't mean to be disrespectful to scientists, but come on.. we haven't made any progress in the last 30 years as far as space exploration with man made missions. When it's too late, it will be too late. Where are we honestly going to go? Sure we've talked about the Moon and Mars, but there isn't any underlying evidence that shows we'll be able to support colonies of people on other celestial bodies.  5. Animal Extinction -This has got to irritate me the most, that you really think it's okay for us to put so many groups of animals in endangerment and push it further to extinction. When you say that 'if it wasn't worth it to people, it wouldn't be happening' you sound so ignorant. Aside from being able to witness the beauty of animals in their natural habitat and the beauty of nature, that isn't going to my focus as I near the end of my argument. -The animals and plants we lose, are the important ones.. I'm going to take this from a study from Drew Harvell a professor at Cornell University that basically says, 'the ones that help us fight disease are the ones that are being killed by human carelessness, and the species that do survive are the ones that pass on things like lyme disease and west nile.' -For example, when forests are fragmented, opossum numbers decline and white-footed mice thrive. Opossums serve as buffers for Lyme disease because they absorb and kill some of the ticks that carry the disease; at the same time, mice amplify both the numbers of ticks and the Lyme disease pathogen. Scientists do not know why the most resilient species, such as mice, are the ones that also amplify pathogens.  6. I don't mean to throw a new argument your way at this point, but I do want to point out that climate change can be linked to my 4th and 5th arguments. Climate Change is a real issue that we're not compensating for with our so to speak 'green policies' where we try and help the environment. The fact is, we deteriorate the ozone layer more than we compensate for it with what we try and do.  You're right; that probably is very true explanation and definition of what technology is, we create it so it makes life easier, and to help with our desires. That doesn't mean our desires are good, man is selfish and we are willing to do things like kill animals, and destroy the environment, and be completely reckless with it. A lot of your arguments are kind of around this principle of 'technology isn't bad, people are the ones doing the bad things' but I just want to highlight that your topic of discussion here is technological advancements are good and they can't be good when we see all 6 of the things I've pointed out. Technology obviously can't be bad, since it's an inanimate object... but it's creation is what separates man on many levels.</t>

    <t>Thank you for accepting.  It is true that technology can be used in harmful ways, one of them being increased terrorism. However, the real problem lies in the actions the US and other countries do to 'provoke' terrorist peoples to use technology against us. Although they wouldn't be such a threat without such abilities, the more important thing is to make an agreement with them and make the best out of technology. As they say, there is no free lunch, so the arrival of new weapons is going to come with a cost, but not one that overwhelms the benefits.  The effect of TV, email, and text messages is that youth who participate with these inventions are becoming much more connected and, yes, occupied. While a student may use a phone in school, the issue is the boredom of the scholar and the barely enforced rule of 'no phones allowed' or whatever. If they didn't have this technology, then they would be sneaking a book underneath their desk, and their attention would still be diverted.  The Internet can be a vile place. However, it comes with a 'Terms of Service' that is automatically accepted every time you open a browser. What it states is that - Whatever you participate in, whether it be Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, or others, you are responsible for your words and others can say or do anything they want. If you don't like their comments, it is your utmost responsibility to delete your account, or you are wandering back into flame war territory. If you don't like the Internet, or what people will do there, don't use it. In addition, I am almost sure most people would prefer getting insulted online than getting cornered and pounded by the very same bully.  This is a challenging area to talk about because what people WANT to do is help all others live longer, but they KNOW the population is increasing at an unsafe rate and increased life expectancy is a major cause of this problem. However, technology is not only for healing the sick or prolonging the lives of the old, it can be applied to eliminating the side effects of overpopulation. As the world's population skyrockets, so does space exploration technology. If massive crowds of people at every corner on this planet turns into such a problem, then we know that scientists will get their butts in gear to send people off to another habitable planet. In the end, what you are doing is helping more people live longer without causing too much trouble with the population. With a drawback, technology brings a better bonus.  It is quite sad that animals are dying out and forests are being eliminated as we speak, but if it wasn't worth it to people, it wouldn't be happening. Technology, like a market, fits to whatever people want or need best. If people don't care about a forest, then they will cut it down, even if they know of the harm to the animal species that once lived there.  Overall, technology helps people achieve what they want, so it reflects mankind's desires. This may be the survival of its kind, the ability to communicate more easily, or to clear out land for farming or other uses. Regardless of what it is, it is not the fault of new technology that these bad situations are popping up, it is man's own fault, and his decisions are what need to change.</t>

    <t>I'm new here as well, best of luck.  The Pro's opening argument consists of two basic ideas; that technology is advancing fast and that that it is beneficial to us. Now, I won't deny my usage of technology. I think everyone in industrialized countries in fact takes technology for granted at time. But I can't say I agree that technology advancement is necessarily for the better. In a world that has made so many technological developments in the past century alone, we can see that it's probably been more of a detriment to us than beneficial. I have 5 primary contentions to the Pro. I will label all of the arguments so you can address them easier.  1. Terrorism Harms Increase in weapons such as bombs, guns, and even using vehicles to kill people (whether it's cars or planes). I think this is a common argument and doesn't need much elaboration. In the next century we're bound to blow up the planet. Technology has shown to hurt our collaboration between countries, and terrorism is (sadly) a growing danger to people of the 'superpower' countries on our planet.  2. Social Media Impact Harms We become self-reliant on technology; things like social media have absolutely consumed young peoples' lives. I can't deny that when I don't have Internet for an extended period of time I feel beyond deprived. But after awhile, I realize I don't need it. I think technology hurts face-to-face communicative ability of our youth. I'll admit I like things like Facebook, but I don't let it affect my schooling. When I can seriously see people in an 8-hour day of school use their phone so much I can't believe it. They text, IM, they use social media, they take pictures, they don't focus on the material being taught at that moment in class, they act inappropriately if they get their phones taken away. Technology hurts our youth far too much.  3. Social Media Harms - Extension (thought this little portion needed it's own section) There is further concern when people can go as far as to RUINING someone's life on the Internet. People are much more hurtful in modern times..  4. Human Extinction Harm Population increase is shown to be a big problem, we're expected to surpass our carrying capacity within the next century, and quite frankly we don't have a good solution for that. When technology has helped with the developments of medicine by preventing death and increasing life spans its made for a big problem on Earth. The increase in technology can go as far as put us through extinction! If that doesn't shoot down your belief that technological growth (especially at this rate) is good... I'm not sure what will!  5. Animal Extinction/Habitat Destruction My final argument is going to simply be showing the effects on other life on Earth. Many species have faced extinction because of man, we do things like deforestation that destroys their habitat, polluting oceans. I don't want to extend on this too much to be quite honest.  By reflecting on what has been said by both sides so far; I agree that progress can help out in life.. I don't think technological growth is beneficial to our planet, to other species on this planet, and furthermore.. to us.</t>

    <t>Sorry for the late post.  Well, this is my last round, and I will have no more to say after you post your final argument. It was a pleasure debating with you thus far and you have provided some formidable cases to me. I will invite you to another debate that I am planning to create soon, probably the effects of a free market on a population.  A point I want to make is that while one animal is going extinct, scientists are figuring out ways to bring back two animals. The idea is that while forests are being cut down, some are being preserved and much more action is being taken to relive those forests' once glory. Or, while some unlucky few are being embarrassed online, many more others are gaining a large benefit for the same reason. Think of how education has changed - even if youth are slightly more inclined to desire to be occupied with a phone, the class parts that they pay attention to are growing exponentially in terms of effectiveness. With the arrival of iPads, SmartBoards, and other multimedia presentation technologies, students are able to learn what was a week's worth of knowledge in the 20th century in a single day today.  Technology is also a new frontier in careers. Not to forget the availability of applications and online work jobs that are improving people's lives, but there are thousands of new prospects for those with a talent in technology. These jobs pay well, and they wouldn't be here without this recent Industrial Revolution. That's another benefit that technology bestows upon us.  Now think of factories. Without an assembly line, robotic arms, or the easy transport of goods, the huge industrial booms of the 20th century could not have been possible. Cars would be more expensive and less frequently used if not for the technological advances that gave people robotic arms, assembly lines, and easy transportation. Cars, specifically, are a perfect example of the way technology has been affecting our lives. At first, production explodes and the environment is taking a big hit, but eventually cars are getting more and more efficient. Now, as technology is really growing fast, cars that run on cleaner sources or cars that run for twice or thrice as long are being sold. People saw that they were hurting the environment and were a quickly growing problem. Now guess what? 'SmartCars' and bicycles are the new preference, and some completely electric automobiles are on the way. It goes to show that while almost every aspect of technology's advance can yield harsh costs, if applied directly, these drawbacks can be reduced to minor issues that aren't important.  On the topic of climate change and the extinction of animals, there has been action diverted to this issue as well. Many new organizations and parks are being created for the preservation of nature, and for the life of animals. In my previous statement, I didn't mean to say that animals were unimportant, but that the people who can choose to collect some money and destroy an acre of forest or do nothing would prefer to rake in the cash. However, people who live like that are quickly being thrown out of their position.  Now on to your statements about terrorism and such, specifically. If we simply cannot come to an agreement with terrorist groups to leave each other alone (which could be made easier by technology, by the way), then the least we can do is use the very same technology breakthroughs to arm ourselves well from any attack they hold on us. Honestly, though, I doubt that if we remove ALL our troops from their country, make up for our troubles with some support for their people, and completely be isolated from those areas, that they will still burn with desire to bomb us. If anyone in power had the idea to try that out and focus on more important internal issues such as climate change or homelessness, well who knows things would change.  With human extinction problems, the current answer has been to build up. That works, really, and it makes for beautiful developed cities, but there is still overpopulation in India and China! Why is this? If you know the geographic phrase 'The rich get richer and the poor have more kids', then you may be familiar with this. Poor families need more children to do more survival farming, but they are still not able to feed them more than the bare minimum, and those kids each have their own children, and it grows extremely quickly. If, say, a more developed government was there to help its citizens instead of dictating the country, this issue wouldn't be happening. In addition, even if this problem would still exist with a helpful government, large apartment buildings or multi-houses can be build with new technologies and help to reduce the overcrowding population in places such as India or China.  The final statement that I want to make clear:  Whatever harms technology will bring due to man's unjust intentions can be reversed and sent flying in the opposite direction as long as attention is brought to the problem. This example is shown well with the evolution of commercial automobiles and the cutting down (and rebuilding) of forestry around the world.</t>

    <t>debate: technolog I gave an example of one animal, great for scientists who are figuring out ways to return animals. But we're not losing just one animal, we're losing tons of animals at a fast rate. This contention alone should win me the entire debate. Same thing with the forest argument. I feel like if you pull across all of my previous arguments from the previous two speeches you should be able to see my point that while things may or may not be preserved.. we are still losing things at a greater rate than we are keeping them.  I agree that education has changed for the better, that isn't my argument. My argument is that kids are more ineffective not only in classrooms, but in everyday life. Communication has been hindered greatly. Yes it is a new frontier in jobs, a new frontier does not mean we benefit from it more than before. We still had jobs and careers before technological expansion.  clean cars are a great thing, they impact the environment a lot less.. I'm aware, but right now in an economy that's not at it's best in the United States.. we can't afford these cars. Almost everyone I know (living in the Midwestern part of the states) can't really afford clean cars.. green cars for example are extremely expensive and there is almost no one who can afford it.  There is still little being about the issue of extinction.. steps take place, but just looking from a real-world perspective we see that so much of the earth is in demise whether it be: Animals who are important to our survival, forests, depletion of the ozone. I've really stressed this in the debate. I think I should win on those arguments if nothing else. Not to mention we're at risk of our own extinction because of these things.  And I don't even want to really discuss terrorism, I think it's implied that carelessness and lack of cooperation has continued (otherwise we wouldn't be so heavily targeted)  ANYONE VOTING ON THIS.. VOTE ON THIS FINAL POINT I WANT TO BRING ACROSS: -Your arguments look like this throughout the entire debate; 'Yes technology does some bad, but it also does good.' I'm saying, 'we were fine before technology because we didn't create bad things.. and the good things are not a necessity for living.' A lot of his arguments (and I pointed this out in the last speech) go around the premise that we need to better learn to manage the way we use technology. Empirically speaking, we aren't willing to learn to manage it in an effective and safe way.  Please vote for the con based on my arguments from all 3 speeches.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank Magic8000 for this great debate. I. The Sun Is Warming Since the Other Planets Are WarmingI admit, the sun is cooling currently, but the correlation between the sun and the climate is reinforced by this by my earlier proof that the Earth's temperature is stabilizing, and thus beginning to cool.The sun is warmer now than at any time in the last 11500 years.[1] 'Moreover, changes in the heliospheric magnetic field have been linked with changes in total cloud cover over the Earth, which may influence global climate change. Here we report that the measurements of the near-Earth interplanetary magnetic field reveal that the total magnetic field leaving the sun has risen by a factor 1.4 since 1964.'[2][3]This can be seen in this graph:    [3]Recently, the sun has cooled compared to recent times. But one, climate lags behind solar activity, and two, this is being seen in the recent temperature slowdown. '... the Sun is now changing from its Solar Grand Maximum to its Solar Grand Minimum. The Earth heats up after a Solar Grand Maximum, lagging a bit after the peak. With a Solar Grand Minimum now on its way, a 'global cooling' may be on the horizon--a natural oscillation occurring in much longer solar cycles.'[4]Changes in the Sun can account for major climate changes on Earth for the past 300 years, including part of the recent surge of global warming, 300 years, including part of the recent surge of global warming.[5]This can also be seen in climate data:    [6]. Longer term, here is a correlation of a solar proxy to a temperature proxy for a period of 3000 years. Values of carbon-14 (produced by cosmic rays, hence a proxy for solar activity) correlate extremely well with oxygen-18 (temperature proxy).  The lower graph shows a particularly well-resolved time interval from 8,350 to 7,900 years BP.  The above graph summarizes data obtained from a stalagmite from a cave in Oman.Finally, we see the correlation between temperature and CO2 amp; solar activity:   [7]. It's easy to see the sun is more determinent.   On the planets, here are some solar system wide effects:  Sun - 'Recent Activity Highest in 8000 Years [meaning it's not just the 11-year cycle] and magnetic field has decreased in size by 25% 300% increase in galactic dust entering solar system Mercury - magnetosphere experiencing significant increases Venus  - 2500% Increase in Green Glow Mars - Rapid Appearance of Clouds, Ozone and'Up to 50% Erosion of Ice Features in one year alone Jupiter - Plasma Torus increasing and'Jupiter's Disappearance of White Ovals since 1997 ' recent increase in storms Io - 'observing same changes -' 200% Increase in Density of Plasma Torus and Ionosphere 1000% Higher Europa - Much Brighter Than Expected Ganymede - 200% brighter Saturn's - Plasma Torus 1000% Denser and'Aurora First Seen in polar regions in recent years Uranus - featureless in 1996, now exhibiting huge storms since 1999 and markedly brighter in 2004 than in 1999 Neptune - 40% Brighter, Near Infrared Range ' 1996 ' 2002 Triton - Severe atmospheric changes, warming Pluto - 300% increase in atmospheric pressure.  [8]. You can't be telling me all of this is a coincidence. Also, on Pluto, it is moving further away from the sun despite the fact it is warming.II. The Sun Via Cosmic Rays Is Causing Global Warming    Looking at the Earth's long climatic history, it is easy to see the correlation:[9]      [10]Low clouds means warmer temperatures: 'Cloud cover has decreased over the past 39 years globally, and temperatures have risen during that time. This global decrease in cloud cover alone could account for all surface warming observed since the 1970s.'[11]So more solar radiation (and galatic positioning) causes fewer cosmic rays, which cause the creation of fewer clouds, which leads to warming. This was confirmed with the Svensmark experiement: 'Preliminary results show that these faux cosmic rays indeed have an effect on the atmosphere: When high energy protons stream in, production of nanometer-sized particles in the atmosphere increases by more than ten times.'[12]In addition, for the predictions made by the AGW theory and the cosmic ray/solar theory, the latter is the effects currently being experienced.[6] For example, the AGW theory predicts the fastest tropospheric warming will be in the tropics, and the cosmic ray/solar theory predicts the warming will be uniform. The surface warming is similar or greater than troposphere warming. The latter theory wins.[6]Finally, it is clear the cosmic ray/temperature correlation:     [6].  'The graph below a correlation between the cosmic ray counts and the global troposphere temperature radiosonde data. The cosmic ray scale is inverted to correspond to increasing temperatures. High solar activity corresponds to low cosmic ray counts, reduced low cloud cover, and higher temperatures. The upper panel shows the troposphere temperatures in blue and the cosmic ray count in red. The lower panel shows the match achieved by removing El Nino, the North Atlantic Oscillation, volcanic aerosols and a linear trend of 0.14 Celsius/decade.'[6]III. Oceans Are Causing Global Warming  'Current research also shows that Earth's oceans are now beginning to cool. It is also now clear that temperatures over the last century correlate far better with cycles in oceans than they do with carbon dioxide; and, the temperature cycles in oceans are caused by cycles of the sun.'[4]The PDO correlates extremely well with global warming, and is not caused by humans.[13] Ocean currents correlate better than CO2:  [14]In fact,  Changes in global atmospheric CO2 are lagging about 11–12 months behind changes in global sea surface temperature, 9.5-10 months behind changes in global air surface temperature, and 9 months behind changes in global lower troposphere temperature.  Changes in ocean temperatures appear to explain a substantial part of the observed changes in atmospheric CO2 since January 1980.[18]  IV. The 1500-Year Cycle   The Medieval Warm Period (MWP) was globally warmer than today, and in both hemispheres:  'Chinese temperatures were 2 to 3 degrees C higher than present during China's climate optimum.' '...during the Medieval Warming... . Temperatures may have been as much as 2.5 degrees C warmer [than today] due to a southward shift of the climate belts.' '...the central Argentinean area had more precipitation during the Medieval Warming than today. Temperatures may have been as much as 2.5 degrees C warmer due to a southward shift of the tropical rainbelts.' 'The largest anomaly was a rapid warming-4 degrees C-between 350 B.C and A.D 450, reflecting a warmer climate in equatorial East Africa.' 'On Signy Island, halfway between Antarctica and the southern tip of South America, there clearly shows the Roman Warming..., the Dark Ages [cooling]..., the Medieval Warming, the Little Ice Age, and the 20th century warming-which is cooler to date than the Medieval Warming.'[15]  From Medieval manuscripts, it is easy to confirm that Europe was warm during the MWP, but so was the southern hemisphere:    [16]. This means it was a global event, and not a see-saw hemisphere event. 'Indirect evidence suggests that the average temperature was as much as 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer [during the Medieval Warm Period] than today.'[17] [17]  V.

    <t>I would like to thank Magic8000 for presenting his arguments. My opponent begins by stating seven premises of global warming that he claims almost all scientists believe. I will leave 1-5 as is, but I will first attempt to counter premises 6 and 7 because those simply aren't true. I. The Temperature of Earth's Atmosphere Has Been Increasing Slightly, but No Longer Continues to IncreaseLooking at the bare temperature statistics, there has now been no net warming since 1997 - 15 years with CO2 rising with no global temperature increase. Since 2003, the trend has actually been negative.'[1]Then why is it that the 2000s had the warmest years on record? 'The “hottest year” claim depends on minute fractions of a degree difference between years. Even NASA's James Hansen, the leading proponent of man-made global warming in the U.S., conceded the 'hottest year' rankings are essentially meaningless. Hansen explained that 2010 differed from 2005 by less than 2 hundredths of a degree F (that's 0.018F).'[2]Here is a graph showing the last 35 years of temperature records, including a trend line: [4] As shown, temperatures are actually beginning to trend downward as the ocean cycles reverse.  This trend is actually set to continue for the next two decades: 'Because PDO cycles last 25 to 30 years, Easterbrook expects the cooling trend to continue for another 2 decades or so.  Easterbrook, in fact, documents 40 such alternating periods of warming and cooling over the past 500 years, with similar data going back 15,000 years.  He further expects the flipping of the ADO to add to the current downward trend.'[3]Even though this contradicts both many computer simulations and the IPCC's official claims, it is clear that they have not been so right before:      [5]That's a negative 0.1 degree C decrease in the last 10 years, contrary to my opponent's claim.     II. The Increase In Global Temperature Does Not Correlate With the Increases of Greenhouse Gases Looking back at history, premise 7 is simply not true:   [6]In fact, CO2 seems to lag behind temperature. 'In fact, the air's CO2 content did not begin to rise until 400 to 1,000 years after the planet began to warm. Ice cores provide a detailed record of local temperature and CO2 concentrations. A study finds that the CO2 increase lagged Antarctic deglacial warming by 800 +/- 200 years. CO2 does not seem to be following that well.'[5]This can be illustrated in this graph:        [7]It is easy to see that CO2 correlates with temperature increases, not the other way around. On a more modern frame,  'In the last decade, there has been no clear warming trend. In the last century, much of the warming occurred prior to 1940, when human emissions of CO2 were relatively small compared to today. During the post-war economic boom (when one would have expected the temperature to rise) the world cooled, from the 1940s till the mid-70s (again, this is evident from accepted data used by the IPCC).'[8]This graph shows the non-correlation of temperature and CO2 in the same timeframe:  [5]Or to take a hot topic of conversation, the Arctic. This century's Arctic temperatures do not really correlate with CO2 increases:   [9]In conclusion, ice core data also shows CO2 count is rising. When examining the temperature and CO2 data, the correlation is striking. CO2 only correlates on a .44 scale (r = .44). This means the correlation rates from “fair” to “poor”, which is bad news for an alarmist. It shows the correlation is not very strong.[10][11]In addition, by the greenhouse theory, both poles should be warming. However, the Antarctic is not (I'll leave the Arctic alone for space reasons): 'If the greenhouse thoery were valid, temperatures in the Arctic and the Antarctic would have risen several degrees Celsius since 1940 due to the huge emissions of man-made CO2... Recently, a team led by the University of Chicago's Peter Doran published a paper in Nature saying, '...our spatial analysis of Antarctic meteorological data demonstrates a net cooling on the Antarctic continent between 1966 and 2000'. The data from 21 Antarctic surface stations show an average continental decline of 0.008 degrees C from 1978 to 1998, and the infrared data from satellites operating since 1979 show a decline of 0.42 degrees C per decade. They report that satellite imaging shows increases in Souther Ocean sea ice parameters from 1978 to 1996 and an increase in the length of the sea-ice season in the 1990s'[12]III. My Opponent's Main Points  I will attack each of my opponent's points one by one. III.i. This is irrelevant, because I already showed that CO2 does not correlate with temperature. III.ii. Again, irrelevant.III.iii. Maybe, but, 'A short-term correlation does not imply that the CO2 increase caused the temperature increase. Causation can be inferred if there is a correlation over several cycles of CO2 concentration changes, with the CO2 change preceding the temperature change. The actual climate history shows no such correlation, and there is no compelling evidence that the recent rise in temperature was caused by CO2. Temperatures have been variable over time, and do not correlate to CO2 concentration. When CO2 concentrations were 10 times higher than they are now we were in a major ice age. As a greenhouse gas, CO2 is vastly outweighed by (natural) water vapour and clouds, which accounts for over 70% of the greenhouse effect. Human-related CO2 emissions soared after 1940. Yet most of the 20th century's world-wide temperature increase occurred beforehand.'[5] This point isn't really relevant either because it's having no effects on the climate.III.iv. Explain further how this is important.  III.v. Actually, this is not happening: '...satellite and high-altitude balloon data confirm that the lower atmosphere is not trapping lots of additional heat due to higher CO2 concentrations. It is hard to know how fast the Earth's highly variable surface is warming, but it is warming faster than the lower atmosphere where the CO2 is accumulating. This is strong evidence that CO2 is not the primary climate factor.'[12] Neither has CO2 caused cooling happened in the stratosphere: '...stratospheric cooling is predicted to occur due to both greenhouse gasses and ozone depletion. The ozone concentration in the stratosphere has declined from 1970 until 1995, and has not declined at all since then due to the implementation of the Montreal Protocol, which limits the emission of ozone reducing CFCs... The lower stratosphere temperature has not declined at all since 1995 (when the ozone levels are stable or slightly increasing), so the data does not indicate any greenhouse gas cooling of the stratosphere. In fact, it appears that there has been a slight warming of the lower stratosphere since 1995, the opposite of what is predicted by computer models of the greenhouse gas effects. The stratosphere cooling indicated by the radiosonde data is caused by the changing ozone concentration, not by greenhouse gases.'[5] In the end, a comparison of the records show that the surface has warmed faster than the troposphere, the opposite of what is predicted by the theory of CO2 warming. Observations agree with the Sun-Cosmic ray warming theory.[5]III.vi. Actually, on wavelengths, 'Comparing the CO2 and H2O absorption spectra shows that much of the CO2 spectrum overlaps with that of water. Parts of the CO2 spectrum are already fully saturated. Adding more CO2 will result in ever diminishing effects as more of the available wavelengths become saturated. The temperature effect of increasing CO2 concentration is approximately logarithmic. This means if doubling the CO2 concentration from 300 ppm to 600 ppm, a 300 ppm increase, causes the temperature to rise by 1 degree C it would take another 600 ppm increase to add a further 1 degree C temperature gain.'[5] Meaning that CO2 cannot have a 1-to-1 linear relationship with temperature, even though most correlation graphs show that.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank Subutai for this debate.My opponent rebuttals summarized.1. Warming stopped in the 90s2. No correlation with CO2 and temperature 2a. CO2 lags temperature2b. Antarctic isn't warming2c. Climate in the 40s3. My main points 1. Warming stopped Con says James Hansen claimed the hottest year records are meaningless. We need the context here, just what Con posted it seems like Hansen was saying the differences between 2005 and 2010 were meaningless and small, not that it wasn't the warmest year. So it's a red herring and does nothing to rebut the actual record.Con commits 2 fallacies to prove his claim here, category error and a sweeping generalization. You can't make long term signal claims based on short term noise and this is exactly what Con is trying to do. A large impact on short term temperatures can happen, such as El Nino (Con posted a chart that points out El Nino, but Con doesn't seem to take this in account and still claims that global warming stopped.) El Nino is an oceanic cycle that can suppress global warming for a while, but these cycles do nothing about long-term trends. [1]Foster and Rahmstorf used several tools to filter out short term noise to show the true long term trend [2] [3]  You can see the complete removal process in the first videoI'm curious why Con posted the first chart, as it actually proves my point. Skeptical Science explains [4]   Trend lines showing the sudden jump in temperatures in the 1995 La Niña (Green lines) and the 1998 (Pink lines) El Niño events. Brown line indicates overall increase in temperatures.The chart above clearly shows that temperatures have gone up...The overall trend from 1979 through November 2010 (Brown line) shows an unmistakable rise.Air temperatures are not the only or even the best way of determining the trends of warming. Most of the heat goes into our oceans [5]. So if Con's claim is correct, we should see a drop in the ocean’s heat records too. However the records show that the Earth is indeed warming, as if 1995 was nothing special.  [6] [7]The claim is unsubstantiated and debunked.2. No correlationAs said above, there can be short term cooling over long term trends -such as La Nina- because CO2 isn’t the only forcing that exists. It's a well established fact in physics that Co2 does cause warming. To claim there can’t be a correlation is a contradiction to well established physical discoveries. [8]2a. CO2 lags temperatureCO2 doesn't always initiate warming, as I said in my opening statement a forcing can naturally change climate. Co2 did however amplify the warming in times past, in fact roughly 90% of the global warming happened right after the CO2 increase. The Antarctic ice core data does show changes in the CO2 does follow the changes in temperatures by about 800 years. However, we can't conclude that CO2 always lags temperature, as to do so would be another compositional fallacy. The changes in the temperature at that time are because of the changes of the Earth's orbit causing the Earth to obtain more seasonal sunlight. Why a lag?The lag is easily explained. As it’s just the Milankovitch effect. When ocean temperatures rise, the oceans will release more CO2, then this release will contribute the warming trend, causing more CO2 to be released . Thus CO2 can lag and lead [9]Shakun et al has shown that historically CO2 has mostly led temperatures“...Here we construct a record of global surface temperature from 80 proxy records and show that temperature is correlated with and generally lags CO2 during the last (that is, the most recent) deglaciation...These observations, together with transient global climate model simulations, support the conclusion that an antiphased hemispheric temperature response to ocean circulation changes superimposed on globally in-phase warming driven by increasing CO2... [10]See the second video for more information2b. Antarctic isn't warmingA paper produced by nature concluded 'Central West Antarctica among the most rapidly warming regions on Earth' [11]. The Arctic argument can be debunked with what was already said above.2c. Climate in the 40sThe cooling was because of global dimming by aerosol emissions. This argument assumes a strawman, that CO2 is the only thing that controls climate. No proponent of A.G.W. claims this. The claim is that CO2 is the main driver of today’s warming.Take Mount Pinatubo for example. It dropped temperature, but this doesn't debunk CO2 correlations. Same in the 40s. There was a lot of aerosol pollution, volcanic activity, and solar forcing. All together this explains the cooling and doesn’t debunk my contention.   [12][13][14]This is a well known effect called global dimming [15]3. My main pointsSince I’ve debunked Con’s claims, 1-2 are now relevant3. I don't understand why Con says this is a short-term correlation or that it's irrelevant. As the source studied the heat loss since 1970 and it’s relevant as the heat would come back causing warming. Con then repeats what's already been debunked. CO2 is the main driver of climate today. Some things such as water vapor isn’t a forcing agent, it’s a “feedback loop” as when CO2 levels go up, more water vapor gets in the atmosphere [16]. Con’s rebuttal is not really relevant to the argument.4. Skeptical Science explains it better than I could.“If an increased greenhouse effect was causing warming, we would expect nights to warm faster than days. This is because the greenhouse effect operates day and night..if global warming was caused by the sun, we would expect the warming.. to be greatest in daytime temperatures.... we observe is a decrease in cold nights greater than the decrease in cold days, and an increase in warm nights greater than the increase in warm days... This is consistent with greenhouse warming.” [17]5. From what I found on google the source of what Con posted is from the book 'Every 1500 years, Unstoppable Global Warming' [18]. However it's a poor source, since I couldn't find the actual paper that's referenced. I do know there's a paper by John Christy and Roy Spencer that showed the troposphere was warming slower than the surface [19], which would be a problem in our current models. The information in these papers soon turned out to be false, as there were several errors made during the study. The adjustments that Christy and Spencer used at first was incorrect, but when the data was adjusted correctly, it was shown to be no problem in the climate models. [20] [21]All data now shows warming in the troposphere and cooling in the stratosphere. [22]The lead authors (including John Christy) said this on the first page“Previously reported discrepancies between the amount of warming near the surface and higher in the atmosphere have been used to challenge the reliability of climate models and the reality of human-induced global warming... This significant discrepancy no longer exists because errors in the satellite... New data sets have also been developed that do not show such discrepancies.'Con is clearly using outdated sources.6. The claim has actually already been refuted by my argument 6 and 3. In order for CO2 to be saturated, more CO2 shouldn't add an additional greenhouse effect.  'What they found was a drop in outgoing radiation at the wavelength bands that greenhouse gases such as CO2 and methane... The change in outgoing radiation over CO2 bands was consistent with...expectations. Thus the paper found 'direct experimental evidence for a significant increase in the Earth's greenhouse effect...This result has been confirmed by subsequent papers using the latest satellite data... the observed differences in CO2 bands matched the expected changes based on rising CO2 levels. Thus we have empirical evidence that increased CO2 is preventing longwave radiation from escaping out to space.[23] Thanks again Con! Let the voting begin! </t>

    <t>I would like to thank Magic8000 for accepting this debate. I. The Universe and Global WarmingThe current state of the Galaxy and our Sun is affecting our temperatures.I.i. The Rest of the Solar SystemThe Sun clearly is in a warmer phase, because all of the other planets have increasing temperatures as well. 'In 2005 data from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor and Odyssey missions revealed that the carbon dioxide 'ice caps' near Mars's south pole had been diminishing for three summers in a row.Habibullo Abdussamatov, head of space research at St. Petersburg's Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory in Russia, says the Mars data is evidence that the current global warming on Earth is being caused by changes in the sun.'[1]''Global warming on Neptune's moon Triton as well as Jupiter and Pluto, and now Mars has some [scientists] scratching their heads over what could possibly be in common with the warming of all these planets … Could there be something in common with all the planets in our solar system that might cause them all to warm at the same time?''[2] Two things can be drawn from this. One, that if other planets are warming, that it is only natural for the Earth to be warming as well. And second, that even if all these planets did have natural causes, then that is a sign of Earth's natural climatic change, instead of man-made. I.ii. The Position of the Milky Way GalaxyEvery approximately 135 million years, Earth enters a more populated area of the Milky Way, and as a result, more cosmic rays hit the Earth, which causes cooling. Currently, we are in a less populated area of the Milky Way, which means that less of these cosmic rays will be hitting the Earth, which means less cloud formation, and of course, warming. [3] for the source on this hypothesis. The sun can also cause this through evaporation.II. Earthly CausesThere are many internal causes of Global Warming as well. II.i. Ocean Current Anomalies Ocean temperature anomalies seem to be rising-along with the temperature. '...one can model past temperatures as a linear trend (that started well before CO2 was added in any substantial quantity) and periodic bumps... ...temperatures over the last 100+ years look a lot like a linear trend plus ocean cycle-driven bumps'[4] What is causing all the bumps?: [4]As shown in the graph, the PDO, or ocean currents, temperature has affected the average Earth's temperature.    II.ii. Clouds: A Continuation of Point I.ii.I mentioned about the position of the Milky Way Galaxy and the Sun in regards to these 'cosmic rays'. Here is a more in depth look at the effects of position. 'The implications, if true, had potentially enormous implications for the debate about natural causes of warming. When the sun is very active, it can be thought of as pushing away cosmic rays from the Earth, reducing their incidence. When the sun is less active, we see more cosmic rays. This is fairly well understood. But if Svensmark was correct, it would mean that periods of high solar output should coincide with reduced cloud formation (due to reduced cosmic race incidence), which in turn would have a warming effect on the Earth, since less sunlight would be reflected back into space before hitting the Earth.Here was a theory, then, that would increase the theoretical impact on climate of an active sun, and better explain why solar irradiance changes might be underestimating the effect of solar output changes on climate and temperatures.'[4]'Since he first suggested his hypothesis over a decade and a half ago, Svensmark and other researchers have slowly been putting together research to test it.' The results were: 'Scientists found that when shielding was removed and natural cosmic rays allowed to hit the chamber, cloud seeding increased dramatically, and it increased substantially again when additional artificial cosmic rays were added. Svensmark appears to have gotten it right.'[5] Proof here is in the next points. III. The 1500-Year Cycle This has to do with a cycle of the climate that can explain the warming. 'Through at least the last million years, a moderate 1500-year warm-cold cycle has been superimposed over the longer, stronger Ice Ages and warm interglacials.'[6]  Here is a graph related to this:  [7]There are two things we can conclude from this graph. First, that up-and-down cycles are normal for the long-term climate. This century's global warming is nothing new. The second thing we can conclude, is that today's global warming is not as bad as the Medieval Warm Period's peak yet, and the Medieval Warm Period was less than the Holocene Maximum Period.    'Even more important, the earth is not 'the warmest it has ever been.' In fact, the earth was much warmer during the Medieval Warm Period when human agriculture flourished!'[7]'The scientists found evidence that on average, every 1,470 years, plus or minus 500 years, cold, ice-bearing waters, which today circulate around southern Greenland, pushed as far south as Great Britain.'[8] There seems to be a full cycle of up-down-up temperatures of the climate every 1470 years. And this goes as far back as at least 1 million years ago. Currently, we are in an upswing of temperatures, just coming off of the Little Ice Age, the peak to be in a few hundred years, making the peak-to-peak difference between today's global warming and the Medieval Warm Period a little less than 1500 years. So today's Global Warming is a natural, cyclical occurence.    IV. The Sun: The Proof of Theories I.ii and II.iiThe sun's cycles have a lot to do with temperatures also.  'In this chamber, 63 CERN scientists from 17 European and American institutes have done what global warming doomsayers said could never be done — demonstrate that cosmic rays promote the formation of molecules that in Earth’s atmosphere can grow and seed clouds, the cloudier and thus cooler it will be. Because the sun’s magnetic field controls how many cosmic rays reach Earth’s atmosphere (the stronger the sun’s magnetic field, the more it shields Earth from incoming cosmic rays from space), the sun determines the temperature on Earth.'[9]'Svensmark matched the data on cosmic rays from the neutron monitor in Climax, Colorado, with the satellite measurements of solar irradiance from 1970 to 1990. Over the period between 1975 and 1989, he found cosmic rays decreased by 1.2 percent annually, amplifying the sun's change in irradiance about four-fold'[6]So, as the sun's activity increases, so does the temperature. This below graph shows the correlation:   [10]This graph clearly shows that temperature goes up and down with solar activity, because an increase in solar activity directly correlates with an increase in average temperature 1-2 years later. And as a final side note, I would like to present this graph that helps disprove the anthropogenic cause theory, regarding again, ocean temperature anomalies:     [4]So 'nature' created the same temperature trend as 'humans' did.</t>

    <t>To save on space I will summerize my opponents arguments1. The sun is warming since other planets are warming.2. The sun via cosmic rays are causing global warming.3. Oceans are causing global warming.4. We’re going though a 1500-Year Cycle4a. The Medieval Warm Period5. Temperature of 1895-1946 vs 1957-20081. The sun is warming since other planets are warming.The sun isn’t warming at all, in fact it’s cooling. A study by Usoskin in 2005 debunks the claim that the Earth is warming due to a warming sun. He writes '...during these last 30 years the solar total irradiance, solar UV irradiance and cosmic ray flux has not shown any significant secular trend, so that at least this most recent warming episode must have another source.' [1]In fact, the sun has been contributing to some cooling in the past few decades. [2]Other studies have also debunked the claimA study by Erlykin says“We deduce that the maximum recent increase in the mean surface temperature of the Earth which can be ascribed to solar activity is 14% of the observed global warming.' [3]'Although solar and volcanic effects appear to dominate most of the slow climate variations within the past thousand years, the impacts of greenhouse gases have dominated since the second half of the last century.' -Ammann [4]'The variations measured from spacecraft since 1978 are too small to have contributed appreciably to accelerated global warming over the past 30 years.'- Foukal [5]So what about the other planets? First off Con commits the fallacy of composition, his reasoning is “if 1 planet is warming naturally all planets are warming naturally”. You must agree other planets are very different from Earth.Mars: Observations show Mars is experiancing short term regional warming, but not long term global warming. [6]Pluto: MIT scientists explain “Pluto’s orbit is much more elliptical than that of the other planets, and its rotational axis is tipped by a large angle relative to its orbit. Both factors could contribute to drastic seasonal changes.” [7]Jupiter: Global warming isn’t happening on Jupiter, it’s predicted. It's said to warm not because of the sun, but because “the loss of these atmospheric whirlpools, the average temperature on Jupiter will change by as much as 10 degrees Celsius, getting warmer near the equator and cooler at the poles,' [8]Neptune: Neptune is warming. Its orbit is 164 years, our observations are less than a third of Neptune's year. The climate modeling of Neptune says Neptune is undergoing a seasonal change into summer. [9]This also would cause Triton's atmosphere to become thinner, causing warming. [10]2. The sun via cosmic rays are causing global warming.Looking at the data disproves this hypothesis. While cosmic rays are high the temperature is also high.Annual average GCR counts per minute (blue - note that numbers decrease going up the left vertical axis, because lower GCRs should mean higher temperatures) vs. annual average global surface temperature (red, right vertical axis)From NOAA [11], The Neutron Monitor Database [12], and Skeptical Science [13]'between 1970 and 1985 the cosmic ray flux, although still behaving similarly to the temperature, in fact lags it and cannot be the cause of its rise. Thus changes in the cosmic ray flux cannot be responsible for more than 15% of the temperature increase'- Krivova [14]'galactic cosmic rays appear to play a minor role for atmospheric aerosol formation events, and so for the connected aerosol-climate effects as well.'- Kulmalahttp://www.atmos-chem-phys.net...Correlations between low clouds and cosmic rays broke in 1991, then cloud cover began to lag cosmic rays by 6 months [15] ,even though cloud formation should happen within a few days [16]Svensmark said the loss of correlation was because of long term calibration drift in ISCCP satellites, but the ISCCP themselves disagreehttp://www.realclimate.org...Sloan and Wolfendale pointed out Chernobyl disaster should've produced increased cloud cover according to this hypothesis, but there was nonehttp://arxiv.org...'In this chamber, 63 CERN scientists from 17 European and American institutes have done what global warming doomsayers said could never be done — demonstrate that cosmic rays promote the formation of molecules that in Earth’s atmosphere can grow and seed clouds,”This was based off a false understanding of the CERN paperSee the first video.3. Oceans are causing global warming.The oceans would cool when its heat goes to the atmosphere. Observations show oceans are warming [17]. The oceans are actually good evidence for the resolution.'the observed ocean heat-content changes are consistent with those expected from anthropogenic forcing, which broadens the basis for claims that an anthropogenic signal has been detected in the global climate system.' [18]4. 1500-Year CycleCon makes another category error here. There’s defiantly a 1500 year climate cycle. We know that from ice core data from Greenland -as Con cited-, but these events known as the “Dansgaard-Oeschger events” don’t increase the global temperature. It’s only a temperature shift or a see-saw temperature change in the 2 hemispheres. [19]Also see the second video.4a. The Medieval Warm PeriodCon cites the Medieval Warm Period to try and prove his claim about the 1500 year cycle. However there’s no evidence that shows the MWP was as warm globally as it is today.NOAA says“In summary, it appears that the late 20th and early 21st centuries are likely the warmest period the Earth has seen in at least 1200 years.” [20]and“The idea of a global or hemispheric 'Medieval Warm Period' that was warmer than today however, has turned out to be incorrect.” [21]Here’s the differences5. Temperature of 1895-1946 vs 1957-2008At the very end Con posts a chart of the temperature of 1895-1946 and 1957-2008. Both are very similar and seem to prove climate change is by nature. Based on data from Hadlet, GISS, NOAA, NCEP R1, NCEP TCR, ERA-40, and AMTI, Skeptical Science formed these 2 charts around those time periods. It’s close enough to see the claim is wrong[22]Back to ConSources in link below[1] </t>

    <t>'On the rebuttals, apologies. I misworded the debate structure. It should be 'no rebuttals by pro.' Just present your arguments affirming the resolution. Thanks.'As said by Con, I will present my argumentsThe typical argument is like this [1]  The Earth's atmosphere keeps the planet much warmer than it would be without an atmosphere.  The main gases which contribute to this are carbon dioxide, methane and water vapor. Collectively these are called greenhouse gases.  The ability of these gases to act as greenhouse gases can be shown in a laboratory.  The quantity of these greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has increased sharply since the Industrial Revolution, and their concentration continues to do so.  The concentration of these gases has increased as a consequence of human activity.  The temperature of Earth's atmosphere has been increasing and continues to increase.  The increase in global temperature correlates with the increases of greenhouse gases. Just about every scientist agrees with these 7 premises. Even some skeptics do too and I believe Con does (although I could be wrong). The following premise is the disputed one8. The increase in temperature has been caused by the increase in greenhouse gases from humans.We know the climate on Earth has changed before. We must understand that in order for a climate to rise naturally, A forcing must exist to force the climate to change. There's no known forcing that fits the fingerprint of the evidence we see, except one, anthropogenic greenhouse gases.We know that humans are producing 30 billion tons of Co2 a year in the atmosphere [3]. Let's see evidence that follows from this.I will paste 6 evidences from “10 Indicators of a Human Fingerprint on Climate Change” [2]1. When we measure the type of carbon accumulating in the atmosphere, we observe more of the type of carbon that comes from fossil fuels [4]2. This is corroborated by measurements of oxygen in the atmosphere. Oxygen levels are falling in line with the amount of carbon dioxide rising, just as you'd expect from fossil fuel burning which takes oxygen out of the air to create carbon dioxide [5]3. So we know humans are raising CO2 levels. What's the effect? Satellites measure less heat escaping out to space, at the particular wavelengths that CO2 absorbs heat, thus finding 'direct experimental evidence for a significant increase in the Earth's greenhouse effect'. [6]4. If an increased greenhouse effect is causing global warming, we should see certain patterns in the warming. For example, the planet should warm faster at night than during the day. This is indeed being observed [7]5. With the lower atmosphere (the troposphere) warming and the upper atmosphere (the stratosphere) cooling, another consequence is the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere, otherwise known as the tropopause, should rise as a consequence of greenhouse warming. This has been observed [8]. This also contradicts the hypothesis that the earth is warming because of solar activity.6. ....A closer look at the downward radiation finds more heat returning at CO2 wavelengths, leading to the conclusion that 'this experimental data should effectively end the argument by skeptics that no experimental evidence exists for the connection between greenhouse gas increases in the atmosphere and global warming.' [9] [10]The resolution is affirmed[1] From http://rationalwiki.org... all references for the premises are within that[2]</t>
<h> As said by Con, I will present my argumentsThe typical argument is like this. The Earth's atmosphere keeps the planet much warmer than it would be without an atmosphere.</h>

    <t>1st water is a renuable resource and we shouldn't worry about whether or not it takes more water for a cow then wheat, because it is all going to be renewed and if we chose not to eat those cows they would consume more water to live longer.  You could post the arguement to that that plants create oxygen and when we eat more and more plants that is depleting the oxygen so if everyone turns vegetarian we will start running out of oxygen. Neither of these I believe will have a big effect on humanity I believed was just stating the parralex argument that seemed to work with it.  Second We don't need to worry about fossil fuels causing climate change ohh that's right they used to call it global warming but since they were wrong and it didn't exist they changed it here is why climate change is false, 'Those who belive that there is no evidence for global warning often argue that extremely accurate temperature gauges that can measure temperatures to within .01-degrees Celsius have shown no evidence of global warming over the last 25 years. While some can consider this a plateau, these satellite readings correspond with land readings taken for years before this; there has been little recorded climbs in temperature.  Scientific Debate While many scientists are willing to go on record to point out trends in global warming, more than 17,000 scientists have signed a petition circulated by the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine saying that they see no evidence of global warming at all. Less formal surveys amongst climatologists have pointed in the same direction.  No Future Prediction While it is tempting to look ahead at what global warming could do if left unchecked or untreated, it is currently impossible to predict actual climate change in this manner. There are currently no computers sophisticated enough to extrapolate from current data in a reliable pattern that can indicate future climate temperatures.'(1)  Next I would like to say why animal rights shouldn't be a question. If you are an evolutionist you believe in survival of the fittest and that the better smarter species will weed out the lesser species, yes of course now days we try and keep a couple around but working against extinction of animals is very condridicting if your an evolutionist.  If you area Christian or Catholic or Mormon or Judiest you believe in the Torah 1st five books of the bible which say man is to rule over all the animals, 'Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.'(2)  So to all those religions their God says it is ethical to eat and rule over them.  And you say that it matters that a cow has 80 percent human DNA so they are part human well you also sited that rice is 15 percent well that means that are also part human so if you believe one you have to believe the others or that's almost unethical to say one human cousin is more important then the other. That is if you believe that which I don't. I'm going to start a Rice rights group  Rights for  Intellectual  Creatures that shouldn't be  Eaten  Rice lol  Now we should attempt better conditions for these animals like maybe put them to sleep before they are slaughtered not that it matters that much what an animal is feeling.  Most people fight for animal rights and no pain for animals but they believe abortion is fine they are just as alive in that stomach as some animal is but that child is going to grow into a living breathing human that could be having a debate like this in the future,so if you count feeling pain as a sign of being alive like a human you better not be an abortion supporter,'With the advent of sonograms and live-action ultrasound images, neonatologists and nurses are able to see unborn babies at 20 weeks gestation react physically to outside stimuli such as sound, light and touch. The sense of touch is so acute that even a single human hair drawn across an unborn baby's palm causes the baby to make a fist.  Did you know that this 20-week-old unborn child can feel pain? Surgeons entering the womb to perform corrective procedures on tiny unborn babies have seen those babies flinch, jerk and recoil from sharp objects and incisions.  'The neural pathways are present for pain to be experienced quite early by unborn babies,' explains Steven Calvin, M.D., perinatologist, chair of the Program in Human Rights Medicine, University of Minnesota, where he teaches obstetrics.  Medical facts of fetal pain Anatomical studies have documented that the body's pain network'the spino-thalamic pathway'is established by 20 weeks gestation.  ' 'At 20 weeks, the fetal brain has the full complement of brain cells present in adulthood, ready and waiting to receive pain signals from the body, and their electrical activity can be recorded by standard electroencephalography (EEG).' ' Dr. Paul Ranalli, neurologist, University of Toronto  ' An unborn baby at 20 weeks gestation 'is fully capable of experiencing pain. ' Without question, [abortion] is a dreadfully painful experience for any infant subjected to such a surgical procedure.' ' Robert J. White, M.D., PhD., professor of neurosurgery, Case Western University  Unborn babies have heightened sensitivities Unborn babies at 20 weeks development actually feel pain more intensely than adults. This is a 'uniquely vulnerable time, since the pain system is fully established, yet the higher level pain-modifying system has barely begun to develop,' according to Dr. Ranalli.  'Having administered anesthesia for fetal surgery, I know that on occasion we need to administer anesthesia directly to the fetus, because even at these early gestational ages the fetus moves away from the pain of the stimulation,' stated David Birnbach, M.D., president of the Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology and self-described as 'pro-choice,' in testimony before the U.S. Congress.  Given the medical evidence that unborn babies experience pain, compassionate people are viewing abortion more and more as an inhumane and intolerable brutality against defenseless human beings.  The unborn baby at 20 weeks Fetal development is already quite advanced at 20 weeks gestation:  ' The skeleton is complete and reflexes are present at 42 days.  ' Electrical brain wave patterns can be recorded at 43 days. This is usually ample evidence that 'thinking' is taking place in the brain.  ' The fetus has the appearance of a miniature baby, with complete fingers, toes and ears at 49 days.  ' All organs are functioning'stomach, liver, kidney, brain'and all systems are intact at 56 days.  ' By 20 weeks, the unborn child has hair and working vocal cords, sucks her thumb, grasps with her hands and kicks. She measures 12 inches.'(3)  Your last point about healthy sets doesn't have to do with ethics but I would like to see a test where they eat a doctors alloted mount of meat and healthy vegetables because the average American is a meat eater and the average American is obese so that test doesn't really work.  My conclusion  Eat meat there is nothing unethical about it.  It is a great source of protein.  And it tastes darn good and just the fact that eating a nice steak can make a good day for someone that's proof enough for me that it's a good thing.</t>

    <t>Thank you for accepting. :)Let's begin.Ecological ConcernsIn 2006, the United Nations calculated that the total climate-change emissions of animals bred for meat was 18% of the global total; this is more than cars, planes, and all other transportation combined. Besides greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide, cows and pigs produce many other polluting gases.It takes 108 pounds of water to produce one pound of wheat. It takes a pound of beef around 20,000 pounds of water. Farming uses 70% of the water available to humans.The majority of plant food grown on farms is used as animal feed. It takes 8.4 kilograms of plant-food to produce 1 kg of pork. The 7 billion livestock animals in the US consume 5 times as much grain as the entire population directly consumes. A Cornell analysis states: 'Animal protein production requires more than eight times as much fossil-fuel energy than production of plant protein while yielding animal protein that is only 1.4 times more nutritious for humans than the comparable amount of plant protein,''Each year an estimated 41 million tons of plant protein is fed to U.S. livestock to produce an estimated 7 million tons of animal protein for human consumption. About 26 million tons of the livestock feed comes from grains and 15 million tons from forage crops. For every kilogram of high-quality animal protein produced, livestock are fed nearly 6 kg of plant protein.''If all the grain currently fed to livestock in the United States were consumed directly by people, the number of people who could be fed would be nearly 800 million,''More than 302 million hectares of land are devoted to producing feed for the U.S. livestock population -- about 272 million hectares in pasture and about 30 million hectares for cultivated feed grains.''On average, animal protein production in the U.S. requires 28 kilocalories (kcal) for every kcal of protein produced for human consumption. . . . Grain production, on average, requires 3.3 kcal of fossil fuel for every kcal of protein produced.'So, by producing meat, the population loses a vast majority of protein. In addition, the amount of energy and land used is far greater than that of plant food. On top of this, the soil erosion and greenhouse gases produced by raising livestock makes it far less sustainable than plant foods.All these facts are from:http://www.guardian.co.uk...http://www.news.cornell.edu...Animal RightsThe first thing to address here is the most basic question, 'why should we care about the plight of the animals involved?' Ok, that's valid. After all we're humans, we have to look out for our own species first. However, we are the most intelligent of animals (probably), so we can examine ourselves and other species logically. Modern science concludes that humans evolved from other animals, specifically apes. Since we evolved from these creatures, they are basically distant relatives (of course, plants are much more distant relatives). Coming from the same ancestors, we have many similarities to other animals, especially mammals. The DNA of the chimpanzee is 98% identical to that of humans. Of course, not many of us eat chimpanzees. The cow's (Bos taurus) DNA is 80% similar. (Source 1) On the other hand, we share 15% with a rice plant. (Source 2) So what does this similarity mean? This brings us to animal intelligence. A dog, for instance, is thought to hold an intelligence that measures up to a 2 to 2.5 year old human. (Source 3) Pigs are thought to be more intelligent. Some apes are able to communicate with humans via simple sign language. Some chimpanzees have been found to perform some intellectual tasks better than humans. (Source 4) This isn't to say they are more intelligent than humans, it's just a testament to the fact they are somewhat intelligent.It is the widely accepted by scientists that an animal's brain complexity is directly linked to their ability to feel pain and suffering. The Discovery Channel stated, 'Psychologist B.F. Skinner proved that animals feel pain in a clinical test in which animals were shocked with electrical current as they approached their food.' (Source 5) A recent study indicates that even crabs feel pain. (Source 6)Ok, so we've established animals are somewhat intelligent and can feel pain (similarly to that of a young child). Now, does the meat industry cause suffering to the animals used?Well, take a look. A pig's natural lifespan is 15 years, pigs are generally killed for pork at 6 months of age. Male pigs are usually castrated without anesthetic. They often have their tails removed and teeth clipped. Many pigs die in the bad conditions of transit. (Source 7)In 2010, 62 billion animals died for American food. Here's the ones that made it to the slaughterhouse:23,627,000 ducks35,330,800 cattle110,367,000 pigs242,619,000 turkeys8,790,478,000 chickens7.3 billion fish12 billion shellfishIn 2010, the average meat-eater's diet is responsible for 207 animal deaths. At that rate, it is around 16,000 animals over the course of a person's lifespan. (all from source 8)Human ConsumptionThe above arguments must be balanced with this. How is meat useful to humans? Humans are, after all, naturally omnivores. However, there is much research that indicates humans lived almost solely on plant matter as recently as 10,000 years ago. (Source 9 and 10) This isn't to say they were strict vegetarians, like the great apes, they very occasionally ate meat. However, it is likely that humans ate much less meat than they do today.Probably the hardest arguments about vegetarianism is health. Can you be healthy without eating meat? Well, apparently, vegetarians live on average 8 years longer than regular meat-eaters (this is comparable to the difference between smokers and non-smokers). (Source 11) The protein and vitamins of meat can be derived from vegetable sources, except without the cholesterol and fat. That's not to say that all vegetarians lead a healthy diet, if they replace meat with high-fat dairy, it does little good. But, on the whole, vegetarians live longer.ConclusionToday, we live in a society where it is possible (and beneficial) to choose a vegetarian diet. Perhaps in some parts of the world, eating meat may impact health or survival. But if you aren't in poverty, you don't need to sacrifice health to abstain from meat. Therefore, for us, eating meat is a choice of leisure, rather than need. A vegetarian diet greatly lessens our ecological impact and decreases the food we need to produce. A vegetarian diet undoubtedly lessens the hardship on animals as well as other human beings. I would call that more ethical.Nothing will benefit human health and increase chances for survival of life on Earth as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet. -- Albert Einstein. </t>

Though fresh water is replenished by the water cycle we have a limited amount at a given time and it takes vast amounts of energy (non-sustainable) to treat the water. In 50 years, our population will increase by 3 billion people. It will become increasingly difficult to provide water for everyone.  You can read about it here: http://www.whyzz.com...  Also, you say that if we didn't eat the cows, they would consume the water anyway. The meat industry breeds these animals in MASSIVE quantities. They are forced to reproduce much more frequently than if they were wild. If we stopped breeding them for slaughter their numbers would decrease dramatically in a few years. Also, you did not consider that meat production not only takes the water the animals drink directly, but all the water it takes to grow the food they eat.  You state that if we all switch to eating plants, we would decrease the world plant population and thus decrease the oxygen on earth. Most of the plants farmers grow are fed to meat animals. If we switched to plant diets there would be more plants, and, according to you, more oxygen. http://www.news.cornell.edu......  About global warming, if you don't believe it is a concern, I'm not sure what to tell you.

Survival of the fittest is not a code of conduct for life, it was never intended to be that. Evolution does not define morality.  Just because something behaves a certain way in nature does not make it ethical (e.g. causing other species' extinction).  97% of scientists accept evolution as scientific truth. This does not change what is ethical. http://www.people-press.org... I want to bring to attention that this is not a religious debate. It is a debate on ethics, which to some people does include religion, so I will address it briefly.   I am a protestant Christian and I think that evolution is probably true. I don't see a conflict between Christianity and evolution. God has the power to bring about life on earth in the way he chooses. I believe this way to be evolution. All the life on earth shares some percentage of DNA. This makes sense if you believe they come from the same Creator.  You mention that the Bible gives authority to man to rule over the creatures of the Earth. Does this mean we can do whatever we want to them? No, we must take care of them. Before the flood, God forbade the eating of meat. After the flood, he designated certain animals as “clean” to eat. Does this remove our responsibility to rule over the creatures with respect?  Here are some other things the bible has to say: 'The wolf and the lamb will feed together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox, but dust will be the serpent's food. They will neither hunt nor destroy on all my holy mountain,' says the LORD.” -Isaiah 65:25 “The godly care for their animals, but the wicked are always cruel. “ - Proverbs 12:10  “Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain. “ -Deuteronomy 25:4  “But ask the animals, and they will teach you, or ask the birds of the air, and they will tell you. Speak to the earth, and it will teach you, or let the fish of the sea tell you. Every one of these knows that the hand of the Lord has done this. The life of every creature and the breath of all people are in God’s hand.” -Job 12:7-10 (NCV)   Many early Christians were vegetarian, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, John Chrysostom, and Basil the Great to name a few. In some early church writings, Matthew, Peter and James (Brother of Jesus and first leader of the New Jerusalem Church) were all vegetarian. Clement wrote, 'It is far better to be happy than to have your bodies act as graveyards for animals. The Apostle Matthew partook of seeds, nuts and vegetables, without flesh'.   God giving us dominion over the animals does not give us license to mistreat them. God rules over us, and he is merciful to us. We rule over the creatures of the earth, should we not be merciful?    I do not think we should give rice plants rights. We only share 15% of our DNA with it. Plants have no brain, no central nervous system. There is no reason to think that plants have emotion or feel pain.There is a reason to think animals have emotion and feel pain. Animals are closer to us than plants, some animals are very close to us. Even bacteria share about 2% of our DNA. Does this give them rights? No. When you wash your hands, you kill thousands of bacteria. If you have ever felt pain, than you can surely understand why we should hesitate to inflict pain on the things that can feel it (animals, not plants and bacteria).  I agree with you about abortion. For the same reasons I think we should not kill animals, I feel we should not kill unborn humans. But this debate isn't about abortion.  Human Consumption  I'm not sure what you are saying about the health implications of a vegetarian diet. 8 years more of life is 8 years more of life. To me, that indicates it is healthy to be a vegetarian. Yes, there are many healthy, long-lived people who eat meat, but a diet without meat can be just as healthy (or possibly more-so). http://www.huffingtonpost.com......  You conclude: “Eat meat there is nothing unethical about it.”  18,000 children die every day for lack of food. If the entire nation switched to a completely plant-based diet, there would be 5 times more protein food than the meat produced. We feed farm animals enough to feed 800,000,000 people every year. This world needs all the extra food it can get. http://usatoday30.usatoday.com... “And it tastes darn good and just the fact that eating a nice steak can make a good day for someone that's proof enough for me that it's a good thing.“  Well, maybe punching my neighbor in the nose would “make a good day” for my neighbor's ex-wife, but that doesn't make it ethical.

    <t>Thank you for bringing up the “humane” options for meat. I think these are definitely better for the animals involved. As long as the animals are treated as well as they say and they are killed swiftly, I think it is just as ethical as a vegetarian diet. I really hope more people do get into that.  :D Before I close, I must address the seeming inconsistency in my position. The resolution of the debate is “A vegetarian diet is more ethical than a meat-eating diet.” I define “meat-eating” in the rules of the first-round. Let me quote myself from the first round of the debate:   “By a 'meat-eating' diet, we'll just assume the average U.S. consumer (rather than a strict organic meat-eating person).“   To determine whether it is ethical to eat meat, we must look at what people TYPICALLY do, not what people CAN do. People can choose organic or “ethical” meat, but the truth is that 99% of the meat we eat in America (and most developed countries) is factory-farmed. As I stated in the first round, my argument is for the “average U.S. consumer” not the oddball 1% that choose ethically raised meat.   Ethically raising animals takes more land. It would be impossible to set aside enough land to pasture-raise animals in order to feed us. To provide everyone animal products at the rate we consume, we have to confine livestock animals into small cages and make there lives unusually short. Some fifty-five billion land animals are raised and slaughtered each year world wide for agriculture. That's about 8 times the global human population, each year. Animal production occupies 80 percent of the Earth’s total usable arable land. Would it be possible to farm all of these animals with enough space to allow free movement? Would it be possible to let them live longer and still produce the same amount of meat overall? No. It wouldn't be possible. That is why only 1% of the meat we eat is not factory-farmed.   So, organic or “humane” meat is better for the animals involved, which is definitely good, but it is not necessarily better for the people. Pasture-raising animals provides just as much strain on the environment as factory-farming the animals. Also, pasture-raising animals takes more land and time to produce the same amount of animals, meaning less food.   I'm not arguing for factory-farms, there are definite benefits to moving away from that type of farming. However, not everyone could eat pasture-raised meat for lack of land. Luckily, there is another option. A vegetarian diet takes far less land and produces more food than an organic or non-organic meat based diet.   However, you don't have to completely avoid meat to reduce ecological strain, increase the world food supply, and decrease animal suffering. More people eating less meat can have the similar effect; this too is more ethical than eating excessive meat.   Conclusion  As more countries become developed, the issue continues to grow. The Telegraph reports, “China now eats twice as much meat as the United States and must rein in its appetite or face a food crisis, one of the country's leading farm experts has warned.“ The average Chinese person eats around 52 kg of meat yearly while the average American eats 124 kg. Some experts predict that within 40 years time, we may all have to switch to a vegetarian diet to avoid catastrophic water shortages. Read more here: http://www.telegraph.co.uk...   In addition, it has been determined that a diet of meat is not necessary for survival or health, at least for those in developed nations. The American Dietetic Association states:    'Vegetarian diets offer a number of nutritional benefits, including lower levels of saturated fat, cholesterol, and animal protein, as well as higher levels of carbohydrates, fiber, magnesium, potassium, folate, and antioxidants such as vitamins C and E and phytochemicals. Vegetarians have been reported to have lower body mass indices than nonvegetarians, as well as lower rates of death from ischemic heart disease; vegetarians also show lower blood cholesterol levels; lower blood pressure; and lower rates of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and prostate and colon cancer.'    Source: American Dietetic Association. (2003). Position paper on vegetarian diets. J Am Diet Assoc, 103, 748-765.    For those in developed nations such as America, eating meat is a leisure. It is not necessary for survival or health, and there is much research that indicates too much meat can harm a person. It takes on average 41 grams of plant protein to produce 7 grams of animals protein (not to mention the extra water and energy used). The 7 billion livestock animals in the US eat 5 times the grain the entire human population eats.    Eating meat is less ethical than a vegetarian diet because:     Meat production strains the environment far more than plant production, partly because animals eat the majority of crops we grow. Also, animal production produces more greenhouse gases than all transportation of any kind combined.   Meat production wastes food that could be fed to humans. It is like taking the food, and throwing 83% of it into the trash. 18,000 children die every day of starvation. We need more food.   Modern cost-driven meat production causes mass suffering of animals. 55,000,000,000 farm animals are killed yearly. 99% of those in America (around 7 billion animals) are bred, raised, and killed on a factory farm.      If eating meat was necessary for health or survival, these three results listed above MIGHT be justifiable. It is pretty shaky though. But it has been proven that meat is not necessary for health or survival, at least for those in developed countries.  I'm not trying to say eating meat is completely unethical. It certainly has a place our culture and our history. It used to be necessary for survival. But today it isn't. This makes eating meat in a developed country LESS ethical than not eating meat. A vegetarian diet has potential to improve conditions for animals, but more importantly it can improve the lives of the people of the world.     I want to thank you for participating, Locke33. You've brought to my attention some new issues and interesting ideas. You've been patient and a great opponent.</t>

    <t>No need for apologies. I hear you, school absolutely does suck. I'm glad we can find some common ground though.   Let me clarify my position a little. Personally, I don't think eating animal flesh is wrong in itself. I think if a person doesn't cause an animal pain before slaughter, kills it swiftly, and this action doesn't hurt any other person, there is nothing unethical about the consumption of the meat. I see 3 problems with the ethics of eating meat:     Factory farming causes great pain for the entire life of the animals involved. 99% of the animals we eat are raised and slaughtered on a factory farm.   Meat production in mass quantities causes ecological problems. Three-quarters of the world's agricultural land is devoted to raising livestock, either for grazing or for growing feed.   Meat production causes us to have less food. Meat returns a fraction of the food we put into it. A study in 2011 found that if we ate less meat, the world food supply could double.     On the health issue, this isn't directly related to ethics. What I'm saying about health is that a person (in a rich country at least) can be JUST as healthy without eating meat. So, eating meat is a preference rather than a necessity. I do agree that more tests need to be conducted about a balanced meat and vegetable diet, rather than extremes.   You mention people in poor countries who rely on meat for survival, such as Eskimos and tribes in Africa. These people are not the worst offenders. If they continued their practices, we'd be fine. They can't afford factory-farmed meat and they don't produce animals an a massive scale. What they do is NOT unethical.   But the reality is that the poor don't consume or produce much meat in comparison to rich countries. Over 80% of meat eaten in the world is consumed by people in the richest half of world countries. We in rich countries are the main offenders. The average American eats around 280 lbs of meat per year (more than recommended for health), the average person from Sierra Leone or the Republic of Congo eats only 10 lbs of meat. Why should Americans eat more meat than recommended while people from other countries have little food at all? It is the excess of rich countries like America that is unethical, not the small tribes of the world.   Let's address the issue of eating plants, which sometimes share 15% of our DNA. Who says we shouldn't discriminate between different forms of life when choosing what to eat? After all, we must eat something that is alive. Everything that is alive shares some of our DNA. If we didn't discriminate between different forms of life, we would starve.   Let's look at it this way. Humans share 99% of there DNA between each other, humans are obviously not ethical to eat. Bacteria shares around 2% DNA with us, we kill and eat bacteria constantly, every day. But that's OK, because it is unavoidable and bacteria doesn't feel pain. A plant shares a little more DNA with us, around 15%. They are not much more like us than bacteria, plants also don't feel pain. However, a cow shares more than 5 times the DNA with us than a rice plant, 80% similar to ours. It is proven that cows feel pain.   Isaiah 1:11-17 (NIV) 11 “The multitude of your sacrifices—what are they to me?” says the Lord. “I have more than enough of burnt offerings,of rams and the fat of fattened animals; I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats. 12 When you come to appear before me, who has asked this of you, this trampling of my courts? 13 Stop bringing meaningless offerings! Your incense is detestable to me. New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations— I cannot bear your worthless assemblies. 14 Your New Moon feasts and your appointed festivals I hate with all my being. They have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them. 15 When you spread out your hands in prayer, I hide my eyes from you; even when you offer many prayers, I am not listening. Your hands are full of blood! 16 Wash and make yourselves clean. Take your evil deeds out of my sight; stop doing wrong. 17 Learn to do right; seek justice. Defend the oppressed. Take up the cause of the fatherless; plead the case of the widow.”  God may have called for sacrifices of animals at one time, but it was always more important to “defend the oppressed.” After the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, animal sacrifices became obsolete. This matches the message of compassion Jesus brought.   Excuse me, but I don't understand how I did not refute the statement that if we all ate plants only, we'd have an oxygen shortage. Less plants are killed by a vegetarian diet than a meat diet. This is a fact, it is not disputable. It takes 41 tons of plant protein to produce 7 pounds of animal protein. Most of the plants we grow are fed to animals, who inefficiently convert it to animal protein, losing 83% of the protein in the process. 3/4 of the world's agricultural land is used for livestock production, which provides less food for us than plants. http://www.news.cornell.edu...   Again, I don't think eating meat is unethical in itself. Two-hundred years ago, I don't think it was unethical at all. It is the processes of the modern meat industry that cause undue animal and human suffering. It is the 99% of the modern meat industry that is unethical. </t>

    <t>First I will start with quoting what my opponent said in the start of the last round, 'Let me clarify my position a little. Personally, I don't think eating animal flesh is wrong in itself. I think if a person doesn't cause an animal pain before slaughter, kills it swiftly, and this action doesn't hurt any other person, there is nothing unethical about the consumption of the meat.  You can get meat this way today it costs more money but you can. Since you said there is nothing wrong ethically with eating meat, there really is no argument. Something can't be more ethical then something else if it is completely ethical. Here is some proof of humane meat out there this is one of many, 'Wouldn't it be great if farm animals were raised compassionately? Well, some people are way ahead of you on that. Whole Foods Markets has decided to come up with standards to create a line of meats bearing an 'animal compassionate' label, meaning farmers raised the animals humanely. It's not the first animal-welfare label out there. There's also the 'certified humane' label administered by Humane Farm Animal Care, and the 'free farmed' label overseen by the American Humane Association. And the Animal Welfare Institute issues the label 'Animal Welfare Approved.'  All aim for humane lives for farm animals, though each program is different. Examples: The New York Times pointed out that the Animal Welfare Institute and the 'free farmed' label let pigs have nose rings to prevent them from tearing up the ground when they root around, but the other programs forbid rings. At AnimalWelfareApproved.org, the Animal Welfare Institute posts a comparison chart showing how it's the most favorable program.  The nonprofit watchdog group Consumers Union so far has examined only the 'certified humane' label, which it deemed a 'highly meaningful label that indicates that meat, dairy and egg products came from animals that were treated humanely,' according to its eco-oriented web site, Eco-labels.org. The 'certified humane' label has several requirements. Among examples: Livestock must have access to clean and sufficient food and water; they must have sufficient room to move naturally; and their environment must not endanger their health.  In the end, the vast majority of livestock don't fall under any of these humane-labeling programs, and you may achieve your goal of buying humanely raised meats via other routes -- by buying from farmers markets or small local farms. Another way: Quiz local co-ops about what they know about how their meats were produced.  For more info:  To find out where to buy 'Certified Humane' foods, go to CertifiedHumane.com. To find Animal Welfare-approved foods, go to www.AnimalWelfareApproved.org. To find 'Free Farmed' producers, go to AmericanHumane.org.'(1)  So I really have nothing else to say as long as you get humanly raised meat like up above me and my opponent both agree eating meat is completely ethical and since eating a vegetarian diet is completely ethical, they are both equally ethical and that's the debate.  So basically whenever you eat meat make sure you get humanly raised and slaughtered meat and then you will be eating just as ethically as a vegetarian in both mine and my opponents eyes.  Good luck with your closing statement in the last round remember no rebuttals or new arguments, like we agreed. Lets end this.</t>

    <t>1st no need to opologise we share some of the same beliefs like evolution in creation. I believe based on proof that micro evolution is an important part of what goes on in the earth. That is the only proven part of evolution. But that's for another debate.  Many more people in foreign third world country's would go hungry with out the ability to eat meat. How bout the Eskimos or Inuits meat is a vital food source in a place that's unforgiving, what about tribes in Africa even more of there kids would be go hungry without meat, especially in the small untouched tribes.  We still need to test a balanced diet of meat and vegetables against a all veggie diet to conclude that no meat is healthier.  If we should not kill a living thing because it is 85 percent human then why should we be able to kill one that is only 15 that's a little bit discriminating if we are going to go to the point of 85 percent human DNA means a animal is a sentient bien.  Yes we should rule over them with care not slaughtering them, but why would God require living animals as sacrifices if they were sentient. And Isaiah 65:25 is a prophesy of the 1000 year reign when animals will live together in peace and there will be no wars. But that again is another debate I will save escatology for later. :)  I never said evolution was a guidelines of life but why would anyone who believes in it want to mess with the natural cycle of the earth.  Yes we do breed lots more cows now but they would eventually get way larger in population then now and consume just as much water just like our population continues to increase.

    <t>Overpopulation is the root of many political conflicts and virtually all environmental problems. Aside from avoiding nuclear war, lowering the human population needs be set as a top priority. The limits of the human population are debatable, but the repercussions of having more then 7 billion humans inhabit the planet are not. One could argue that the issue at hand isn't the current population per se, but rather, it is the exponential growth of the human population that is a cause for concern. Data suggests that the world population grows by two percent each year. Some speculate that another two billion will be added to the world population by the year 2030. This rate of growth is far beyond reasonable. Overcrowding in poorer nations can cause countless immigrants to flee to many western nations as well. This is a large factor in the growth of richer nations as well. For example, the U.S. population will grow by over 100 million by year 2050. Either way, overpopulation has played the leading role throughout history in famine, warfare, political organization, political disorganization and arguably countless other social problems.  The conflicts that arise from overpopulation are often very obvious. For example, the spread of disease is magnified by a dense population; overcrowding invariably leads to territorial disputes; and in order for a society to maintain sustainable consumption rates of natural resources, higher populations require lower per-capita consumption rates. Problems such as climate change, pollution, and soil erosion can all be attributed to the fact that the number of humans far exceeds this planets capacity.  Logic would state that any given population should be able to survive solely off of their natural, immediate environment, and in the case that required resources or an abundant food supply is not readily available, the group may migrate, in the best interest of survival, to another region in order to meet their needs.  Possibly one of the largest contributing factors, however, is the overproduction of food. After the birth of agriculture, the ability to produce food outgrew the need, and the overabundance of it led to an intense population explosion. Overproduction of food allows for more people to be born and, therefore, allows for a greater population. Human population growth is a rapidly cycling positive feedback loop in which food availability drives population growth. Some suggest that advancement in medical science is the greatest influence over the population. Medical science and technology greatly affect the mean life expectancy, but play a small part in the population equation.  No matter what the definitive cause, the Earth simply cannot sustain more then 7 billion humans. If humans are to survive on this planet, we need to drastically begin to reduce our population. Coupled with conservation efforts and the spread of environmental awareness, we might stand a chance, but overpopulation is nothing short of a crisis, and needs to be addressed with urgency.</t>

    <t>You are simply wrong.  Again, our population increase is slowing down greatly. There is not a single country on earth who's fertility rate is is larger today than in 1960. Everywhere (except in Khazakstan) fertility rates are falling, and they keep falling faster and faster, and they will fall below the replacement rate. Currently in half the world fertility rates are below the replacement rate.  The pattern is this: mortality falls, causing a population boom, then a few decades later fecundity falls suddenly and rapidly.  The UN's best estimate is that the world population will start falling after reaching a peak at 9.2 billion people in 2075.  And again, there is plenty of food. At 7 billion people we keep eating better and better every decade and agricultural production keeps going up and up, and will continue to do so thanks to (among other things) GM crops, better irrigation methods, etc, as I described in post 1. Food is not a problem in the least.  We won't destroy forests for housing. There is no need to. The world population will become more urbanized, requiring less and less space per person as people move into dense cities and live in multistory apartments.  The world is not becoming polluted either. There have been various scares in the past such as predictions that by 1985 you would need a gas mask to live in the USA and Rachel Carson's prediction of a cancer epidemic caused by chemicals. It is total nonsense. The quality of air in western countries is better than it has been since the beginning of the industrial revolution and is continuing to get better. The same goes for water. Our waste management (filters for cars, water purification, etc) is better than ever and keeps getting better. Preventing pollution is largely a simple matter of lawmaking. Do not panic, the sky is not falling.  Fresh water is abundantly available to everyone not living in extreme poverty in deserts. There is no impending catastrophe of water wars, or whatever. Water isn't destroyed: the water you flush down your toilet is purified and can be used again. Our drinking water is purer than ever. Water comes from the sky and from underground and it can be made by purifying salt water. In fact, global warming on average will cause more rain. This means more fresh water. The warmth and water also means more arable farm land and more food.  Everything you said stems from completely irrational pessimism and your gut feel on how things will go. Your view doesn't take in to account any actual evidence on the subjects and you see no possible change in sight. If something can't keep on going forever, it won't.</t>

    <t>I urge you to read 'The Rational Optimist' by Matt Ridley, where he goes into ALL of these issues in wonderful depth.  I will try to keep this short because I have to wake up in 6 hours.  The population will not go on increasing as the world becomes healthier. Indeed as you know, in many western countries the fertility rate is so low that the populations are decreasing. Where the fertility rate is high and rising, it is rising slower all the time. If I remember correctly, he argues that the world population will not go much above 10 billion.  Sufficient food can be made with continuing agricultural advancement. This involves GM crops, urbanization, proper methods of irrigation (water pipes under the soil, already in use), fertilization etc. Arable surface area can be increased with things such as multistory fields, etc.  The fears related to global warming are greatly exaggerated and the effects occur slowly, they are easy to adapt to and easy to manage in fact global warming will increase the amount of arable land. Global warming can conceivably even be reversed given the right engineering solutions.  There is less war, conflicts and violence than ever before and the world is becoming more peaceful continuously. Trade between nations is an engine for peace, prosperity and progress.  The problem of diminishing natural resources (oil, coal) is greatly exaggerated, with more and more oil and coal being found all the time. Also historically there has been a trend of 'peak ' crises which have never come true (e.g. fears in the 19th century that coal would run out). People will start using other energy sources than fossil fuels.  The planet can easily sustain much more than 7 billion people, no sweat.  About predictions: global famine fear mongering has been going on forever, with books like Famine, 1975! and The Population Bomb. For example early editions of the latter book by Paul Ehrlich he promised (in the 70s) this: 'Hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash program embarked upon now. At this late date nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate...'  People seem to be in a sense hardwired to be pessimistic about the future regardless of the evidence or past experience. They look at the way things are going now and extrapolate to the future assuming things won't change, just as The Times of London estimated in 1894 that there would be 9 feet of horse dung on every street of London by 1950. I think you are doing exactly this.</t>

    <t>Too much of anything is bad, no matter what the argument is. Big is better if it is contained. More is better if there is control. Anything that is excessive is definitely destructive. Overpopulation is one of them.  For the animal kingdom, a large number of members in a group are an advantage when you talk about dominance of the area. There will be more members who will defend and stay guard to protect their territory and their group. On the other hand, a large group of animals will be in a disadvantage when it comes to feeding their group for they must hunt and kill more than other groups who are on an average number.  The same goes with the human race. An overpopulated community needs a lot of supply of basic necessities to support their existence. Basic needs like clean water, staple food, shelter and clothing are now posing a problem for some parts of the world. Lack of basic needs leads to starvation, chaos and deaths.  Our planet earth has limited resources and there will come a time when the whole world will be overpopulated and will need to ration all meager resources just to provide for the peoples existence.  For now, the situation is not yet overwhelming but the signs are already here for the past decade or so. We have the phenomenon of El Ni'o and La Ni'a, Global warming and famine on some parts of the world. These are the effects of overpopulation of humans. We are producing products which we need for our daily activities and this are done by factories and plants that emits dangerous chemicals, toxic wastes and some other forms of hazardous materials which contributes to the degradation of our planet.  Overpopulation is a world issue. This is threatening not only our planet and our lives but also our race and all the things here on earth. There should be a concrete plan to arrive at a concrete solution for this problem. Otherwise, we may start to count the time for our planet. Many people are now considering other planets or moons where the human race will start a new life and make a new earth. In any way, even if that dream will become a reality one thing is for sure. Humans will still overpopulate any place wherever our race will go.  Is overpopulation a world threat? Yes, it is a world threat.</t>

    <t>Rebuttals:  1. My opponent claims I have 'contradicted' myself. This is untrue. I argued consensus was irrelevant, however according to my opponents reasoning he loses the point because the majority of climate specialists and scientific organizations support my position. If I said consensus is always wrong, my point would be defeated. However disproving your point then arguing its irrelevancy isn't really a contradiction. It's merely extra information. Pointing out that 1) you are wrong and b) the point is irrelevant anyway weakens your point even further. My opponent then claims 'more scientists' agree with him. Problem with numbers much? A list of names and a poll are two different things. Take the whitehouse petition. One petition, which has 32,000 signatures, argues Senator Feinstein should be impeached... because she supports an assault weapons ban [1]. However, 58% of the public supports such a ban [2]. A list of scientists and a massive scientific survey are different things. Surveys are more accurate as they include all groups of the population they are polling, lists merely show one opinion (not the other, one sided analysis) making it unreliable. And again, as stated, the vast majority of the signers are not specialists in climate, making the list irrelevant. My data stands on the issue showing a vast consensus from climate experts. Whether my argument, consensus is irrelevant, or my opponents, its the be all and end all, I win this point as I have shown consensus on my side (or) the irrelevancy of the point.  2. Strawman by my opponent. I did not refute his predictions, I merely pointed out the data the predictions are based on is bogus. The predictions are based on the claims of current cooling. I rebutted in two ways: First, I noted a small trend out of a longterm trend is irrelevant showing the same could have been done in earlier decades however the long term trend is up. Secondly, I noted he world isn't cooling at all, nor is it flat-lining. I showed the rate of warming is the same as in earlier decades (1990s, when the warming was exceptional). My opponents argument:  'In the last ten years the earth has gone from warming to cooling. The global temperatures are expected to decline for the next two decades. This does not need very much arguing because it is backed by pure fact.'  I did not jump the gun on anything. I noted the first part of this, the earth is cooling currently, was false. That is based on the 1998 el Nino artificially changing the trend, and when this is accounted for the earth is still warming. If the first part is wrong, the following assumptions have no evidence behind them. Therefore, my opponent has decided to dodge my rebuttal instead to strawman the point: claim I only argued predictions. will reiterate my point: 'Studies accounting for many factors, such as the 1998 El Nino, and others, conclude the earth is still warming at the same rate it was in the 1990s.' I showed it is still currently warming, I did not focus on any prediction whatsoever. My opponent claims I am dodging the point, which is false, and mostly is a cop-out argument. Anyone who cared to read round two can see that this is false.  3. I didn't dodge anything, this is a pure red herring. I didn't think I would have to use semantics for an obvious point. Lets do this like a first grade teacher so we can all get this.  Class, what is the resolution? Humans cause Global warming Mr. Adams. Good. Does the economics of preventing global warming relate to the cause of global warming. No.  The economics of preventing global warming is irrelevant to what causes it. Let's use a probably poor analogy but its all I can think of: what causes the battery on my laptop to die? Usage of the device. To fix it, I must charge it. But wait, its bad to charge it because I have to walk!!! (I am not saying you are wrong by making a bad analogy on the costs of charging, by the way). But does the cost of charging it relate to what is causing it? No, not at all. What is causing the problem is an independent variable to the costs of fixing the problem. Many people support the global warming theory because the facts support it, but oppose mitigation due to its effects on the economy. The fix is irrelevant to the cause, and if you read the resolution the cause is what the debate is about. The point is irrelevant. I am not dodging anything, you are landing an argument where its easier for you to argue but is irrelevant to give the illusion you have one (one) of the points made in the debate. Its a red herring.  DEFENDING MY CASE  1. My opponent merely argues I have source spammed. Although I usually do, this isn't really source spam. I gave data points and observations from multiple studies showing humans are the cause of global warming. When you present data, is is courteous to cite the source. Source spam would be this.  'Global warming is natural' No, its not. Link times 100  I cited the data and the observations in the study. If my opponent wants, I can provide the methodology next round or in a PM so he can ridicule the results. Presenting a study, its results, and, if needed, a short explanation is not source spam. The argument is simple:  1. We emit greenhouse gases (we agree upon this). 2. Natural factors likely don't cause the current warming (we disagree here). 3. Man-made factors explain the modern warming (we disagree here). 4. Therefore, warming is man-made (obviously we disagree on the conclusion).  For 2, I showed the sun had no correlation with temperature since the 1980's and said '. Sun Spots, overall, have no trend proving they likely do not cause the modern warming phase. The current sun spot number is like it was in 1913, when it was very cold, unlike this year, again showing the sun- not a candidate for modern warming'  Yeah, providing data and a lack correlation is such a weak argument...  For three, I provided data points based on multiple regression analysis which happens to be done by many academic studies showing man likely has caused the modern warming.  My opponent merely drops my case with no ounce of rebuttal, it's like he is not even trying. I could expand on my argument, with more data and observations. Actually I will, let's hope this isn't spamming.  My argument was he majority of data supports my position. I provided data. Instead of refuting it, my opponent ignores it with the cop-out argument of source spam. I showed co2 caused the current warm phase. Let's take another route.  CO2 causes the current warming, as shown by many points of evidence. CO2 causes warming, as many measurements have shown. CO2 is a greenhouse gas. When more CO2 and methane are added to containers, the amount of outgoing radiation decreases, providing evidence of the CO2 warming effect. The amount of outgoing radiation is falling as temperatures increase, indicating a strong correlation between CO2 and temperature. These data points have been shown by surface and satellite temperature datasets. CO2 has caused the earths energy imbalance causing the modern warm period of man made origin [3]. I am low on room, so that is all I can say. Data backing up my assertions can be found here. And last round, but thats somehow spam. ====== Am I really dodging arguments? Are my points of data weak enough to be dismissed because I have sources? Am I dropping points that are irrelevant anyway? Am I missing something on the earth is cooling point by demonstrating it is in fact not cooling, and even if it is that is irrelevant? I will let the voters decide. But really, my case has not beaten defeated and my opponents lack of showing should be noted by the voters.  References are here: http://pastebin.com...</t>

    <t>I would like to thank my opponent’s response.   Rebuttals:   1. First, consensus is irrelevant to science. Galileo opposed consensus, Einstein opposed consensus. As Einstein noted, it only took one person, one paper, to disprove his theory. Further, getting a mere list actually does not represent the opinion of climate scientists. Other scientists are irrelevant (except geologists and meteorologists). The majority of debate only happens in political literature, not scientific literature. There is actually a consensus in favor of global warming. No major scientific organization opposes man-made global warming. 97% of climate scientists say global warming is man-made. Although this point is mainly irrelevant, the opposite of my opponents argument is true [1]. 2. Long term trends cannot be decided in 15 years. Richard Muller, former skeptic, website notes, “Some people draw a line segment covering the period 1998 to 2010 and argue that we confirm no temperature change in that period. However, if you did that same exercise back in 1995, and drew a horizontal line through the data for 1980 to 1995, you might have falsely concluded that global warming had stopped back then. This exercise simply shows that the decadal fluctuations are too large to allow us to make decisive conclusions about long term trends based on close examination of periods as short as 13 to 15 years.”[2] Many temperature datasets do not include the Arctic where it has been warming. Studies accounting for many factors, such as the 1998 El Nino, and others, conclude the earth is still warming at the same rate it was in the 1990s [3]. 3. Stopping global warming and its effects on the economy are irrelevant to what causes the warmth. This is totally irrelevant in this debate.   Case 1. Many studies indicate the overall human impact on global warming is far greater than the natural impact, interestingly many natural impacts are having a cooling effect on the warming. Teet et al. 2000 finds human activity caused over 100% of the warming from 1940 – 1997. How do you get 100%? Natural forcing’s causing a cooling effect, meaning we reversed those factors and caused warming. Meehl et al. 2004 finds humans caused 80% of the warming in the last century. Stone et al. 2007 found we caused almost 100% of the warming in the last 60 years. In a second paper, he noted humans caused 50% of the warming, the other half displaced by areosols, and the sun and volcanoes were responsible for 13 and 37% of the warming. Lean and Rind 2008 finds humans have caused 80% of the modern warming. Sott et al. used the same approach of Lean and Rind, but finds humans have caused 86% of the global warming. Huber and Knutti 2011 finds humans have caused 75-100% of the modern global warming. Foster and Rhmstorf 2011 finds that humans have caused 100% of the warming in the last 60 years. Gillet et al. 2012 finds we caused over 100% of the modern warming, as it had to overstep cooling effects and cause warming, making it over 100% [4]. 2. The sun, what my opponent argues causes global warming, is not the cause of modern warming. Sun Spots, overall, have no trend proving they likely do not cause the modern warming phase. The current sun spot number is like it was in 1913, when it was very cold, unlike this year, again showing the sun- not a candidate for modern warming [5]. 3. Scientific bodies have ruled out natural factors, man-made theory is the only possible thing left. Conclusion: Humans are the cause of global warming. </t>

    <t>Thank you Pro for accepting this debate.  I believe global warming is not real and any temperature change is caused by the sun. I have three main points to back my argument.  1. People believe in global warming because political figures do 2. The earth is cooling 3. 'Global Warming' hurts jobs  1. My sources say that the majority of scientists studying climate change will say that global warming is not true. About 17,000 scientists agree with the fact that it is not true. How can we possibly agree with something that is not proven by fact? The reason people believe that global warming is true is because major political figures believe it and say it is true. Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Al Gore, and many others are examples of my point. The fact is people believe this because people they trust believe, not because of fact.  2. In the last ten years the earth has gone from warming to cooling. The global temperatures are expected to decline for the next two decades. This does not need very much arguing because it is backed by pure fact.  3. If we continue to believe global warming as a society, we will lose millions of jobs and be less energy efficient. If we cannot use oil, cannot use coal, and cannot use nuclear power, how do you expect any country to be energy efficient? You can't. Without these ways of producing energy, America will lose jobs and we will be forced to find new methods of energy which will cost billions.  I believe I have proved my points and I await pro's case.  Sources: http://www.aproundtable.org... http://www.forbes.com...</t>

    <t>Refutations:  1. You just countered your own argument. You said that the number of scientists does not matter yet you argue that because more scientists agree with global warming it is true. In fact more scientists actually agree with me, your source is not reliable. You also dodged the majority of my argument. My point was people believe what political figures tell them to. My argument was not pure fact like yours.....  2. Just because I said it is PREDICTED that the earth would continue cooling does not mean that was my entire argument. Yes I did say that, but people that believe in global warming say the earth will continue getting 'warmer' It is called argument anticipation. My main argument was that the earth is getting colder by temperature change that we have observed and experienced. You dodged most of my argument because you cannot argue with fact.  3. If we continue to believe in global warming then we will lose jobs. I think that the effects of the belief would go with the debate so I would say you dodged this argument as well.  To counter your case I will say that I can get a bunch of sources to back my opinion too but that does not make a case, or a debate. You should get some actual arguments instead of plain sources because that is not what debating is. You use sources to back your arguments not the other way around.  As my main points were either halfway refuted or ignored completely, I will not be providing new points and I ask voters to give arguments to me for a poor case on pro.</t>

    <t>Hello, Mac, and I am glad you instigated this debate.   My opponent’s arguments rely on three main contentions:   1)   Global warming is real and is a threat 2)   Global warming is caused by human activity 3)   We should attempt to stop global warming   I will refute them as follows:   1. Global warming is real and a threat   My opponent’s main point here is the expected sea level rise. However, some scientific papers have been released showing the sea level rise has been over predicted and that in many parts of the world, sea level rise isn’t happening at all. The IPCC’s data claiming massive sea level rise has been grossly exaggerated and is utterly incorrect. For example, Bangladesh should have been engulfed in water, or should be seeing significant problems. In 2007, the IPCC proclaimed their doomsday. However recent data shows the sea levels there are not rising [1].   My opponent also forgets the possible benefits of Global Warming. For example, parts of Canada, Russia, and Argentina too cold for industrialization and farming would become reachable. Historically, warmer temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere acted as a benefit for the Vikings. Greenland and Iceland’s productivity rose, the increased rain caused better harvests, and lead to the Vikings making landfall in the New World. The increased CO2 would make plant growth easier and enhance the world, making it muck more habitable. Some of the warmest periods in our history, the world flourished with resources aplenty; a warmer climate could easily be good for you and me [2].   My opponents other point here is the reality of global warming, and here I agree. There has been an overall warming trend since 1850, however I dispute current warming. Global warming stopped in 1997, with an overall decrease in temperature since then. Using NOAA data starting from 2000, to avoid the El Niño year in 1998 (which ‘refutes’ the global warming stopped theory) shows no change. A slight decrease in temperature, although the trend is less. There has been no warming since 1997, and no statistically significant warming since 1995 [3].   2. Humans are the cause of global warming    This is the main contention of the debate; if it is awful, but natural, we can’t stop it: changing our ways of life would be worthless. If it is still happening but is natural, we can’t stop it and changing would, again, be a pointless exercise. So, I explain the reasoning on why claiming humans cause global warming is illogical.   First, CO2 and other emissions increase during a good economy. After the 1940’s, a post-war economic boom occurred. At this time, when CO2 increased, is when scientists said humans first began to have a large impact on global warming. Interestingly, temperatures decreased at this time. Alarmists have tried to counter these claims, but their logic fails to hold up [4].   Either way, my opponent has only assumed humans are the main cause of the warming; he has given little evidence himself that we are the cause.   Correlation is always an argument in this debate. People have argued there is a strong correlation between CO2 and temperature, however this is simply untrue. CO2 only correlates r= .44, with 1 being perfect and 0 being none at all. This means the correlation rates fair to poor. The sun scores better, with an r= .57, meaning it rates to fair to good. And the PDO correlates the best, with an 0.83 rating good [5]. It seems hard to argue CO2 causes the warming when it fails to correlate to a degree of ‘good’ and its rivals for the title—the sun and the PDO—correlate much better then it.   Further, the current warming should have been predicted, as according to Singers 1,500 sun cycle the current warming was right on time. The majority of geologists—about 50%—believe global warming is a natural cycle and the current warming is right on time [6].   Other explanations, like cosmic rays, also seems like a possible factors. In short wording: Humans likely do not play a major role in global warming, although we likely exacerbate the situation a little bit.   3. It should be stopped—specifically with green energy   If my opponent wishes to bring up another solution, I am all ears. However he currently argues green energy is the solution. Lets go down the list:   a) Wind power   There is a simple problem with wind: the fact that wind is not always blowing, and its upfront capital costs more then outweighs the fact that wind, itself, is free. Wind itself has lees value then its fossil fuel competitors and must be placed in areas with constant (or higher then average) wind amounts, limiting its universality. Unlike Fossil fuel plants, which can be planted anywhere. There is other, in my opinion more real, issues then global warming. Wind stations kill the avian populations and take up a lot of space, often ruining natural beauty. Many rodents actually like the wind farms and live inside the fan. Rodents—a food source for many predators—get killed trying to eat them. And, obviously, other birds will fly through the places and get whacked and die. Some Wind projects take 10 billion pounds of raw materials. If we assume global warming is man made, the CO2 created by the mining and construction often times shrinks the overall benefit. b) Solar   Potential market chare for solar has been overestimated time and time again and the subsidies that the industry relies on—because it is not competitive with fossil fuel because the marker does not favor it—costs millions of dollars, even more then the Wind subsidies. Thermal solar plants need 1,000 times more the resources fossil fuel plants need. Some studies argue:   “Solar Two looks good on paper, and it is expected to provide steady baseload electricity as well as late afternoon peaking capacity, but the future of all the central solar generators is in doubt. They are expensive to build, their very scale escalates financial risks--as with nuclear power--and their massive height (in excess of 200 meters) may attract opposition.”[7]   Other Solar industries (there are many) require millions of dollars to operate and to even be on the market and commercialize their products. Many environmentalists have a actually given up on some solar markets, like photovoltaic, in favor of nuclear (something they usually despise) because of the destruction of those solar plants.   c) Hydro   Even environmentalists have left hydro power, uttering the power source in the same breath as they do natural gas, coal, and nuclear. From a conservative standpoint, the construction of Hydro power is actually very invasive on the surrounding community and cost millions. On a more liberal note, the hydro plants take a lot of resources to build and kill and disturb many fish populations. The cost of current hydro plants are 5-6 times more expensive per kilowatt hour then other fossil fuels.   d) Case study: Michigan   There has been no net job growth because of their green energy, they have created jobs in one sector but have taken them away from another. Their energy prices have increased and their prices continue to increase. Other states, like North Dakota, have welcomed fossil fuels and have had a net job growth and prices fall. Studies have shown for every one job created in their oil industry, another three are created because of decreased energy costs [8].   CONCLUSION:   I have proven my opponents premises to be incorrect and his solution of green energy is impractical, harmful to the economy, and, sometimes, not even green.

    <t>1. Global warming is real and is a threat      It was implied that there was global warming, because if there wasn’t this debate would be futile. Hence my wanting to bring it up. My opponent has claimed there has been no rapid changes in climate before. This is untrue, according to the 1995 IPCC our warming really isn’t unusual at all.       So my opponent and I agree, on balance it has warmed since the 1800s, but we differ on when it stopped. My opponent has been vague on the 1995 tipping point, saying it is a true statement but we are seeing the effects of global warming. This makes little sense, however, because if global warming stopped over 10 years ago why are we seeing the effects now? Regardless, the hurricane theory is a weak one. In the 1990s, for example, hurricanes were rare and not intense. Since the 1940s, the National Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory finds that the number of hurricanes and the intensity of hurricanes have actually been falling [1]. In the past 50 years, not one decade experienced an above average amount of hurricanes (7 is the average – where we are in our current decade). Within the last 50 years, an average of 5.6 hurricanes hit the US. In the 50 years before humans supposedly began to cause global warming, the average was 8.4 hurricanes—an overall downward trend [2].   Since 1900, the US hurricane intensity trend has flat lined, and decreased since the 1950’s intensity has fallen [3].   My opponent has also argued Global warming has caused droughts. Plotting the drought severity index over the last 60 years, a new paper published in Nature shows little trend in droughts throughout the world [4]. My opponent links GW to the dust bowl, which is actually odd: even climate scientists arguing humans caused global warming claim we had no impact on climate until the 50’s, after the dust bowl ended. The cause of the dustbowl, although partly not enough water, was also caused by overgrazing and over farming, wearing out (and drying out) the soil, leaving the land with little vegetation giving way to large sandstorms. Land cultivation tripled in the 30’s, causing the plants to wither away. Then drought struck, leaving over cultivated, dry, weak soil, none of which caused by man made global warming [5]. When narrowing down to the US, our precipitation (on balance) has been increasing and droughts exhibit no trend [6].   2. Humans are the cause of Global Warming   My opponent has argued past climate changes prove CO2 is the cause, however when you look at the data there is actually no correlation between CO2 and temperature. Temperature changes regardless of CO2 levels.           Using past historical trends actually refutes my opponent’s argument. Many studies done through ice cores show co2 lags temperature, in other words temperature rises before co2 rises. Lets look at these studies:   Pearson and Palmer, 2000: They show co2 was about 3000 ppm 60 million years ago (mya) with a 0.3 oxygen isotope ratio. However, 13 million years later, the co2 dropped to 500 ppm; the oxygen isotope temperature dropped to zero (meaning a rise in temperature). Temperatures rose as CO2 drastically fell.   Pearson and Palmer 1999: 43 mya it was 5 degrees warmer Celsius, but co2 concentrations were only 385 ppm, below our current concentration today.   Pagani et al., 1999: this study found 150 mya cot concentration was only 180 ppm, but it was 6 degrees celcius warmer.   And the studies go on and on [7]. Past temperature records fail to prove global warming is caused by CO2.   Now, if warming is a natural cycle (I have shown how CO2 correlates poorly, but natural factors correlate much better) then the methane melt will happen regardless, and cannot be stopped. This is only significant if my opponent can argue global warming is driven by human emissions. And it is interesting, my opponents only data point for this I that they are melting too fast. When looking at glacier melt, worldwide there is no overall trend. For example, southern glaciers seem to be melting (Europe wise) but northern ones seem to be growing [8]. Interestignly, glaciers have been melting since 1850. And although arguably still losing mass, the amount they lose each year shrinks. According to Dowdenswel et al., 1997, “Hence, although these Arctic glaciers continue to lose mass, as they have probably done since the end of the Little Ice Age, they are losing smaller amounts each year, in the mean, which is hardly what one would expect in the face of what climate alarmists incorrectly call the 'unprecedented' warming of the latter part of the twentieth century.”[9]     3. Fixing the problem   I agree we cannot just drop fossil fuels, if we change anything I recommend it is slowly, and preferably to nuclear. My opponent, however, makes weak points and are merely asserted. He does not prove renewable will become cheaper. It would be unlikely, as stated, though. Wind, for example, has no value (unlike fossil fuels). Many good alternatives (like hydro) have been taken out of the picture due to river destruction and invasive buildings (so its not really good). Wind and Solar are inefficient, and current subsidies are costing millions merely for failed companies to fail. These green energies fail to compete with fossil fuels because of their failure to be a viable option [10].   My opponent has conceded my points to be true but argues green energy will, in the future, be viable without little proof. I would also like to note the resolution is in present tense, so unless he can prove green energies will be viable soon or beneficial now he has lost this point.   Obviously we should not brush aside these sources, but combating climate change with them at the current time, and in the near future, would be illogical. Here is my solution: nuclear power. Its not a renewable, so I am not conceding the resolution, and it is “green”. I only support it due to its efficiency and ability to compete. If we cut down regulations, this solution would work (if you are worried about CO2, and if you’re like me: it would work if you are worried about our economy).   Conclusion:   I have proven (1) CO2 is likely not the cause of global warming, (2) even if it is, global warming is not dangerous and will likely benefit mankind (see round one, too)[11], and (3) combating global warming, a natural cycle, would be frivolous, and even if it is real green energy would be illogical and non-renewables such as Nuclear should be preferred.</t>

    <t>Thank you, Con, for accepting this debate so quickly.I would like to begin my rebuttal of the three main counterarguments made in my opponent's last round. 1. Global Warming is real and a threatAs I recall, in my opening round I never proclaimed that there was global warming; merely that there is rapid changes in the Earth's climate as never before documented or noticed in geological records. There is a definite warming in specific parts of the world, [1] but there are also other areas with the same -- or even colder -- temperatures as when weather recording began in the U.S.A. in 1869. [2]Climate change is not only occurring, according to many scientific studies, but will be a threat if these trends continue. My opponent says that the temperature has not risen since 1995, and all months since have been colder on average. This statement is valid. However, the effects of our changing climate are growing each year, as showing by increases in hurricane severity in the last 60 years [3], as well as droughts that will soon rival the Dustbowl of the 1920s (which was a major factor in the Great Depression). [4]As for the possible benefits of climate change, this massive release of CO2 may, in the short term, bring benefits to organisms that undergo photosynthetic processes, but we must remember that more than carbon dioxide is released through the burning of fossil fuels. Carbon, for example, provided 33% of America's energy needs in 2011 [5]. The maximum thermodynamic efficiency of this fuel source in the common steam-turbine is only 35%. Heat is wasted, and adding more heat may increase the efficiency of combustion, but it continues to produce more waste heat and requires even more input energy, raising the output energy by a maximum of 5%. [6] To save time, I will only discuss air pollutants of coal burning. Over 20 toxic impurities are released through this process, including arsenic, lead, mercury, and fly ash. [7]2. Humans are the cause of global warming climate change*There are many ways to prove either side of this point. Geological evidence shows that there have been shifts in the Earth's mean temperature many times. The most notable being that of the Carboniferous era from 359.2 (± 2.5) m.y.a. (1*) to 299 (± .8) m.y.a. This era had an atmospheric content of 1,173 ppm (2*), which spurred plant growth unrivaled by any other era. [8,9] However, this change in carbon content took millions of years, and is actually a decrease from any previous time. During this time, the mean temperature in the Cambrian Era fell from 21 degrees centigrade to 14 degrees centigrade, which shows a correlation between carbon content and average temperature. [10]Now that I have shown the connection between atmospheric carbon and temperature, allow me to refute Con's argument. Not only is the planet being filled with more atmospheric carbon faster than ever before, but it can only continue to worsen as the ice caps laden with carbon dioxide and methane melt. [11] This additional CH4 and CO2 will increase the pace of ice melt, releasing more gas. These ice caps would naturally melt on their own terms, but not as quickly as they currently are. The rapid nature of this melt is set off by humans adding tons of gases each year to the atmosphere that trap heat, and melt the ice. Human induced climate changes also change the temperature of the air and water that flows to the poles, hindering the ability to create seasonal ice in the first place. [12]We must also remember that this post-wartime economic boom was based in industry, not in the fact that there was a sudden release of CO2. This boom was man made, in the fact that people owed us money, and we had all the goods we could need (for the time being). 3. It should be stopped--specfically with green energyAs of today, we cannot just drop all our fossil fuel consumption. It may be at least two more decades before we can have a 50-50 split between cheap renewable energy and fossil fuel combustion. In the last 10 years, however, we have made many strides forward in the efficiency. My opponent's points are accurate, but we do not currently need to rely soley on renewable energy so we do not, as consumers, need to worry about the inefficiency of the current sources. Within the next few years we will be up to par with our dream energy production, but until then the best a normal person can do to acheive this goal is push for legislation to mandate cleaner sources and support current research.To give up on these new sources now would be illogical, and prove our years of prior research to have been frivilous.In Conclusion:I have rebutted all of my opponent's points which were based on interperatable data and sources, in effect, proving that Climate Change is a threat, it is aided in growth by humans, and we can stop it with more efficient energy.

    <t>My opponent has argued that the moderate to poor correlation of CO2 is enough to be considered major, however this is illogical. First, I never said CO2 had no effect, I argued it was not the main cause. Second, it is unlikely increasing CO2 has a large impact because CO2 increases are logarithmic, in other words the more CO2 there is the less warming effect each unit has. If we double the amount of CO2 from pre-industrial levels (we have gone through 30-50% increase) then warming per I increase would be extremely small. A 20 ppm increase of CO2 would be much less then 0.2 degrees Celsius [1]. Second, the climate is not very sensitive; a better way to put it would be an increase in CO2 would have little effect. The evidence claiming climate to be sensitive are very flawed, they ignore climate feedbacks and other factors relating to sensitivity. If CO2 were to double, only a 1 degree increase would occur, we have not doubled CO2 levels from the pre-industrial era and have warmed less then one degree Celsius. With current emissions it is unlikely we could argue CO2 is the main driver of climate change, when sensitivity is taken into account [2].  Second, my opponents rebuttal to the PDO and AMO argues the correlation is due to the seas space, however he ignores the fact the PDO and AMO go into cooling cycles and the correlation I cited showed when they cooled, the earth cooled, and in a warming phase the land warmed. Dr. Roy Spencer has argued the PDO may cause three quarters of the current warming due to its effects on clouds (therefore our albedo) winds, and obviously tropical winds. And it heats the pacific, obviously warming the earth in that way too. Spencer has argued, 'mankind's CO2 emissions are not strong enough to have caused the global warming we've seen over the last 100 years.' And that 'Here I present new evidence that most of the warming could be the result of a natural cycle in cloud cover forced by a well-known mode of natural climate variability: the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). While the PDO is primarily a geographic rearrangement in atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns in the North Pacific, it is well known that such regional changes can also influence weather patterns over much larger areas, for instance North America or the entire Northern Hemisphere (which is, by the way, the region over which the vast majority of global warming has occurred).[emphasis added]'[3] For my opponents argument to work, he would need to prove the PDO and other currents would only affect the regional areas (as he argued with his map). However, the cloud cover changes caused by the PDO would change the earths albedo and cause warming for the entire northern hemisphere, and as he noted that's where the warming is primarily occurring.  1. Global warming is real and is a threat  My opponent has argued this warming is unusually fast, which is interesting, as I have argued above that warming has stopped in recent years. With the stop of warming in recent years, it is odd to argue it is rising unusually fast. Models have overestimated the effect of CO2, claiming over the last 15-20 years the warming should have increased'a lot'however the warming has stopped [4]. The earth has actually been significantly warmer throughout its time period, when comparing us to other time periods in geologic history we are in an ice age. According to the 1995 IPCC report, our warming as been extremely insignificant and fairly normal. Climate geologists, generally, oppose climate alarmism. Many of the most well known geologists have argued the current warming is 'right on schedule'. Nothing about our warming is odd, different, or one of a kind [5].  The sea level raises my opponent points too are exaggerated. There is vast evidence that sea level rise is meager to nonexistent. A 2003 study finds sea level rise has only been about .5 mm a year, half of what my opponent has argued. A 2004 study finds before 1940, sea level rise was about 1mm per year'my opponent's number'but finds there has been no sea level increase (overall) after that date. Another 2004 study found, when you averaged the whole 20th century, we get 1.8mm rise per year, but when you break it into chunks (1950-2000) no sea level rose in that time period. And yet another 2004 study finds that the sea level increase is overall uncertain. They note in their study they believe sea level has risen 2 mm per year, however they failed to control for regional variability. They said their study answers many questions and creates many more, and conclude one cannot conclude anything. A 2005 study finds no increase in sea levels since 1950. And the list continues, the evidence that sea level rise is meager is growing [6].  My opponent has admitted no increase of hurricanes was argued. In other words, even if intensity increases but the number falls, we are left with a wash. However, even the intensity argument fails. Pro argues my data is incomplete'focusing on landfall hurricanes'although that's what really matters (or at least matters more) then sea hurricanes, his argument still falls when I extend the data set. So let me again note: the number of hurricanes overall has fallen, and my opponent overall drops that point. Many studies project a 5% increase in hurricane intensity, however a 2005 study (although concluding higher intensity) says that number is twice as high as it should be. Other studies have found intensity to be the same or actually decrease. The 2005 study agreeing with my opponent, in a way, argues reducing CO2 emissions (which would occur by using green energy as the resolution states) would not change Hurricane intensity. A 2006 study finds there is no correlation between global warming and wind speeds in Hurricanes. A second 2006 study replicates the results, arguing there is no current correlation between Hurricane intensity and warming. Multiple 2007 and 2008 studies replicate these findings, arguing 'if there is an increase in hurricane activity connected to a greenhouse gas induced global warming, it is currently obscured' (Chylek, P. and Lesins 2008) and that 'no evidence that the distributional mean of individual storm intensity, measured by storm days, track length, or individual storm power dissipation index, has changed (increased or decreased) through time.' (Briggs 2008) [7]. The evidence is pretty compelling: no Hurricane intensity changes have occurred. Remember: this is using non-landfall data too (making my opponents objection refuted). And there is some evidence that global warming reduces the total number of hurricanes meaning an overall decrease of extreme weather occurs.  My opponent plays semantics. In this debate climate change, as implied in round one, is global warming. The dust bowl, as I argued, was caused by farming and not a warming earth. Therefore, his objection is irrelevant. A drought in the 16th century has been deemed a mega drought by a 2000 study. It was the largest drought in human history, before humans could have caused it. Droughts within the last 1000 years are much more severe then now, and a 1998 study noted there was a decrease of droughts in the 20th century. Warming has no correlation with droughts, however overall sun intensity (which, sometimes, means warming may correlate with droughts) and regional warming from the suns rays caused droughts, not human processes [8]. Hunnington (2006) has pointed out rainfall globally has been increasing. Many studies have concluded rainfall will increase because of global warming; plant growth will increase, decreasing the possibility of a drought [9].  2. Caused by humans  My opponent uses flawed data, my data was 60 million years ago, and my opponent has used data from the creations, 5-6 million years before. As CO2 naturally fluctuates with climate change'climate change often causes more CO2'it would not be unheard of for the ppm levels to be close too, or far from, other dates. My opponent also falsely correlated CO2 with temperature; by arguing it cannot be that close, the Cambrian was warmer. As stated, the historical correlation between CO2 and temperature is nonexistent, with CO2 lagging temperature or not correlating at all. The CO2 was 2000-3000 ppm 60 mya, by measuring oxygen isotopes. This data is impeccable, and my opponents Cambrian objection makes little sense, its not odd that CO2 was not much lower at this time period, as CO2 and temperature historically don't correlate well his Cambrian objection is a weak one [10].  My opponent really doesn't refute my lagging argument, only posts links. Those links only talk about modern temperature trends, meaning source seven stands. And when looking at data millions of years ago, it won't matter if the study was published in 1999 or 2012. But if date is what he wants, recent papers back my findings too [11].  3. Fixing the problem  The resolution is in present tense, so saying 'it will get better later' is against the wording of the resolution. However, lets refute the 'future' argument. It is impossible to replace fossil fuels with green energy, New York would need 60 square miles of wind turbines and the wind to be blowing 100% of the time to power the city. Wind power has always been more expensive then fossil fuels, and new research has still failed to fix that problem. Bio fuels and other sources are quite inefficient and waste other resources in the process. Current renewable are a joke, and billions (if not trillions) of dollars are needed to make them competitive, which is not worth the cost, especially as I argued warming may help humans and more CO2 = more plants. Green energy is not a logical solution [12]. If the Kyto agreement would not stop warming, and is only a first step, converting to green energy would likely have no effect [5]. Further, photovoltaic's are inefficient, and uncompetitive [6].  4. Extinctions  First, CO2 is not a pollutant, meaning his position is illogical here.  Second, mass extinctions are not occurring. A 2009 study notes, ''after five years, a re-visitation of the summit areas revealed a considerable increase of species richness at the upper alpine and subnival zone (10% and 9%, respectively) and relatively modest increases at the lower alpine zone and the treeline ecotone (3% and 1%, respectively).' In addition, with respect to threats of extinction, they reported that 'during the last five years, the endemic species of the research area were hardly affected,' while 'at the highest summit, one endemic species was even among the newcomers.'[14]  As we can see, animals are not being affected by warming.  CONCLUSION:  Global warming is (1) exaggerated, (2) not man made, (3) fixing it is impossible, and would not help anyone, and (4) extinctions are a widely popularized myth that has been refuted.  http://www.debate.org...</t>

    <t>Before I begin, I would like to bring up a prior statement you made from Round One: 'Correlation is always an argument in this debate...It seems hard to argue CO2 causes the warming when it fails to correlate to a degree of ‘good’ and its rivals for the title—the sun and the PDO—correlate much better then it.' (See Round one for full quote.) . I would like to point out that this is true, but the Regression Factor of CO2 would of course not be as effectual as the Irradiance of the Sun, as that is where all energy on our planet originates. The r=.44 of Carbon is not as large as the PDO and AMO (Pacific and Atlantic Decadal Oscillation), but .44 still means that there is a strong enough correlation, that it may affect our mean temperature. Of course, the .83 r factor of our currents is more effectual, since a large amount of our world’s heat is stored in our oceans as shown in the following chart: [2]  Notice that there are more high temperature areas in the oceans (mostly since the ocean is 75% of the Earth's surface area), and that they go farther North and South than the land masses do. This was meant to be included in my last round, I'm sorry for including it now.   1. Climate Change is real and is a threat   There definitely have been natural warmings of our planet, but never as fast as these last 162 years in which we have kept records of our planet's weather. In the last 7 years alone, Carbon counts globally have risen 18ppm according to various studies. [1, 3] In regards to the end of a noticeable rise in temperature being 1995, I still wholly agree. However: it is well known that just because one thing happens, the effects of it are not immediately felt. Just as how we are only now seeing light from stars that shone that light millions of years ago. The ocean's currents will not change immediately, but slowly over a few years, as will sea level. Though sea levels aren't rising worldwide, they are growing by an average rate of 3.11mm per year, an increase in the average (documented prior to 2000) of 1.63mm more per year. [4] 'However, the effects of our changing climate are growing each year, as showing by increases in hurricane severity in the last 60 years,' is a quote from my Round Two which you referenced in your rebuttal: 'Regardless...the average was 8.4 hurricanes—an overall downward trend [2].' (See Round two for full quote) I would like to point out that I never said there were more hurricanes, only that these storms were stronger than before. Again, I will cite this: [5] As for your claim that hurricane intensity has flat lined, realize that your source only documents hurricanes post-landfall. Landfall is when the eye of the hurricane is only on land, and hurricanes begin to lose force as the storm's boundaries cross the shore line, so most hurricanes are documented at a weaker strength after they have already done the majority of the damage they can. [6] Allow me to define climate: noun. 1. The composite or generally prevailing weather conditions of a region, as temperature, air pressure, humidity, precipitation, sunshine, cloudiness, and winds, throughout the year, averaged over a series of years. 2. The prevailing attitudes, standards, or environmental conditions of a group, period, or place: a climate of political unrest.  [7] According to this, the dust bowl was an effect of climate change, and my opponent even says that it was caused by humans through over-farming.   2. Humans are the cause of climate change First thing I would like to say in this section is that your source 7 is out of date, as many more have been released since then that contradict what is put forth here. [3, 8] As for Carbon ppm being 3000ppm 60mya, I must cry false, as 3000ppm is only a few thousand ppm lower than during the Cambrian era, in which the mean temperature was 7 degrees centigrade higher than today. 60mya, Carbon ppm was, at its highest peak, 1700ppm during the last years of Cretaceous era, and 500ppm only 6 million years later in the Paleocene era. [9-11] In accordance to your claim that glaciers are growing, I will argue that, saying that they grow in height, but not enough to compensate for the amount lost -- or not even gained in the first place -- each year. I can agree that these ice masses slowed their ice loss, but they resumed to lose more after your source 8 and 9 were published. [12, 13]   3. Fixing the problem   Renewable energy sources are continuing to become more efficient. Remember: it took us, as Hominids, 400,000 to achieve the level of efficiency we have today in combustion. [14, 15] To dismiss our strides in renewable energy so quickly is rash and immature as a species. Sure, wind turbines are dangerous to avian life. Hydro plants are obtrusive and change the local climate due to human interference. [16] Solar cells are expensive and large, and the output is not always sufficient. However! These innovations are from the last century, and in the next decade, we will have technologies that will far surpass what we have today as a renewable source. Even now, the photovoltaics which Con so easily dismissed are being produced and developed more than any renewable source (nuclear excluded, not renewable) with 1/100th the cost and 50% more efficiency. These are simply trial versions as well. [17] Wind kites can harness energy for the average home with no human maintenance and a 30-50-killowatt/hour range, with even more effective versions in development. [18] Biomass fuels are becoming more common [19] and soon may be one of the must substantial sources of fuel. Nuclear energy is the best we have (for now) in lieu of a completely clean renewable energy. If these energies were more substantial in countries such as China, India, Bangladesh, etc., the crisis we may be facing in the next decade can be stopped before it even starts. New Section: 4. The animal effect Concentrated atmospheric pollution kills millions of animals and gives humans living there life-threatening complications. [20] As these animals die from new diseases, pollution, and habitat loss (also climate change), we face a grim future. The complex chain of animals in our environment is so precarious, that one extinction or introduction could topple a whole ecosystem, throwing that climate in to turmoil, domino-ing the whole planet. In Conclusion! I believe that this round gives a broader view of the problem than Con is willing to propose, but cannot be neglected. </t>

    <t>I would also like to thank my opponent for this debate.   My opponent has admitted CO2 is not the chief cause in global warming, but that it has an effect. I have never denied CO2 has some effect, however I denied that it had a large one. My opponent has not negated this contention, and with it unrefuted it stands that the CO2 effect (and therefore the anthropogenic effect) is negligible, and taking a stand with green technologies would be a waste of money and effort.   My opponent has also dropped my PDO argument, conceding that the natural factors cause at least ¾ of the current warming. This only leaves ¼ of the current warming for any man-made forcing, and as stated the sun correlates better with climate. Accepting the fact that sun spot length correlates extremely well with climate, and other forgings such as cosmic rays and our position in the galaxy hint we should be warming, it leaves a small percentage of the current warming for man-made causes [1].   With this in mind, and global warming mainly a natural cycle, my opponent has failed to meet the BOP and prove global warming is man made and should be stopped.   1. Global warming is real and is a threat   My opponent has admitted that global warming does not exist. To be honest, I am confused by this statement. Is my opponent assuming global warming has stopped, or that it is mainly in the northern hemisphere? Regardless, it seems as though he has conceded that a global phenomena of global warming exists. I only partially agree. There was global warming in the 20th century, but the rate of warming has slowed and no warming has occurred since 1995 [1]. My opponent then continues saying he thinks warming will continue. This seems like a contradiction from his first point here. No matter, he has conceded multiple times the warming has stopped. So it seems illogical that it will keep increasing if it has already backtracked.   My opponent finished by saying our data is biased. Yes, it is. The question, however, is whose bias is correct. I have given, in my opinion, a more compelling case that my bias is correct and my side on the correct side of history. Therefore, biased data is irrelevant, but whose bias is correct is relevant. And I hope the voters, and others reading, can see my bias is correct.   My opponent has also dropped (and therefore conceded) that global warming does not cause hurricanes. I have provided many peer reviewed studies denying this effect, proving global warming is not a threat.   My opponent has also conceded my point that global warming helps the human race (see round 1 and two). So even if warming is man-made (it is not) then why should we stop a beneficial force?     2. Global warming is anthropogenic    My opponent starts with a NASA favorite: records breaking CO2 levels. However, when you look at the ice record, CO2 levels are at an all time low [1]. Interestingly, if we move the data back in time we see CO2 was breaking record in 1750 with 284 ppm, before human emissions where significant. From 1750 – 1875, CO2 rose 10 times faster ten anthropogenic CO2 emissions. It took humans 100 years to catch up with CO2 emissions (new emissions, not the total. We are less then 5% of the CO2 emissions in the atmosphere). The CO2 growth rate, although fast, is not “out of control” [2].   I would like to reiterate my sensitivity argument. Doubling CO2 would only increase temperatures by one degree Celsius. We have warmed .6 degrees Celsius (less using satellite data). We have only increased co2 35%. Therefore, CO2 likely had little effect on the current warming.   Now to my opponents data:   -- The first data set was irrelevant, it was before the date --The other data was far before the respected time period --Only your last data applied   The last data Wikipedia cherry picked as I stated Pearson 2000 documented the carbon ppm 60 million years ago. It said ppm was actually 500 ppm, we agree, but “the oxygen isotope ratio has dropped (implying a rise in temperature) to zero, which is, of course, just the opposite of what one would expect from the 'large and predictable effect' of CO2 on temperature that is commonly assumed.” Meaning carbon dropped but temperature rose. And the drop was substantial, showing co2 is not a strong climate driver [4]. My argument was that the spike near that time increased ppm to 3000, while temperature fell. The argument has been misinterpreted. We actually agree on the carbon count, but my opponent misses the point that there is no correlation between carbon and temperature.  I tried to post this in round one; it didn't work. It is the same point (so I am not bringing up anything new here), it merely makes it visual.   CO2 and Global Temp.? No correlation! And my opponent only speculates on the age of my data. If you read the source (round two, source 7) you see they used ice core data and tree ring proxies, still used in the climate debate and is a widely accepted proxy today.   3. Fighting the problem    “We are not ready to drop non-renewable fossil fuels. The profit is greater, and the amount of energy produced from these fuels far exceeds renewable energy. Hopefully, that can change. If not for a hopefully cleaner planet, then simply for the fact that we are going to run out one day. However, we will continue to grow in our ability to produce cheaper sustainable energy.” – My opponent My opponent invests his whole argument in faith that it will improve. Although passive solar houses might be a good idea (for those off the grid), my opponents point will always fail: the sun isn’t always shining, the wind not always flowing, the water not always flowing, but the pumps will keep on drilling and the nuclear plants will keep on burning. Fossil fuels should last 200 years, nuclear another 100. These estimates keep growing because we keep discovering new oil every day, not to mention some sea exploration would likely add the oil count by hundreds of years. We really don’t seem to be running out of oil because we keep finding more. Either way, green energy is not a constant or reliable energy source. Fossil fuels and nuclear power is. Take that how you wish; facts vs the faith of my opponent.   Conclusion: --Global warming is not man-made, stopping it would be pointless --Global warming is not harmful, and it is beneficial, why should we stop a good force? --Green energy is impractical --My opponent dropped (and therefore concedes as the truth) the: PDO, warming stopped, extinctions are not happening, the harm of global warming, droughts, and the fact that sea levels are not rising   Reading the debate (I hope) and my conclusion, I believe the voters should see it logical to vote for CON.     1.

    <t>I would like to thank 16kadams for a wonderful first debate, here at DDO.I also must admit that my opponent has put forth very valid arguments, some of which I greatly agree with. I hope that in the future -- when I am a more developed debater -- I may challenge him again.As for my correlation of CO2 to warming, I must stand strong with it. I am aware that it was not the largest factor, but this correlation rate will continue to drop as the ppm of Carbon Dioxide rises, as it is an inverse equality. This is not me conceding the fact that there is a correlation, but that as our world becomes more laden with CO2, each molecule will have less and less of an effect. 1. Global Warming is real and is a threatI do not believe in Global Warming, as it means to show that the whole planet is warming (which I do not believe), but I understand the general use of the term now, even in ways to describe climate change. I believe that there is a vast change in our climate, and will continue to be as such. Perhaps now our data is biased on both sides, pro- or con-climate change.2. Caused by humansI am well aware of the natural cycles of warming in Earth's geological history. Never before have we experienced such a sharp upward clime of Carbonppm without a natural calamity (such as eruptions, meteor collisions, etc.). To refute Con's claims on the 2,000-3,000ppm pf Carbon 60mya, I will use the same data as in my round 3. I used data from 66mya, 60mya, and 58mya, just to make sure I had all my bases covered, in case of his 60mya figure being an estimate.My attempted refute on your round2 source 7 was based on the grounds that our methods of measuring have become more efficient and accurate, so the data could be deemed inaccurate today (only a speculation).3.

    <t>Introduction:The problem I and many others have with the Cato Institute is the fact that it allows special interest groups (individuals, corporations and foundations) who fund it to hijack its message, even when that message is controversial. I will show three prominent examples of this, and then say why this matters to Cato's credibility.Argument #1Cato was a large proponent of the Big Tobacco industry, accepting large donations from Big Tobacco and in turn jumping on the Big Tobacco bandwagon.Proof that Cato recieves funding from Big Tobacco: Source: Americans for Nonsmoker's Rights, August 2004.'1. The Cato Institute received a $10,000 “philanthropic contribution” from Philip Morris in 1991.2. Between 1995 and 1998 alone, Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds jointly contributed at least $425,000 to the Cato Institute. One Philip Morris document budgets a $175,000 “policy payment” for the Cato Institute to focus on “Individual Liberties” and “Regulatory Issues”.3. The Wall Street Journal quoted Cato analyst Jerry Taylor as stating that the Cato Institute received over $100,000 from tobacco giant Philip Morris and $50,000 from RJ Reynolds in 1995 alone.4. According to a memo prepared and drafted by the law firm Covington and Burling for Philip Morris, entitled “1995 Tort Reform Program,” $600,000 was allocated for “National Think Tanks/Retained Consultants (e.g. Citizens for a Sound Economy, Cato Institute, Manhattan Institute, Hudson Institute)” to reduce the potential legal liability of corporations, including tobacco companies, for wrongfully harming their customers.5. Media mogul Rupert Murdoch sat on the Board of Directors at Philip Morris and the Cato Institute. Murdoch’s News Corporation owns numerous broadcasting and print media corporations, including Fox Broadcasting. News Corporation voted Philip Morris CEO Geoffrey Bible onto its board in 1998.'So know we know that Cato got the funding. How did they pay Big Tobacco back? Source: (1-4: Same as above) (4-6): National Review (4/20/12)'1. The Cato Institute has challenged credible science that links secondhand smoke exposure to death and disease and has organized opposition to smoke-free environments.2. An article in the San Francisco Chronicle, based on a report published by Public Citizen, stated that the Cato Institute was one of seven conservative think tanks that received at least $3.5 million between 1992 to 1995 from the drug and tobacco industries to “curb the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory powers.” Of the $3.5 million, Cato reportedly received at least $152,500 to counter the FDA’s regulatory process. According to the article:The think tanks have used the money to produce a “steady stream of reports, fact sheets, op-ed articles and newspapers, radio and television advertisements purporting to document the FDA’s deadly overcaution and bullying of manufacturers.”3. A 1995 Philip Morris document cites the Cato Institute as one of its “messengers” for relaying the tobacco company’s opposition to the FDA.4. In July 2000, the Cato Institute co-filed a brief with the National Smokers Alliance in the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit alleging that the Master Settlement Agreement violated U.S. antitrust law.Philip Morris listed Cato VP David Boaz as one of its “National Allies in a 2000 memo.5. Cato chairman Robert Levy, who today accuses the Kochs of turning Cato into “a mouthpiece of special interests,” once faithfully served the tobacco industry as a leading tobacco-death denialist. In his article, “Lies, Damn Lies amp; 400,000 Smoking-Related Deaths”, Levy claimed, “children do not die of tobacco-related diseases” and “there is no credible evidence that 400,000 deaths per year—or any number remotely close to 400,000—are caused by tobacco.” (In fact, tobacco use kills more than 5 million people a year worldwide.)6. In 2001, a British-American Tobacco executive sent a thank-you letter to Levy and the Cato Institute, noting: “I was also pleased to learn after our meeting that our subsidiary company, Brown amp; Williamson, provided the Cato Institute with funding in 2000.”Argument #2Cato and many of it's scholars are outspoken climate change skeptics, and really take it to the next level.Cato's actions on climate change/global warming: Source: (1-5: Greenpeace) (6: Wikipedia page on the Cato Institute)'1. Cato is a member of the State Policy Network, a network of state level think tanks and policy organizations that act as a coordinated front for a variety of corporate priorities including delaying action to mitigate global warming. The State Policy Network has promoted climate science denial conferences hosted by the Heartland Institute and circulated unscientific reports from Heartland's 'Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change.' Heartland's 'Climate Change Reconsidered' reports are authored by career climate deniers such as S. Fred Singer and Craig Idso.2. The organization's 2009 'Handbook for Policymakers' on global warming begins with the suggestions that Congress should 'pass no legislation restricting emissions of carbon dioxide' and 'inform the public about how little climate change would be prevented by proposed legislation.'3. Robert Bradley, an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute, is also a founder and the CEO of the Institute for Energy Research.4. In 2007 the Cato Foundation gave $120,000 to New Hope Environmental Services, an 'advocacy science consulting firm' founded and run by long-time climate science denier Patrick Michaels, who uses New Hope to publish his World Climate Report, a sort of ongoing journal of denial of climate science. Michaels is also a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, which paid him $98,000 to write a book, The Satanic Gases, with fellow skeptic Robert Balling. Over the years, Michaels' work has been financed by a number of coal and polluter interests, including the Western Fuels Association, the Intermountain Rural Electric Association, and others.5. In 2012, the Koch brothers sued the Cato Institute in order to exert more control over the organization. The lawsuit was dropped after an agreement was reached between the two parties, following months of highly-publicized attacks back and forth. David Koch remains on Cato's board of directors.6. Three out of five 'Doubters of Global Warming' interviewed by PBS's Frontline were funded by, or had some other institutional connection with, the Institute. Cato has often criticized Al Gore's stances on the issue of global warming and agreed with the Bush administratons's skeptical attitude toward the Kyoto protocols.Rationale for these actions: Source: (1: Greenpeace article above) (2, 3: Wikipedia page on Cato) (4: Sierra Club Magazine)'1. $1,285,750 received from Koch foundations 2005-2010 [Total Koch foundation grants 1997-2010: $5,535,750]2. Charles G. Koch cofounded Cato, was chairman of the board, was a shareholder along with David Koch, his brother, who are both anthropogenic climate change skeptics.3. David Koch is a member of Cato's board, and Kevin Gentry, employee and top aide to the Koch's also serves on the board.4. Charles and David Koch own Koch Industries. 'For Koch Industries, the amounts of money it can save by sabotaging environmental rules make the sums diverted to the think tanks that do the dirty work pale in comparison. The year 2000 was particularly rough for the Kochs. In January, Koch Industries agreed to pay about $35 million for violations of the Clean Water Act related to 310 oil spills in six states. Two months later, Koch admitted to environmental violations at its oil refinery in Rosemount, Minnesota, and was forced to cough up another $8 million in penalties. Then in July, it agreed not only to spend about $80 million to cut emissions from its Rosemount facility and from two other refineries in Texas, but also to pay a $1 million fine for air-pollution violations.'More examples to follow, but for now, out of characters.</t>

    <t>'C1: Cato and Big Tobacco'1) I may have been a touch misleading here, and I apologize for any confusion I may have caused. I am not arguing that the Institute is tailoring it's content to match it's donors interests in the way you just described, which, unfortunately, is difficult to prove without further evidence. I am not arguing that Cato exclusively accepted Big Tobacco funding to coincide with its anti-smoking efforts; I am arguing that the reason the Cato Institute exists is primarily to produce academic and legislative proposals that coincide with the interests of large corporations (note that they exist solely to make an economic profit) make those policies mainstream, and push them through Congress. What I am accusing Cato of is corporatism, and hijacking legislative policy to serve the interests of corporations, not citizens, not the public, not the world. It is no surprise ExxonMobil, Koch Industries, ChevronTexaco, Tenneco Gas, the American Petroleum Institute, the Amoco Foundation, the Claude R. Lamb Charitable foundation, the Charles G. Koch foundation, the Philip Anschutz foundation and the Atlantic Richfield Organization all fund the Cato Institute, to name the ties it has with the petroleum industry, but Cato also recieves funding from Big Pharma (Eli Lilly amp; Company, Merck amp; Company and Pfizer, Inc.) Big Finance (Citibank, Prudential, Chase Manhattan, American Express, Salomon Brothers) and Big Tech (Verizon, Microsoft, Sun Microsystems, Verisign, Netscape, BellSouth). It was from its start as you correctly described in line with general libertarianism and the belief in individual liberties that put it against a smoking ban, the FDA, etc. The reason you and I should take note of this is because while Cato claims to be nonpartisan and independent, those are selective definitions of the real meaning behind the words. Cato is a bastion of policies that coincide with the philosophy of the largest multinational conglomerates. We later discovered smoking was a problem, along with secondhand smoking, and it was banned and regulated. This of course was a loss for the corporations and Cato. If people knew who was behind Cato, they would be more skeptical of its policy proposals, just as many people are today of corporation's proposals, and for good reason.2) I suggest you read 'Lies, Damned Lies, and 400,000 Smoking related deaths,' (www.cato.org/pubs/regulation/regv21n4/lies.pdf) written by Robert A. Levy, chairman of Cato's board of directors, and senior fellow emeritus of constitutional studies, which ironically has little to do with science, especially medical science.This article was later refuted by the American Council of Science and Health, whose two authors, Alicia M. Lukachko, and Elizabeth M. Whelan, who each have a Masters degree in Public health, and a Doctor of Science. Read an excerpt from their critique: 'In the Fall 1998 issue of Regulation (“The Cato Review of Business and Government”), the Cato Institute published an article by Robert Levy and Rosalind Marimont titled “Lies, Damned Lies, amp; 400,000 Smoking-Related Deaths.” In their article, Levy and Marimont contend that the U.S. government’s estimate of approximately 400,000 annual premature deaths due to cigarette smoking is scientifically unsound and substantially inflated. The authors assert that “the war on smoking . . . has grown into a monster of deceit and greed, eroding the credibility of government and subverting the rule of law.” In this report, scientists at the American Council on Science and Health refute Levy and Marimont’s key arguments (presented below) as unscientific and inflammatory. ACSH’s critique concludes that the estimate of 400,000 annual deaths due to cigarette smoking is indeed reliable and may even be an underestimate.The authors make four primary assertions leading to their conclusion that the figure of 400,000 is inflated. Those four assertions and a summary of ACSH’s critique of each of them follow.' Read the full critique here: 'http://www.acsh.org... response to my second claim, public places is what I am referring to. Read 'http://www.cato.org...; Note the title: Smoking bans are dangerous to free soceity's health. And there's more where that came from. Read “the case against smoking bans” 'www.cato.org/pubs/regulation/regv29n4/v29n4-4.pdf'3)-Refer to above, where I underline why opposition to regulation not from the standpoint of society but instead corporate interests has a negative effect on society and is undeserving of respect.1) First, Pro's only claim is that Cato holds to a certain position without actually even attempting to show why it should discredit Cato...'Umm... Because you have business interests tied to that, and other issues, which you have surreptitiously accepted funding to reaffirm your position. For example, read this headline: 'http://www.guardian.co.uk...; 'Patrick Michaels, fellow at the Cato Institute, claimed 3% of his funding came from industry, later revealed that figure to be 40%.'2) Oxford Handbook on Climate Change: 'The earlier-mentioned conservative resurgence began when wealthy conservative philanthropists such as Joseph Coors began to fund, typically through their family foundations, the establishment of conservative think tanks (CTTs) such as the Heritage Foundation towage a ‘war of ideas’ against the progressive gains of the 1960s (Himmelstein 1990; Lapham 2004). By the 1990s conservative foundations were funding a ‘conservative labyrinth' designed to implant conservative values and goals in academic, media,governmental,legal, and religious institutions (Covington 1997: 3). Particularly important is the network of well-heeled and inﬂuential think tanks that churn out an endless ﬂow of policy proposals credited with moving the US policy agenda signiﬁcantly to the right (Krehely et al. 2004) and—since the 1990s—influencing climate policy (McCright and Dunlap 2003, 2010). Major funders include foundations controlled by Richard Mellon Scaife and David and Charles Koch (both drawing upon family fortunes stemming in part from oil interests). Besides giving generously to a vast range of CTTs and conservative causes, they are responsible for establishing the Cato Institute (C. Koch), Citizens for a Sound Economy, now Americans for Prosperity (D. Koch) and Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow or CFACT (R. M. Scaife)—three particularly crucial elements of the denial machine. ln fact, in recent years the Scaife and Koch families of funds may have exceeded ExxonMobil in terms of funding climate change denial actors and activities (Grandia 2009; Greenpeace 2010b; Mashey 2010). CTT‘s represent social movement organizations that typically serve as spokespersons and facilitators for conservative causes (Jacques et al. 2008; McCright and Dunlap 2000). While corporations like ExxonMobil have joined conservative foundations in providing generous funding for CTTs, many of the latter appear to oppose climate science and policy making for purely ideological reasons (McCright and Dunlap 2010: 109-11). CTT's are a fundamental and highly efective component of the denial machine, providing institutional bases for leading contrarians such as Patrick Michaels (a Cato Fellow), hosting anti-IPCC conferences (Heartland Institute), sponsoring ‘educational events‘ for politicians (National Center for Policy Analysis), assisting the George W. Bush Administration’s efforts to impede climate policy (Competitive Enterprise Institute), and producing and circulating a vast range of anti-climate change material via various forms of media (reports, press releases, press conferences, videos, radio and television interviews). among other activities (see e.g. Hoggan with Littlemore 2009; Lahsen 2008; McCright and Dunlap 2000, 2003; Oreskes and Conway 2010).</t>

    <t>C1: Cato and Big TobaccoPro's first claim is that Cato has received donations from 'Big Tobacco' and in return Pro alleges that the Institute tailored its content to reflect the interests of its donors. 1) The first problem with this assumption is that it fails to establish that Cato's content was substantially effected by the donations in question. He says that Cato accepted Big Tobacco donations ' and in turn jumping on the Big Tobacco bandwagon.' The earliest instance Pro cites of donations to Cato from 'Big Tobacco' like donors was in 1991. However, Cato from its inception (in 1974, 17 years before the first donation in question) has been an opponent of government action to curb non-aggressive individual activities. Things like smoking bans and corporate regulation are something Cato has always been opposed to, which would naturally put them somewhat in line with the interest of tobacco corporations. Pro needs to establish that Cato's content was posterior to the various donations and has failed to do so thus far.2) On Pro's examples, he fails to show that the content must be biased. For instance, Pro says Cato 'has challenged credible science that links second hand smoke exposure to death and disease and has organized opposition to smoke-free environments.' On the first claim, Pro doesn't offer any substantive evidence to back the claim up. On the second claim, opposing 'smoke-free environments' is incredibly vague. Is he referring to private residences and properties or is he referring to public places? The former is basic private propertarian ideology, something Cato supported before the 90's. The latter also needs backing up by Pro since he also failed to provide evidence supporting it.3) Pro's claim attempting to link the Cato Institute's opposition to the FDA is also misleading. Since the FDA's main function is to regulate the output of private industry and Cato from its inception has been a predominantly free market thing tank, it's natural that Cato would be opposed to it. Therefore Pro simply saying Cato has spent money writing against the FDA fails to prove anything.C2: Cato and Climate Change1) First, Pro's only claim is that Cato holds to a certain position without actually even attempting to show why it should discredit Cato. Let's go out on a limb and say Cato (as a monolithic entity I suppose) wholesale denies climate change (not just certain aspects or the prospect of government intervention). Why should this wholly discredit the organization? Cato isn't just a scientific institution. It also deals with topics dealing with a large range of policy issues. Let's say Cato is wrong on climate change. That still doesn't fulfill the rather large burden of proof Pro has assumed in attempting to discredit the entire organization.2) Pro has also been incredibly ambiguous on Cato's actual policy in regards to global climate change. He alludes several times to Cato's opposition to various State actions attempting to mitigate climate change but never actually mentions across the board beliefs of Cato scholars and writers. Of course I should repeat that Pro hasn't shown why denying certain aspects of global climate change should necessitate denying credibility to the institute.</t>

    <t>The Cato Institute (www.cato.org) is a influential American think tank, headquartered in Washington D.C. According to the 2011 Global Go To Think Tank Index, Cato is the 6th most influential US based think tank, ranking 3rd in Economic Policy and 2nd in Social Policy. It was founded in 1974 by Murray Rothbard, Ed Crane, and Charles Koch. In this debate I will argue against the widespread respect it garners from the academic and policy communities and instead portray it as a bastion of simple propaganda and special interests.</t>

    <t>C1: Cato and Big Tobacco  1) Pro has changed his main argument from the thesis that Cato tailors it's content as a result of corporate donations to the thesis that the reason Cato exists originally is in order to forward corporate interests. An interesting idea I suppose but Pro offers no substantiation. Pro just says Cato is backed by corporations. But his new thesis (brought in the last round) requires evidence surrounding the genesis of Cato, not with current affairs so just saying that Cato has received corporate donations is insuficient to show that the basis of its inception was to forward corporate interests. This requires Pro to offer evidence concerning the motivations of Cato's founders, something Pro hasn't even attempted to do.  Pro also fails to offer a rebuttal to my point that the policy proposals of right-wing libertarianism would in some instances naturally coincide with those of corporations, meaning the argument fails to prove that Cato's policy proposals are a result of corporate donations as opposed to the ideological bent of the organization. Pro responds by saying that Cato claims to be an independent organization which he claims is false. But why does he say this? Because their interests naturally coincide at some points with corporations. Even so this doesn't prove that Cato isn't independent since Pro hasn't established a causal link from the interests of corporations to the content of Cato. Otherwise it's just a natural coincidence of interests.  2) Pro still hasn't shown why Cato's claims are biased or false. He's just shown that there is opposition. However, even if he shows Cato to be wrong, this doesn't prove corporate-backed bias. Pro also elucidated on his smoking bans point in saying he was referring to public-place smoking bans. Of course, Pro still fails to offer substantiation on why this is (a) wrong, (b) necessarily a result of corporate interests, or (c) why even if it is wrong, why it warrants withdrawing credibility from an entire organization.  3) Pro still hasn't shown why opposition to the FDA or other regulator institutions must be the result of corporate influence and cannot be explained by the ideological bent of the organization since its genesis. See a more full refutation in Point 1 of C1.  C2: Cato and Climate Change  1) Pro fails to adequately respond to my point. Basically, Pro is saying that Cato scholars have a different opinion on climate change than him. Therefore they are undeserving of respect. Pro makes this claim without actually establishing why that should be the case. Now instead of backing up his claim in respect to the actual content of Cato's global climate change proposals, Pro is simply saying Cato makes its claims because of corporate donation. For full refutation of this see Point 1 of C1 above. Just because some third party has the same interests as X, doesn't mean X's actions must be the result of that third party. This is especially so in that Cato's ideological bent has been right wing libertarianism since its inception.  2) Pro's rebuttal here isn't actually a rebuttal at all. It's just more claims that conservative think tanks are generally biased. In failing to rebut my counter, Pro drops some important points. For instance, Pro hasn't shown which beliefs of Cato scholars are wrong or why if they are wrong, why that should destroy the credibility of an entire organization. Cato is a policy institute. Just saying that their policy proposals are wrong in one area doesn't show why wholesale loss of credibility is warranted. Of course Pro never attempted to show that their beliefs were wrong in this area so the point is moot I suppose.</t>

    <t>What is a greenhouse gas? Wikipedia says:  A greenhouse gas is a gas in an atmosphere that absorbs and emits radiation within the thermal infrared range. This process is the fundamental cause of the greenhouse effect. The primary greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere are water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. [1]  1. CO2 is increasing.  The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in Earth's atmosphere has reached 395 ppm (parts per million) as of June 2012 and rose by 2.0 ppm/yr during 2000'2009. This current concentration is substantially higher than the 280 ppm concentration present before industrial times, with the increase largely attributed to anthropogenic sources. [2] The burning of fossil fuels has caused CO2 levels in the atmosphere to rise from 280 ppm to 397 ppm. [1]  2. Methane is increasing, too.  In 2010, methane levels in the Arctic was at 1850 nmol/mol, which is over twice as high as at any time in the 400,000 years before the industrial revolution. The Earth's atmospheric methane concentration has increased by about 150% since 1750, and it accounts for 20% of the total radiative forcing from all of the long-lived and globally mixed greenhouse gases (Excluding water vapour). [3]  3. Did the temperature rise? Statics say yes. The graph at [4] shows that it has risen by roughly 0.6 Degrees C. </t>

EDIT: Per Ron-Paul's request, the resolution is changed and the voting period is now 1 month.  My Starting Arguments:  Yes, the Earth is warming. Since the early 20th century, Earth's mean surface temperature has increased by about 0.8 'C (1.4 'F), with about two-thirds of the increase occurring since 1980.[1]  Is it caused mainly by humans? Humans have increased the amount of Co2, a greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases increase the Earth's temperature.  'Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the burning of fossil fuels has contributed to the increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from 280 ppm to 397 ppm, despite the uptake of a large portion of the emissions through various natural 'sinks' involved in the carbon cycle.'[2]  Plus, global warming could cause ice cap melting. Dan Miller said that the ice caps can be gone by 2020. </t>

    <t>I would like to thank jh1234l for this great debate. CO2 CorrelationFirst, what my opponent seems to fail to take into account, is that the Earth is in the middle of a 30-year cooling trend.  'Because PDO cycles last 25 to 30 years, Easterbrook expects the cooling trend to continue for another 2 decades or so.  Easterbrook, in fact, documents 40 such alternating periods of warming and cooling over the past 500 years, with similar data going back 15,000 years.  He further expects the flipping of the ADO to add to the current downward trend.'[1]Then why was 2010 the hottest year ever?'The 'hottest year' claims confirm the case for political science overtaking climate science. The “hottest year” claim depends on minute fractions of a degree difference between years. Even NASA's James Hansen, the leading proponent of man-made global warming in the U.S., conceded the 'hottest year' rankings are essentially meaningless. Hansen explained that 2010 differed from 2005 by less than 2 hundredths of a degree F (that's 0.018F).'[2]'There has now been no net warming since 1997 -15 years with CO2 rising with no global temperature increase. Since 2003, the trend is negative.'[3]And a graph:  [4]Second, my opponent provides this way out of whack graph, even though I have posted many graphs accurately showing the correlation between solar activity and temperature. I'm not to be mean and provide a new argument, so I will simply leave the audience with something to consider: Remember the laws of thermodynamics. Even if the sun's activity has leveled off, there will still be increases in temperature for a short while because the sun is still producing more energy. Sun      For my opponent's first point, I would like to thank him for conceding that the sun's activity is decreasing also, further supporting the conclusion that the Earth is cooling, which I mentioned above. Also, this further disproves the idea of CO2 causing global warming becuase CO2 concentrations are continuing to go up exponentially. (Also, I realize this might be in contradiction with my earlier point, but I encourage readers to look at overall levels, and the fact that the MWP was longer than this time's warming). As for my opponent's second point, he hasn't proven anything wrong because your graph doesn't show correlation at all. In addition, he drops ALL the other stellar data I provided in the last round.     Cosmic Rays My opponent has provided no rebuttal to my cosmic ray point; all he has done is make another claim about CO2's causation of the current warming. I will simply provide a short rebuttal and a graph.     [5]There is clearly not that much correlation, especially today when temperatures are decreasing.Now on to a research paper on the topic:The highlights of the paper are:  ► Changes in global atmospheric CO2 are lagging about 11–12 months behind changes in global sea surface temperature, 9.5-10 months behind changes in global air surface temperature, and 9 months behind changes in global lower troposphere temperature. ► Changes in ocean temperatures appear to explain a substantial part of the observed changes in atmospheric CO2 since January 1980. ► CO2 released from use of fossil fuels have little influence on the observed changes in the amount of atmospheric CO2, and changes in atmospheric CO2 are not tracking changes in human emissions.[6]Once more, my opponent has failed to respond to my arguments on cosmic rays.   PDO/AMO  My opponent is claiming that I have not provided a '10 year correlation record of PDO/AMO', although I'm sure I have in the numerous graphs and quotes I've made on this topic.I'll provide another graph:[7]As we can see, there is extremely large correlation, and that the sun spot number and climate is extremely correlated. And when broken into the last century, has a stronger correlation then CO2. PDO is also considered a large factor in the current warming, and its statistical correlation is extremely high and should never be considered unworthy as a component in warming [8].The facts where presented, the current correlation since 1880 was not strong enough to mean CO2 was a large factor, as it was under a .5 R correlation. The PDO (a natural forcing) had higher correlations by factors of two. Position in Galaxy  I would like to thank my opponent for presenting the whole quote, but it does not help his case one bit. My opponent can obviously not see that this was a point agreed upon by the creators of that article. Notice that 'militants' say, not ISIL. What ISIL says is: 'To put it another way, the amount of CO2 in our atmosphere is the result of changes in solar activity, not the cause of it. Climate change is natural, continuous, and caused by changes in solar emissions.'[9]Obviously, my opponent misread my quote. Now I will post the very last thing on cosmic rays: The following table sets out a comparison of the predictions of two climate theories - the CO2 warming theory and the Sun/Cosmic Ray theory - and actual real world data.

In other words, very reliable. I also provided ice core and tree ring data which are also very reliable. These are certainly worthy statistics and my opponent has dropped them. The Sun     I already countered all of this earlier.  Also, 'Temperatures have been increasing since 1980 faster than can be explained by the sunspot cycle length, indicating a possible human CO2 contribution. The recent increase of the cycle lengths explains why there has been no warming since 2002. Temperature changes are expected to follow Sun activity changes due to a time lag resulting from the large heat capacity of the oceans.'[10]Conclusion   'Just how much of the 'Greenhouse Effect' is caused by human activity?    It is about 0.28%. [11] Thanks again to my opponent for the debate. </t>

    <t>I would like to thank jh12341 for presenting his arguments. My opponent posts a very convincing graph to his argument, until you look at it closer, you find that there is about a 1000-year lag that shows CO2 pratically a millenium behind temperature. '...the CO2 changes have lagged about 800 years behind the temperuatre changes. Global warming has produced more CO2, rather than more CO2 producing global warming.'[1] My opponent uses an extremely zoomed out graph, making it hard to see this. However, I will make it easier for everyone and show the last 11000 years of CO2 history:[2]'In fact, the air's CO2 content did not begin to rise until 400 to 1,000 years after the planet began to warm. Ice cores provide a detailed record of local temperature and CO2 concentrations. A study finds that the CO2 increase lagged Antarctic deglacial warming by 800 +/- 200 years. CO2 does not seem to be following that well.'[3]Then, my opponent claims that there has been warming from 1940-1970. However, two simple things will counter this. One, 'In spite of rhetoric to the contrary, the majority of this warming took place naturally before 1940. This warming trend was interrupted by a 35-year cooling period from 1940 to 1975.'[4] And a graph:  [5]As can be easily seen from the graph, there was a 0.2 C degree drop in global temperature anomalies from 1942 till 1977.     The Rest of the Solar System  I can happily post more evidence of this.Here are some solar system wide effects:  Sun - 'Recent Activity Highest in 8000 Years [meaning it's not just the 11-year cycle] and'magnetic field has decreased in size by 25% 300% increase in galactic dust entering solar system Mercury - magnetosphere experiencing significant increases Venus  - 2500% Increase in Green Glow Mars - Rapid Appearance of Clouds, Ozone and'Up to 50% Erosion of Ice Features in one year alone Jupiter - Plasma Torus increasing and'Jupiter's Disappearance of White Ovals since 1997 ' recent increase in storms Io - 'observing same changes -' 200% Increase in Density of Plasma Torus and Ionosphere 1000% Higher Europa - Much Brighter Than Expected Ganymede - 200% brighter Saturn's - Plasma Torus 1000% Denser and'Aurora First Seen in polar regions in recent years Uranus - featureless in 1996, now exhibiting huge storms since 1999 and markedly brighter in 2004 than in 1999 Neptune - 40% Brighter, Near Infrared Range ' 1996 ' 2002 Triton - Severe atmospheric changes, warming Pluto - 300% increase in atmospheric pressure.  You can't be telling me all of this is a coincidence. Also, by the way, since CO2 does not correlate with temperatures, your Pluto-to-Earth claim is fallacious.'[6] So, there are also many other bodies being affected.  Earthly Causes  For my cosmic ray quote, you have to understand that there are many factors affecting the Earth's climate: ocean currents, climatic cycles, etc... However, it is easy to spot the correlation, isn't it?[3]There is a very good fit. Cosmic rays inversly correlate with temperature. In addition to this,   [7]Cosmic rays inversly correlate with sunspots and low clouds (which both produce warming).Low clouds means warmer temperatures: 'Cloud cover has decreased over the past 39 years globally, and temperatures have risen during that time. This global decrease in cloud cover alone could account for all surface warming observed since the 1970s.'[8]Putting this all together, 'For example, the authors of a paper by NASA's JPL remark '...has compared the minimum aa [index of geomagnetic activity] values with the Earth's surface temperature record and found a correlation of 0.95 between the two data sets starting in 1885. The solar irradiance [solar activity] proxy developed from the aa minima continues to track the Earth's surface temperature until the present.''[9]There. Cosmic rays, the sun, and all the Earth's natural cycles have a .95 correlation.  For my PDO/AMO quote, I'm not sure what my opponent is trying to say and ask him to clarify.The Position In Galaxy and Cosmic RaysFirst, my opponent could have posted the entire quote. He only used ~3500 characters for his whole R3 argument with a 8000 character limit. Please post the whole thing and I will evaluate it in R5.Second, my opponent misinterprets my graph. I said earlier that the top chart was, 'The lower panel shows the match achieved by removing El Nino, the North Atlantic Oscillation, volcanic aerosols and a linear trend of 0.14 Celsius/decade.' The bottom chart is the more useful (and more accurate) way to isolate cosmic rays, and lo and behold, there is a correlation for that time.As if I haven't posted enough to convince you of cosmic ray's effect on temperature, I will post one more graph:    [10]Finally, I already refuted my opponent's last point. Medieval Warm Period  There is ample evidence that the Medieval Warm Period and Holocene Climate Maximum were hotter than today:'Chinese temperatures were 2 to 3 degrees C higher than present during China's climate optimum.''...during the Medieval Warming... . Temperatures may have been as much as 2.5 degrees C warmer [than today] due to a southward shift of the climate belts.''...the central Argentinean area had more precipitation during the Medieval Warming than today. Temperatures may have been as much as 2.5 degrees C warmer due to a southward shift of the tropical rainbelts.''The largest anomaly was a rapid warming-4 degrees C-between 350 B.C and A.D 450, reflecting a warmer climate in equatorial East Africa.''On Signy Island, halfway between Antarctica and the southern tip of South America, there clearly shows the Roman Warming..., the Dark Ages [cooling]..., the Medieval Warming, the Little Ice Age, and the 20th century warming-which is cooler to date than the Medieval Warming.'[1]I will keep coming with more. There is a clear correlation.'Indirect evidence suggests that the average temperature was as much as 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer [during the Medieval Warm Period] than today.'[11]Also, a graph:[12]Clearly, there were many times warmer than today.The Sun   First, solar activity is still increasing, even with the sunspots. It is a general trend up.Second, I already refuted the CO2 connection.I will post a some graphs to help visualize this:      [13] Which one correlates better?  [3] Longer term, here is a correlation of a solar proxy to a temperature proxy for a period of 3000 years. Values of carbon-14 (produced by cosmic rays, hence a proxy for solar activity) correlate extremely well with oxygen-18 (temperature proxy).  The lower graph shows a particularly well-resolved time interval from 8,350 to 7,900 years BP.  The above graph summarizes data obtained from a stalagmite from a cave in Oman.  [3] Good correspondence between temperature and solar irradiance proxy reconstructions as shown on the graph above.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank jh12341 for presenting his arguments. I. The Universe and Global WarmingThe current state of the Galaxy and our Sun is affecting our temperatures.I.i. The Rest of the Solar SystemThe Sun clearly is in a warmer phase, because all of the other planets have increasing temperatures as well. 'In 2005 data from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor and Odyssey missions revealed that the carbon dioxide 'ice caps' near Mars's south pole had been diminishing for three summers in a row.Habibullo Abdussamatov, head of space research at St. Petersburg's Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory in Russia, says the Mars data is evidence that the current global warming on Earth is being caused by changes in the sun.'[1]''Global warming on Neptune's moon Triton as well as Jupiter and Pluto, and now Mars has some [scientists] scratching their heads over what could possibly be in common with the warming of all these planets … Could there be something in common with all the planets in our solar system that might cause them all to warm at the same time?''[2] Two things can be drawn from this. One, that if other planets are warming, that it is only natural for the Earth to be warming as well. And second, that even if all these planets did have natural causes, then that is a sign of Earth's natural climatic change, instead of man-made. I.ii. The Position of the Milky Way GalaxyEvery approximately 135 million years, Earth enters a more populated area of the Milky Way, and as a result, more cosmic rays hit the Earth, which causes cooling. Currently, we are in a less populated area of the Milky Way, which means that less of these cosmic rays will be hitting the Earth, which means less cloud formation, and of course, warming. [3] for the source on this hypothesis. The sun can also cause this through evaporation.II. Earthly CausesThere are many internal causes of Global Warming as well. II.i. Ocean Current Anomalies Ocean temperature anomalies seem to be rising-along with the temperature. '...one can model past temperatures as a linear trend (that started well before CO2 was added in any substantial quantity) and periodic bumps... ...temperatures over the last 100+ years look a lot like a linear trend plus ocean cycle-driven bumps'[4] What is causing all the bumps?:  [4]As shown in the graph, the PDO, or ocean currents, temperature has affected the average Earth's temperature.    II.ii. Clouds: A Continuation of Point I.ii.I mentioned about the position of the Milky Way Galaxy and the Sun in regards to these 'cosmic rays'. Here is a more in depth look at the effects of position. 'The implications, if true, had potentially enormous implications for the debate about natural causes of warming. When the sun is very active, it can be thought of as pushing away cosmic rays from the Earth, reducing their incidence. When the sun is less active, we see more cosmic rays. This is fairly well understood. But if Svensmark was correct, it would mean that periods of high solar output should coincide with reduced cloud formation (due to reduced cosmic race incidence), which in turn would have a warming effect on the Earth, since less sunlight would be reflected back into space before hitting the Earth.Here was a theory, then, that would increase the theoretical impact on climate of an active sun, and better explain why solar irradiance changes might be underestimating the effect of solar output changes on climate and temperatures.'[4]'Since he first suggested his hypothesis over a decade and a half ago, Svensmark and other researchers have slowly been putting together research to test it.' The results were: 'Scientists found that when shielding was removed and natural cosmic rays allowed to hit the chamber, cloud seeding increased dramatically, and it increased substantially again when additional artificial cosmic rays were added. Svensmark appears to have gotten it right.'[5] Proof here is in the next points. III. The 1500-Year Cycle This has to do with a cycle of the climate that can explain the warming. 'Through at least the last million years, a moderate 1500-year warm-cold cycle has been superimposed over the longer, stronger Ice Ages and warm interglacials.'[6]  Here is a graph related to this:     [7]There are two things we can conclude from this graph. First, that up-and-down cycles are normal for the long-term climate. This century's global warming is nothing new. The second thing we can conclude, is that today's global warming is not as bad as the Medieval Warm Period's peak yet, and the Medieval Warm Period was less than the Holocene Maximum Period.    'Even more important, the earth is not 'the warmest it has ever been.' In fact, the earth was much warmer during the Medieval Warm Period when human agriculture flourished!'[7]'The scientists found evidence that on average, every 1,470 years, plus or minus 500 years, cold, ice-bearing waters, which today circulate around southern Greenland, pushed as far south as Great Britain.'[8] There seems to be a full cycle of up-down-up temperatures of the climate every 1470 years. And this goes as far back as at least 1 million years ago. Currently, we are in an upswing of temperatures, just coming off of the Little Ice Age, the peak to be in a few hundred years, making the peak-to-peak difference between today's global warming and the Medieval Warm Period a little less than 1500 years. So today's Global Warming is a natural, cyclical occurence.    IV. The Sun: The Proof of Theories I.ii and II.iiThe sun's cycles have a lot to do with temperatures also.  'In this chamber, 63 CERN scientists from 17 European and American institutes have done what global warming doomsayers said could never be done — demonstrate that cosmic rays promote the formation of molecules that in Earth’s atmosphere can grow and seed clouds, the cloudier and thus cooler it will be. Because the sun’s magnetic field controls how many cosmic rays reach Earth’s atmosphere (the stronger the sun’s magnetic field, the more it shields Earth from incoming cosmic rays from space), the sun determines the temperature on Earth.'[9]'Svensmark matched the data on cosmic rays from the neutron monitor in Climax, Colorado, with the satellite measurements of solar irradiance from 1970 to 1990. Over the period between 1975 and 1989, he found cosmic rays decreased by 1.2 percent annually, amplifying the sun's change in irradiance about four-fold'[6]So, as the sun's activity increases, so does the temperature. This below graph shows the correlation:   [10]This graph clearly shows that temperature goes up and down with solar activity, because an increase in solar activity directly correlates with an increase in average temperature 1-2 years later. And as a final side note, I would like to present this graph that helps disprove the anthropogenic cause theory, regarding again, natural cycles:  [4] So 'nature' created the same temperature trend as 'humans' did. Hmmm. </t>

    <t>I would like to thank jh1234l for his response.First, I will refute my opponent's arguments, and then I will defend my own.My opponent hasn't given any proof to his arguments. He shows that temperatures have increased, that CO2 concentrations have increased, and that the latter is caused by humans. However, he has failed to provide any correlation between CO2 and temperature; meaning that he has not proven how CO2 causes temperature increases. I will respond in more detail when my opponent posts fuller arguments, but I will make a small comment here:'In the last decade, there has been no clear warming trend (as the UK Met Office and IPCC’s own figures demonstrate). In the last century, much of the warming occurred prior to 1940, when human emissions of CO2 were relatively small compared to today. During the post-war economic boom (when one would have expected the temperature to rise) the world cooled, from the 1940s till the mid-70s (again, this is evident from accepted data used by the IPCC).'[1]     [2]As shown, CO2 does not correlate with temperatures that well. I will now wait for my opponent to respond to his fallacy and my small argument.Now on to defending my arguments. I. The Universe and Global WarmingI.i. The rest of the Solar System  I'll get to cosmic rays later for the Mars part, but my opponent has failed to respond to my second source on this. I'll post more:'...it was noted the planet [Mars] was experiencing rapid warming, similar to what the Earth is currently undergoing.... The Martian icecaps are melting at a perilous pace.... ...and that both [warmings on Earth and Mars] can be explained by changes in solar irradiance.'[3]'Global warming was detected on Jupiter last year, and the warming is apparently behind the formation of a second red spot. Global warming on Neptune's moon Triton has also been noted, with severe atmospheric changes as a result. And even tiny Pluto has experienced moderate warming in recent years, with temperatures rising a full 3.5 degrees. The common denominator in all these cases, the Earth included, is of course the Sun, which is in the middle of an extremely active period at present.'[3]So yes, all of these bodies are indeed warming, and it can all be attributed to increases in solar irradiance.I.ii. The Position of the Milky Way GalaxyMy opponent has also failed to adequately respond to this. Again, I will cover this in more detail when I get to cosmic rays. II. Earthly Causes  II.i. Ocean Current Anomalies  When examining the temperature and CO2 data, the correlation is striking. CO2 only correlates on a .44 scale (r = .44). This means the correlation rates from “fair” to “poor”, which is bad news for an alarmist. It shows the correlation is not very strong. The correlation between the two main ocean currents, PDO and AMO, is particularly striking. The correlation is .83, the paper argues the correlation is in the “good” range, showing promise for this factor in the modern warming. It also shows its R2 is stronger then the CO2 correlation by a factor of almost two. The scientific paper then examines data within the last ten years, the results? A CO2 correlation is no match at all. The correlation is only 0.02. (r = 0.02). If CO2 was the main driver of climate, then why isn’t the correlation higher in the past century, and so low within the last decade?[4][5]This can show the real correlation:   [4]II.ii. Clouds My opponent has not responded to this argument.  So, on cosmic rays, my opponent has not refuted the correlation between them, the fact that cosmic rays cause more cloud formation, or the fact that cosmic rays mean less solar radiation. He has dropped the whole argument. You can easily see the direct correlation between cosmic rays and temperature: 'The graph below shows a correlation between the cosmic ray counts and the global troposphere temperature radiosonde data. The cosmic ray scale is inverted to correspond to increasing temperatures. High solar activity corresponds to low cosmic ray counts, reduced low cloud cover, and higher temperatures. The upper panel shows the troposphere temperatures in blue and the cosmic ray count in red. The lower panel shows the match achieved by removing El Nino, the North Atlantic Oscillation, volcanic aerosols and a linear trend of 0.14 Celsius/decade.'[2]. And the graph:  [2]III. The 1500-Year CycleMy opponent has also failed to respond to this argument adequately. He first attacks the ISIL, even though they are a respectable organization, then he proceeds to take a quote from it out of context, and finally concludes with an irrelevant quote. If my opponent wants more information: 'These are the Medieval Warm Period, which is  well known, but also a period during the toga-wearing Roman times when  temperatures were apparently 1 deg C warmer than now.'[6] This is backed up by tree ring research.'Indirect evidence suggests that the average temperature was as much as 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than today.'[7]And another graph:    [8] IV. The Sun My opponent yet again fails to respond to my argument. It is not refuted in his I.ii.  Some more info on the topic:'Changes in the Sun can account for major climate changes on Earth for the past 300 years, including part of the recent surge of global warming, 300 years, including part of the recent surge of global warming'[9]And another graph showing sunspot count (the higher the sunspot count, the greater the solar activity) versus climate. Pretty good correlation:     [8] I encourage my opponent to actually try and counter my arguments instead of committing logical fallacies and red herrings. I look forward to the next round with a sense of hope. </t>

    <t>Thanks to Ron-Paul for the response.  CO2 Correlation  The sunspots actually rose after the temperature in 1960, according to the chart from [A]. If my opponent's claim is right, then global warming causes sunspots to rise, which is not the case. The chart from [A] shows a strong correlation between CO2 and temperature, in the short term without apparent lag.  Sun  'Sun - Recent Activity Highest in 8000 Years and magnetic field has decreased in size by 25%'  Again, my sun argument still stands. Predictions say that Solar Cycle 24 will have a peak sunspot number of 90, the lowest of any cycle since 1928 when Solar Cycle 16 peaked at 78. Right now, the solar cycle is in a valley--the deepest of the past century. In 2008 and 2009, the sun set Space Age records for low sunspot counts, weak solar wind, and low solar irradiance. The sun has gone more than two years without a significant solar flare. [B] The sun is not in a period of high activity.  'Also, by the way, since CO2 does not correlate with temperatures, your Pluto-to-Earth claim is fallacious.'  I have proven this wrong with [A].  Cosmic Rays  The most recent IPCC studies disputed the mechanism. The 2007 IPCC reports, however, strongly attribute a major role of anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the ongoing global warming, but as 'different climate changes in the past had different causes' a driving role of carbon dioxide in the geological past is neither focus of the IPCC nor purported. [C]  PDO/AMO  The 10-year correlation record of CO2 is on there, but the 10 year correlation record of PDO/AMO is not on there, therefore this does not prove that CO2 has less influence.  'There. Cosmic rays, the sun, and all the Earth's natural cycles have a .95 correlation. '  The PDO/AMO does not have a 10 year chart to compare with CO2, the sun is refuted in earlier rounds. The sunspots are lagging behind the temperature. IPCC disputes the cosmic rays and instead attribute the warming to CO2.  Position in galaxy (Only a chart given by opponent)  Per Ron-Paul's request, this is the full quote: (formatting changed for character count, no changes in content, words taken out in R3 are marked) ' To combat global warming, militants say we must all accept drastic reductions in our standard of living starting now, steadily increasing year-after-year, until much of industrial society is swept away. Only thus can the earth, and perhaps mankind, be saved. [[To achieve this radical restructuring of human society, global warming proponents demand that we give virtually unlimited power to government to control what we eat, how we travel, and how our industries operate, with no dissent or resistance permitted.]] Cars, jet travel for the public, air conditioning, refrigeration, and indeed many if not most of the conveniences of modern life will simply have to be abolished, as quickly as politically feasible. As one environmental activist puts it, Everything modern has to go!' -ISIL  Medieval Warm Period  'I will keep coming with more. There is a clear correlation.' There is no correlation if you give nothing to compare.  The data before 1600 was scarce [D], which means that the temperatures can be colder or warmer than now, but the chart at [E] shows that the MWP is colder than the temperature at 2004.  The Sun  Back in 2008, the solar cycle plunged into the deepest minimum in nearly a century. Sunspots all but vanished, solar flares subsided, and the sun was eerily quiet. As 2011 unfolds, sunspots have returned and they are crackling with activity. On February 15th and again on March 9th, Earth orbiting satellites detected a pair of 'X-class' solar flares--the most powerful kind of x-ray flare. The last such eruption occurred back in December 2006. [F]  As you can see, the solar activity was unstable. Then we should see many huge dips and rises in the chart at http://ossfoundation.us... , but the sun spots dipped down in 2000, while the temperature still rose with the CO2 with little to none delays on the CO2 part. CO2 correlates more than sun spots on [A]. And [A] is a short term graph from 1860 to 2000, so the CO2 should be delayed like crazy, right? Nope, that is not the case.  In Conclusion, my opponent's claims have been refuted.</t>

    <t>Thanks to Ron-Paul for a well written response.  Correlation between CO2 and Temperature  The records have shown strong correlations between climate and CO2 levels, as seen in the graph at [1].  'The world cooled from 1940-1970.'  Your source for this is not accurate, and is shown to be a misrepresentation of temperature records.[2] As shown, CO2 does correlate to the temperature records, so this argument is refuted.  I.i The Rest of The Solar System  The warming on Mars can be caused by reasons other than the Sun. Jeffery Plaut, a scientist from NASA, said 'It's believed that what drives climate change on Mars are orbital variations, the Earth also goes through orbital variations similar to that of Mars.'[3] The warming on Triton, could be the result of an extreme southern summer on the moon, a season that occurs every few hundred years, as well as possible changes in the makeup of surface ice that caused it to absorb more of the Sun's heat. [3] As you can see, there are other possible explanations for this, not just the sun.  Earthly Causes  'When examining the temperature and CO2 data, the correlation is striking. CO2 only correlates on a .44 scale (r = .44). This means the correlation rates from 'fair' to 'poor', which is bad news for an alarmist. It shows the correlation is not very strong.'  The cosmic rays only correlate at an 0.31-0.47, as stated by you, but anyways I'll go on.  'The correlation between the two main ocean currents, PDO and AMO, is particularly striking. The correlation is .83, the paper argues the correlation is in the 'good' range, showing promise for this factor in the modern warming. It also shows its R2 is stronger then the CO2 correlation by a factor of almost two. The scientific paper then examines data within the last ten years, the results? A CO2 correlation is no match at all. The correlation is only 0.02. (r = 0.02). If CO2 was the main driver of climate, then why isn't the correlation higher in the past century, and so low within the last decade?'  The paper, however, did not give a 10 years for PDO and AMO, so there is no comparison. We need the 10-year for PDO and AMO for actual comparison.  The Position In Galaxy amp; Cosmic Rays  First, I have not taken the quote out of context, only shortened it for the word limit. Anyways, I'll continue. If you look at my edited version at [4], you will see that it doesn't correlate much. Plus, the lower chart removed the linear trend (Caused by CO2 increases, possibly, as CO2 does correlate to the climate [1] and it increased by 2 ppm/yr from 2000-2009[5]), causing it to look more 'correlated', which is just a result of editing.  Medieval Warm Period  This period has very little temperature records, and the temperature may be below the temperature now. Wikipedia said that despite substantial uncertainties, the warmest period of the last 2,000 years prior to the 20th century very likely occurred between 950 and 1100, but temperatures were probably between 0.1 'C and 0.2 'C below the 1961 to 1990 mean and significantly below the level shown by instrumental data after 1980. [6]  Sunspots  An international panel of experts led by NOAA and sponsored by NASA has released a new prediction for the next solar cycle. Solar Cycle 24 will peak, they say, in May 2013 with a below-average number of sunspots.[7] While there is not yet a definitive link between solar sunspot activity and global temperatures, the scientists conducting the solar activity study believe that global greenhouse gas emissions would prevent any possible cold snap.[8]  From this information, the globe should be cold now, but 2011 was the warmest La Ni'a year in the period from 1950 to 2011. </t>

    <t>Thanks to my opponent for a well written response.  I.i. The rest of the solar system  While fluctuations in solar activity can affect Earth's climate, the majority of climate scientists and astrophysicists agree that the sun is not to blame for the current and historically sudden uptick in global temperatures on Earth, which seems to be mostly created by humans. [1]  Abdussamatov blamed solar fluctuations for the attenuation of ice caps on Mars. However, these changes were likely not due to the Sun, but rather increases in atmospheric clouds or aerosols that reflected solar radiation back into space.[1]  Charles Long, a climate physicist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratories in Washington, says that Abdussamatov's idea is nonsense. [1]  I.ii. The Position of the Milky Way Galaxy  'Every approximately 135 million years, Earth enters a more populated area of the Milky Way, and as a result, more cosmic rays hit the Earth, which causes cooling.'  135 million years.  Wikipedia says: 'Global warming is the rise in the average temperature of Earth's atmosphere and oceans since the late 19th century and its projected continuation. Since the early 20th century, Earth's mean surface temperature has increased by about 0.8 'C (1.4 'F).'[2]  This was nowhere near 135 million years. How could this suddenly happen?  II. Earthly causes  I.i. Ocean Current Anomalies  'Ocean temperature anomalies seem to be rising-along with the temperature.'

    <t>first of all let me proof that global warming is happening . The 10 indicators are:  Land surface air temperature as measured by weather stations. You know all those skeptic arguments about how the temperature record is biased by the urban heat island effect, badly-sited weather stations, dropped stations, and so on? This is the only indicator which suffers from all those problems. So if you're arguing with somebody who tries to frame the discussion as being about land surface air temperature, just remind them about the other nine indicators. Sea surface temperature. As with land temperatures, the longest record goes back to 1850 and the last decade is warmest. Air temperature over the oceans. Lower troposphere temperature as measured by satellites for around 50 years. By any of these measures, the 2000s was the warmest decade and each of the last three decades has been much warmer than the previous one. Ocean heat content, for which records go back over half a century. More than 90% of the extra heat from global warming is going into the oceans ' contributing to a rise in' Sea level. Tide gauge records go back to 1870, and sea level has risen at an accelerating rate. Specific humidity, which has risen in tandem with temperatures. Glaciers. 2009 was the 19th consecutive year in which there was a net loss of ice from glaciers worldwide. Northern Hemisphere snow cover, which has also decreased in recent decades. Perhaps the most dramatic change of all has been in Arctic sea ice. Satellite measurements are available back to 1979 and reliable shipping records back to 1953. September sea ice extent has shrunk by 35% since 1979. Science isn't like a house of cards, in that removing one line of evidence (eg. land surface air temperature) wouldn't cause the whole edifice of anthropogenic global warming to collapse. Rather, 'land surface warming' is one of more than ten bricks supporting 'global warming'; and with global warming established, there is a whole other set of bricks supporting 'anthropogenic global warming'. To undermine these conclusions, you'd need to remove most or all of the bricks supporting them ' but as the evidence continues to pile up, that is becoming less and less likely.  now global warming is caused by humans , proofs are - 1.Humans are currently emitting around 30 billion tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere every year (CDIAC). Of course, it could be coincidence that CO2 levels are rising so sharply at the same time so let's look at more evidence that we're responsible for the rise in CO2 levels. When we measure the type of carbon accumulating in the atmosphere, we observe more of the type of carbon that comes from fossil fuels (Manning 2006). This is corroborated by measurements of oxygen in the atmosphere. Oxygen levels are falling in line with the amount of carbon dioxide rising, just as you'd expect from fossil fuel burning which takes oxygen out of the air to create carbon dioxide (Manning 2006). Further independent evidence that humans are raising CO2 levels comes from measurements of carbon found in coral records going back several centuries. These find a recent sharp rise in the type of carbon that comes from fossil fuels (Pelejero 2005). So we know humans are raising CO2 levels. What's the effect? Satellites measure less heat escaping out to space, at the particular wavelengths that CO2 absorbs heat, thus finding 'direct experimental evidence for a significant increase in the Earth's greenhouse effect'. (Harries 2001, Griggs 2004, Chen 2007). If less heat is escaping to space, where is it going? Back to the Earth's surface. Surface measurements confirm this, observing more downward infrared radiation (Philipona 2004,Wang 2009). A closer look at the downward radiation finds more heat returning at CO2 wavelengths, leading to the conclusion that 'this experimental data should effectively end the argument by skeptics that no experimental evidence exists for the connection between greenhouse gas increases in the atmosphere and global warming.' (Evans 2006). If an increased greenhouse effect is causing global warming, we should see certain patterns in the warming. For example, the planet should warm faster at night than during the day. This is indeed being observed (Braganza 2004, Alexander 2006). Another distinctive pattern of greenhouse warming is cooling in the upper atmosphere, otherwise known as the stratosphere. This is exactly what's happening (Jones 2003). With the lower atmosphere (the troposphere) warming and the upper atmosphere (the stratosphere) cooling, another consequence is the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere, otherwise known as the tropopause, should rise as a consequence of greenhouse warming. This has been observed (Santer 2003). An even higher layer of the atmosphere, the ionosphere, is expected to cool and contract in response to greenhouse warming. This has been observed by satellites (La'tovi?ka 2006).</t>

    <t>Scientists have concluded that most of the observed warming is very likely due to the burning of coal, oil, and gas. This conclusion is based on a detailed understanding of the atmospheric greenhouse effect and how human activities have been tweaking it. At the same time, other reasonable explanations, most notably changes in the Sun, have been ruled out.  The atmospheric greenhouse effect naturally keeps our planet warm enough to be livable. Sunlight passes through the atmosphere. Light-colored surfaces, such as clouds or ice caps, radiate some heat back into space. But most of the incoming heat warms the planet's surface. The Earth then radiates some heat back into the atmosphere. Some of that heat is trapped by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide (CO2). Human activity--such as burning fossil fuels--causes more greenhouse gases to build up in the atmosphere. As the atmosphere 'thickens' with more greenhouse gases, more heat is held in. Fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas are high in carbon and, when burned, produce major amounts of carbon dioxide or CO2. A single gallon of gasoline, when burned, puts 19 pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</t>

    <t>Hello Woojin05. I accept your challenge and look forward to our debate and the rounds that will follow! Here we go...  Global Warming is a reality, a problem and our fault. According to the Inquisitition of Climate Science, since 1800, 330 billion tons of Carbon Dioxide have been pumped into the atmosphere due to factories burning fossil fuels creating a 'greenhouse effect,' trapping sunlight, raising temperatures. This is also the cause for the largest global temperature increase mankind has ever encountered. According to the National Climatic Data Center, in the last century the average temperature has increased 1.33 degrees, and is projected to increase another 2.5-10.4 degrees by 21-hundred. The Institute for Demographic Research predicts that this temperature increase would raise ocean levels to the point where 634 million people living on the coast would be forced to re-locate. It is for this reason, that I support the resolution that Resolved: Developed countries have a moral obligation to mitigate the effects of Climate Change. As my first contention, I would like to raise the issue about who is in fact responsible for global warming. According to the World Resources Institue, 'industrialized countries account for roughly 80% of the carbon dioxide buildup in the atmosphere to date'. Industrialized countries. Not underdeveloped countries. There is additional evidence to support this. Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide tend to stay in the atmosphere for decades. Old injuries dealt to the enviorment from now developed countries' haven't healed yet. A study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development shows that the countries with the top annual carbon pollution per capita, are all industrialized and developed. Therefore it is developed countries that are responsible for global warming, and from the moral standpoint that this preposition wishes for us to take, it is developed countries who are responsible for mitigating the effects of climate change. It is essential to understand that climate change can be fixed. According to Royters, we have until 2040 to stop global warming before it becomes irreversible. There is a way to save our planet. However this solution is so obvious that it is often overlooked. Cutting pollution emissions by 80%, and replacing them with natural energy would literally halt the growth of climate change, which would end all effects of climate change. Admittedly, this solution comes with a high price tag. It could cost 1.9 trillion dollars annually to cut our carbon emissions by 80%. However this price tag is nothing compared to the cost of letting global warming continue. According to the Natural Resource Defense Council it is estimated that dealing with the effects of global warming would cost 20 trillion dollars a year by the end of the century, costing 10x more money than it would to just stop global warming. Each of the top 30 developed countries, have the budget to pay for approximently 4 % of the emissions decrease. This money could be funded by tax increases, charities, or budget cuts. In contrast there is mathematically no possible way of dealing with the effects of global warming without bankrupting the world's economy. Now the logical question is: Why can't developing countries assist in the costs of mitigating climate change? The answer is because they do not have the money. The average annual salary of a person living in a third world country is 730 dollars, or about 2 dollars a day. On top of this between 60-80% of this money is spent on food. There is no conceivable way a government could make money from taxing these people. As proof of this, the U.S.'s national budget is around 2.1 trillion dollars per year, whereas Zimbobwae's national budget is only 2.7 million dollars per year. Their budget is mathematically practically a millionth of the United States's budget, and Zimbobwae is an average third world country. These countries need every penny they can make, therefore they cannot be obligated to mitigate the effects of climate change. It's that simple. It is time to accept a reality and a responsibility. Therefore developed countries have a moral obligation to mitigate the effects of climate change.</t>

    <t>I will be using the social contract where a country only has an obligation to its self  'The EPA Has been funded highly in the last 10 years but has come up with little to no change to the environment what so ever' 2010 BBC Article  I stand in firm negation on the resolution, Resolved: Devloped Countries have a moral obligation to mitigate the effects of climate change.  My case is backed by two contentions: Developed countries already fund unsuccessful environmental programs  Contention 2: There are other issues that are a higher priority to developed.  On to my first contention, According to the Library of congress the EPA gets an annual budget of eight billion dollars a year, and rarely if ever come up with successful solutions to pollution or climate change. The BBC has reported multiple time of the success rate of the Epa and The british environmental conservation agency stating that both programs are failures and taxpayers should not be paying for them. As I have shown, developed countries have Environmental programs, countries like the USA, Britain , Canada, Australia, France,Spain and Portugal all have developed environmental programs, so countries have already accomplished the resolution. Also according to the British Environmental Conservation agency, climate change is only studied 3 months out of the 12 as stated by professor Martin Anthony of Cambridge university ' what is the point of studying climate climate change if there is no way to control it. So if there is no way to control climate change why should developed countries make it a priority. This brings me to my next contention: Developed Countries have higher priorities. NASA States that climate change is a natural occurrence and as Professor martin Anthony of Cambridge university stated that there is no way to control climate change. Why should climate change be so high on the agenda? It shouldn't, so the money used to fund these environmental agency's in developed country's can be used elsewhere, such as war effort, poverty and healthcare, the eight billion dollars that goes to the EPA can be used to minimize poverty, fund wars and fund healthcare. Climate change should not be a high priority in today agenda. In conclusion I have proven that Developed country's already have funded programs that involved in environmental study and that climate change is not a priority to developed countries. With that I urge a vote in negation on the resolution. Thank you</t>

I must apologise for the poor quality of my response; I managed to misplace my AlphaSmart and shall be unable to locate it until Monday at the soonest.  Firstly, I would like to ask my opponent for his sources; I am unable to locate the BBC article and the only Martin Anthony I could find teaches at the London School of Economics and Political Science.  Note that Con's arguments will be labeled C1, C2, C3, etc.; mine will be labeled P1, P2, P3, etc.  C1: The EPA does not only deal with climate change. It also deals with endangered species (though not to a great extent), hazardous waste disposal, and non-climate related pollution[1]. Furthermore, the efficiency of the EPA is irrelevant to a debate as to the moral obligation to mitigate climate change, unless it is showed to be common to all attempts to deal with climate change.  C2: The greenhouse effect is well supported[2]. We emit greenhouse gases. If we stop emitting greenhouse gases, and even possibly start removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, then logically this would reduce the greenhouse effect, lowering the amount by which the world warms.  P1: The Maldives are currently trying to buy land in other countries, as they expect to be underwater if nothing is done about global warming. If they do purchase land (in, for instance, Australia, which is one of their potential targets), then they shall definitely cause a problem as they, and the country surrounding them, adjust to having another sovereign country in the middle of them. Not to mention the possibility that some people living there might not take kindly the Maldives moving in.[3][4] </t>

Nor does my argument rely on humans causing the increase in carbon dioxide; we can remove carbon dioxide from the air regardless of the source.  C2: Firstly, this says 'developed countries' not 'USA'. Secondly, regardless of whether or not developed countries care, other countries will, and may (if they feel threatened enough) decide that they should enact sanctions on developed countries, or band together to attack them. Or present us with an embargo on their oil.  Furthermore, global warming is predicted to cause: *negative effects in agriculture (wildfires, droughts) including to areas such as the Western United States and the Colorado River Basin *increased spread of mosquito born diseases (dengue fever, malaria) to places including the United States[2] *negative effects on ecotourism incomes as coral reefs die off (think Australia) </t>

My opponent has also not attacked my second contention so I assume that my opponent has accepted that developed nations have other bigger priority's. My opponent stated in his first speech that greenhouse gases are hurting the environment. If these gases are so harmful, how come there is no law banning them?

    <t>For the purpose of this debate I propose the following definitions. Developed countries is a term used to identify the wealthiest nations in the world, which include Western Europe, the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. (ww Norton amp; co. economics textbook) Moral obligation is a duty arising out of considerations of right and wrong (Princeton University)  For our framework, we will be using utilitarianism, which is that actions should be directed toward promoting the greatest happiness of the greatest number of persons. Specifically, according to utilitarian philosophers Peter Singer and Henry Sidgwick, 'there are moral assertions that we recognise intuitively as true... suffering is intrinsically bad, and... people's preferences should be satisfied.' To the topic, this means that mitigating the effects of climate change is necessary for providing the greatest happiness to the most people.  Contention 1: Developed countries are largely responsible for climate change  It is common truth that industrialized nations bear more responsibility for human-induced climate change. This is because over the years, dating back to the Industrial revolution, humans have been producing greenhouse gases that have influenced Earth's atmosphere. As such it would be unfair to ask developing countries to act similarly as developed countries. 'When the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was formulated ... the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities was acknowledged. ... [T]his principle recognized that 'The largest share of historical and current global emissions of greenhouse gases has originated in developed countries; 'Per capita emissions in developing countries are still relatively low; 'The share of global emissions originating in developing countries will grow to meet their social and development needs.'(The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) As a result, Today's developed nations are responsible for global warming and the effects of which we see today. And it is unfair to expect undeveloped world to make the same emissions reductions.  Contention 2: Developed countries are the only ones with the capabilities to act on climate change  No only do developed nation have the most to cut per capita, but they are also the only ones that have the technological advancements and resources to combat climate change. As such they have an obligation to use these resources to fix their planet. More importantly, the developed countries have the research capabilities to create the technology to make a green self-sustaining economy. For example, Italy for the first time has been able to utilize solar power to produce more electricity than wind power, thus accounting for nearly 3.2% of their total energy needs. In addition, by being at the forefront of this technology, Italy, a country constantly on the brink of economic disaster, has been able to become more stabilized and focus its energy on expanding its renewable energy market.(renewable energy world) Further, the developed world has the finance and expertise to develop these projects and implement and manage them all around the world. As the nations with the greatest capability, the developed world has the increased responsibility to act for the betterment of all.  Contention 3: The greatest impact will come when the largest emitters of greenhouse gases make reductions.  Developed countries emit the most greenhouse gases per capita, in 2008 the US emitted 17.9 tonnes compared to China's 5.3 tons per person. If reductions are made in such nations, then we will see a much bigger impact in the climate than if it came from developing nations. In addition, the developed countries with high CO2 emissions can reduce output through lifestyle changes. For example, biking to work instead of taking the car or cutting back on the junk food now and then. For developing nations, changes like that can not be made. They would have to change their entire economy and route to development to meat such needs even though they don't produce all that much in the first place. In the future, these developing nations will look to the actions of the developed world to plan for their future. By combating climate change, we ensure that everyone will eventually reach a point in which we can eliminate emissions all together.  Now onto my opponents case. His first part of his case talks about the term for developed countries being to broad, but yet offered a definition for it that narrows it down to the most developed. to counter this is will offer 5 of the most developed countries that I will be basing my arguments off of for this debate. 1. Norway 2. Australia 3. Netherlands 4. United States 5. New Zealand  Now onto my opponents first contention, his first contention only talks about the cost, yet cooling the ocean floor they average will only cost about 14 billion dollars and make 30 billion dollars back in agriculture growth. His second contention then talks about how climate change is uncontrollable, once again you can go back to the fact that cooling the ocean floor or simply reducing are CO2 intake will drastically decrease the weather. his 3rd contention talks about how the mitigation of climate change is not a moral obligation where he talks about how Norway is in debt almost $644.5 billion dollars, this is just giving us more of a reason to put this into place. Not only will we save money from this but we will also stop the temperatures from causing anymore mass destruction.  In Conclusion Global warming is an outcome of human activities rather than a natural disaster. Without maximum action from the developed world, all countries will be ultimately affected, including the rich countries. I would also like to mention that the temperatures in afghanistan reached almsot 145 degrees over this last summer, for are soldiers that type of weather is hard to bare. Their temperatures have been increasing over 11% every year now for the last 3 years, this amount of increase could lead to world destruction by the year 2018. the time is now to take action.</t>

    <t>My partner and I negate the resolution'Resolved: Developed countries have a moral obligation to mitigate the effects of climate change. A Developed Country is a sovereign state which has a highly developed economy and advanced technological infrastructure relative to other `less developed nations or one that is highly industrialized. The term ' Developed Countries' is too broad. There is a generalization that every developed country emits a significant amount of CO2 and can afford the taxation costs of mitigation. For example, India, even with advanced technology, is in a national debt of $ 345.8 billion. The World Bank classifies all low- and middle-income countries as developing. We feel it necessary to define the following terms: Moral Obligation- an obligation composed of morals of ethics and injustices. Climate change -the perpetual fluctuation in weather patterns in a particular region or worldwide. However, unlike global warming, which refers to just to the accession in the earth's surface temperature' climate change refers to alterations in a regions overall weather patterns, including precipitation, temperatures, cloud cover, Contention I : The cost of mitigating climate change in developed countries will negatively affect the economy. b In order to mitigate climate change as a government , the country must raise taxes. In Australia, Carbon is taxed at 23 per ton. According to the Australian government's modeling, this is likely to cause the cost of living to increase by an average of 0.7 per cent in the first year, and another 0.2 per cent in 2015-16. Every year the price will increase by 2.5% until 2015. Besides Governmental actions, most encouraged ways to control your carbon footprint are inconvenient and expensive. For example, carpooling, hybrid cars, and avoiding reforestation are inconvenient. Most Hybrid cars cost between $2,000 and $10,000 more than a gasoline engine car. To some people, they are not an option because of the higher prices. The average Hybrid has about 15-27 miles per gallon and most new gasoline powered cars get 22-29 mpg. Also, some people cannot lower the amount of gasoline they use. Not all occupants of a country are economically stable and therefore, our economy cannot afford the cost and taxes of mitigation. Contention 2: Certain aspects of climate change are uncontrollable and not caused by humankind. Solar emission and slow changes in the earth's orbital elements are natural causes of climate change. Solar emission is when magnetic energy in the sun has built up. These are not preventable therefore we don't have a moral obligation to mitigate it. Also, plate tectonics are not preventable by humans. It is a significant cause of climate change. Certain climate changes are not preventable. For example, during the ice age, the sea level rose 80 meters. Climate on Earth has changed significantly for over 2.4 billion years, even long before human activity could have played a role. According to the National Ocean Service, 'Starting with the ice ages that have come and gone in regular cycles for the past nearly three million years, there is strong evidence that these are linked to regular variations in the Earth's orbit around the Sun.' Contention III: The Mitigation of climate change is not a moral obligation. Moral Obligations should not exist. A country must stabilize itself before helping others. The fact is that most developed countries have a high national debt and must work on fixing themselves before fixing the world. For example, even the most developed country in the world, Norway is in a national debt of $644.5 billion. The definition of obligation is 'A bond of moral duty.' However, with the job of an obligation, our priorities are minimized especially economically. This is not a moral obligation. In fact, saying that developed countries are morally obligated to mitigate the effects of climate change is unethical. The countries should not be morally obligated to mitigate the effects of climate change; it should only be encouraged to people and therefore the responsibility of the people, not the government. Therefore Mitigating climate change in developed countries is expensive, not all developed countries are stable, and the mitigation of climate change is not a moral obligation. In conclusion, climate change should not be dealt with now because we do not have a moral obligation mitigate it</t>

    <t>To begin with, the definition of developed countries is incorrect. A developed country is a highly industrialized country. Your first contention states that developed countries are largely responsible for climate change. However, this is a broad generalization. Many of the countries that contribute to climate change are still developing because of their large debts. Also, there is a generalization that every country release a significant amount of of CO2. My opponent's case focuses on global warming rather that climate change. My opponent is ignoring that climate change is also caused by uncontrollable changes in our orbit around the sun and solar emissions. My opponent's second argument is that Developed countries are the only one's with capabilities to act on climate change. However, most Developed Countries do have a large national debt. We need to focus on the country's success before fixing the world. His last contention states that the greatest impact will come from when the largest emitters of greenhouse gasses make reductions. However, again this is a huge generalization. Not all developed countries release a signifigant amount of CO2 or even can afford to mitigate the effects of climate change. Your example of the US is irrevlevant. The United States cannot afford to cut back on the use of nonrenewable resources. You provide solutions that are inconvenient. For example, what if you live far from work, or couldn't afford organic foods. My opponent states that cooling the ocean floor only costs $14 billion. However most countries, with a massive debt cannot afford this. For example, take my previous argument that Norway is in a national debt of $644.5 billion. Shouldn't the country try to fix itself before fixing the world? The Norway example does not support the Pro argument. He states that it is more of a reason mitigate the effects of climate change. However, isn't it more of a reason to fix ourselves before the world. My opponent conceptualizes the view of how to mitigate the effects of climate change without providing a valid solution. Obviously $14 billion is not cheap and we should not invest in the world when our own country has economic issues that are not caused by Climate Change. Moreover, the action to mitigate climate change is more of a moral right to an individual rather than a country.</t>

    <t>Resolved: Developed countries have a moral obligation to mitigate the effects of climate change. Quote: 'One of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation.'-Thomas B. Reed Definitions: 'Developed countries: sovereign state which has a highly developed economy and advanced technological infrastructure relative to other less developed nations 'Moral obligation: an obligation arising out of considerations of right and wrong 'Mitigate: to lessen in force or intensity, as wrath, grief, harshness, or pain; moderate 'Effects: a change that is the result or consequence of an action or other cause 'Climate change: is a significant and lasting change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns over periods ranging from decades to millions of years. Contention 1: The economic impact of environmental legislation hurts the economies of developed countries. New regulations planned by the EPA could have detrimental effects to our economy ' particularly causing a loss of jobs, impeding economic recovery and harming livelihoods. The heart of the EPA's regulation would be a backdoor national energy tax that will ultimately kill jobs, stop economic growth and raise the cost of energy, food and transportation. They would also double the current regulatory standard on farm dust that would make tilling a field, operating a feedlot or diving farm vehicles impossible - bringing the agriculture sector to a standstill. A representative from the Virginia Farm Bureau Federation said, 'Farmers and their way of life and livelihood have never felt more challenged or threatened than they do today by the continuous onslaught of regulations and requirements from the Environmental Protection Agency... The cost they represent will impact the economy as a whole, and this committee should not be surprised when our economy contracts and jobs are lost to foreign competition.' An MIT study conducted by Stephen M. Meyers clearly shows that increased environmental regulation burdens the economy, especially in times of economic downfall. So why then, would we want any more ridiculous red tape? An increase in environmental regulation would result in the loss of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars, nobody wants to see that. Contention 2: The Earth's climate is always changing. If you talk to any credible climatologist, they will tell you the Earth's temperature has been much hotter and colder than it is now. Anyone saying that we should reverse the effects of climate change are obviously misinformed and have no scientific background. The climate is always in a state of constant change and development. The Earth goes through natural periods of cooling and warming, that's scientific fact. Would you blame the warming of the Earth after the last Ice Age on humans or man-made greenhouse gases? As with all the climate change nonsense, not a single claim can be substantiated as actual physical proof. Only assumptions and predictions made with manipulated computer models and deliberately corrupted data exist. Actual meteorological records and geophysical records destroy any credibility of everything ever said by these environmental groups. The real agenda of 'global warming' has nothing to do with climate or weather but all to do with politics and the financial gain of those who stand to benefit from green investments. What better an investment could they have than one where the government forces the use of a green scheme idea or product on the public? In a 1996 report by the UN on global warming, two statements were deleted from the final draft. Here they are: 1) 'None of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed climate changes to increases in greenhouse gases.' 2) 'No study to date has positively attributed all or part of the climate change to man'made causes. Contention 3: There is no moral obligation to mitigate climate change because nations are not moral entities. On what grounds are so-called 'developed countries' morally obligated to do anything? The simple fact is that there is no basis for this claim. Individuals, rather than government, determine morals. Government is not, and never has been where you should look for morals; you have that in your own heart and conscience; you teach that to your family. You cannot dictate what morals your neighbor has nor what morals your neighbor teaches his children. Make yourself an example with morals; that is all one can do. And certainly government has no place in that. The whole idea that a country would have a 'moral obligation' is unethical on the basis of Ethical Relativism, that ethics and morals are relative to each Nation or even culture and that there is no standard ethical or moral policy that all nation-states ought to abide by.</t>
<h>    Resolved: Developed countries have a moral obligation to mitigate the effects of climate change.</h>
  </pair>
  <pair id="868" entailment="ENTAILMENT" task="IE">
    <t>Contention I: 'The economic impact of environmental legislation hurts the economies of developed countries.'Pro makes several highly unsupported conjectures in his C1. The main point is that government attempts to curb the effects of global warming would have negative effects on the economy. Among his conjectures include the arguments that EPA regulations would cause 'a loss of jobs, impeding economic recovery and harming livelihoods' as well as 'result in the loss of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars'. Now besides the fact that Pro has neglected to source or substantiate his claims, his point would still fall moot if the effects of global climate change will be worse than the effects of environmental regulations. And scientific consensus supports this position, including the position of the European Academy of Science and Arts[1], the American Association for the Advancement of Science[2], the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change[3], among several other scientific organizations. Contention II: 'The Earth's climate is always changing.'This contention attempts to disprove the existence of man-made global climate change. There are a few problems with this point though. First, even if we were to concede that global climate change isn't man-made, that wouldn't change the existence of moral obligation on those able to do so if we take a utilitarian perspective i.e., global climate change could still pose a grave threat to humanity, thus provoking obligation to those who have the means to mitigate such effects. The second problem with this point is the fact that Pro has failed to provide any evidence to substantiate his claims. He claims that 'Anyone saying that we should reverse the effects of climate change are obviously misinformed and have no scientific background.' What an incredible claim, considering 'That humans are causing global warming is the position of the Academies of Science from 19 countries plus many scientific organizations that study climate science. More specifically, around 95% of active climate researchers actively publishing climate papers endorse the consensus position.'[4] The point is further corroborated by further studies, all available in Source 1.Contention III: 'There is no moral obligation to mitigate climate change because nations are not moral entities.'Pro's third and final contention rests on his conception of nations as non-moral entities. He makes two sub-points in regards to this contention: (a) he argues that a nation exists separately from the people that make them up and (b) with his assuming of ethical relativism in a societal context. I contend that neither of these points hold weight and that Pro is mistaken in his existential characterization of nations.(a) Pro's first mistake in his point is that he conceives nations as something distinct and separate from their individual parts i.e., their citizens. But try to conceive of a nation without citizens. It wouldn't exist. Nations only exist because a group of people come together to organize society. (b) Pro's second mistake lies in his application of ethical relativism. Even if we admit that morals are relative to individuals, Pro's point still fails in that he proves too much. For instance, if morals can only apply to people and not collective entities (assuming such things even exist), then we also can't apply moral criticism to any other collective entities, including corporations, interest groups, or even family households. The only way to overcome this obstacle is to dissolve the existence of collective entities or more than the sum of their parts. We can't apply moral duties to a nation, but we can apply those criticisms to the individual people who make them up.</t>
<h>    Now besides the fact that Pro has neglected to source or substantiate his claims, his point would still fall moot if the effects of global climate change will be worse than the effects of environmental regulations.</h>

    <t>Thanks for the debate Idaho_Rebel.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the leading international body for the assessment of climate change, has stated that climate change has major environmental, social, political, and economic consequences. The issue at stake in this debate, whether developed countries have a moral obligation to mitigate the consequences of climate change, is thus quite necessary.Pro Case1. What are the potential 'effects' of climate change? Atmospheric CO2 concentrations will reach 400ppm by 2017, if not earlier, making a rise in average global temperatures inevitable. It has been predicted that urban 'heat island' effects (the result of rising temperatures) will result in the death of tens of thousands of people across the world. Other predictions include: high-intensity storms and flooding, causing property and infrastructure damage; droughts threatening food and water supplies; wildfires, desertification, and soil erosion destroying agricultural land, raising food prices, and leading to large-scale migrations; and rising sea levels, devastating low-lying coastal settlements (including many major cities).Source: IPCC, 2011: IPCC Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation - http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de...2. Why do 'developed countries' have a moral obligation to mitigate these effects?The potential harms caused by climate change should be readily apparent, so it shouldn't come as a surprise that there is some sort of obligation to mitigate the effects of climate change, regardless of which ethical precept is applied. For example, a utilitarian ethics (greatest good for the greatest number) is just as likely to recommend policies that mitigate the effects of climate change as a Kantian ethics (regarding the rightness of actions themselves). So then, the next question is: 'who' carries the burden or moral obligation to curb the effects of climate change?The issue at stake here is one of responsibility: do particular governments have more responsibility than others?A reasonable principle to apply here would be the 'common but differentiated responsibility' principle: the idea that everyone bears a responsibility to mitigate the effects of climate change, but those with the ability to pay have a greater burden to do so. We could apply other ethical principles, such as the idea of 'intergenerational equity' (the debt to future generations) or 'compensatory equity' (the debt to more socioeconomically vulnerable people). The conclusion of these principles suggests developed countries, who by definition are more advanced economically and technologically, have a greater burden to mitigate the effects of climate change than do currently developing countries.Con CaseRe: 'Contention 1'My opponent's argument, that the 'economic impact of environmental legislation hurts the economies of developed countries,' is flawed for two reasons. First, my opponent completely neglects the possibility of alternative mitigation proposals, some which might even have a positive effect on the economy. For example, the development of drought-resistant crops, storm-resistant housing, climate-resilient infrastructure, and secure food/water supplies could easily produce new jobs and stimulate economic growth. Indeed, there is no need to focus on CO2 emissions when other options exist. In low-lying coastal settlements, for example, we could build sea walls, which are not only cheaper but much more likely to protect than an energy tax.Second, my opponent's argument offers no reason to believe environmental legislation would hurt the economy. How would the EPA's national energy tax 'kill jobs' and 'stop economic growth'? How would it make 'tilling a field' and 'operating a feedlot' impossible? The only answer my opponent provides to these questions is 'foreign competition.' This fear is unfounded, however, because the EPA's regulations only apply to global industries (domestic industries would be unaffected since they all operate under the same restrictions). Moreover, since fossil fuels are already becoming more expensive relative to renewable sources, an energy tax would simply accelerate a transition to 'green energy' that is already underway, including the retraining of carbon-intensive industries for 'green jobs.' The U.S. economy as a whole would remain competitive.Re: 'Contention 2'The argument that humans are not responsible for climate change is irrelevant: assuming climate change is harmful to the well-being of humans, it would not matter who or what was responsible for the harm. The issue at stake in this debate is who is responsible for cleaning up the mess, not who is responsible for creating the mess. To clarify this point, consider Peter Singer's example of a child drowning in a shallow pond: do we have a moral obligation to rescue the child? Yes, we do. Now, suppose someone pushed the child into the shallow pond; does this fact suddenly absolve you of the moral obligation to rescue the child? No, it doesn't.The burden of mitigating the effects of climate change falls on humanity as a whole, with a greater burden placed on those who can better afford to pay for mitigation proposals. The issue of who is responsible for climate change is thus irrelevant.Re: 'Contention 3'My opponent argues that 'nations are not moral entities,' so therefore the 'idea that a country would have a 'moral obligation' is unethical on the basis of Ethical Relativism.' The argument is not only entirely incoherent (how can something be objectively 'unethical' on the basis of 'Ethical Relativism'?), but its premises are flat-out wrong.The problem is that my opponent confuses descriptive ethics with normative ethics, taking the existence of different moral views (it is true that different individuals, cultures, and countries can have different moral doctrines) to establish the lack of a true morality that 'nation-states ought to abide by.' Just because a particular individual or nation believes their moral view is the right one does not make it right. A culture might practice slavery or cannibalism, but the fact they believe these practices ethical does not make itself make these practices ethical.If we employ an objective ethical framework, such as a utilitarian or deontological ethics which both make claims of universality and objectivity, then my opponent's argument is clearly misguided. But suppose we grant my opponent his claim of ethical relativism, that does not mean no ethical precept can be established. It simply means that, from our perspective, what is right is determined by what we believe. That does not mean what we believe is not a 'standard ethical or moral policy.' On the contrary, the whole point of ethical relativism is to establish that our morality is situated in our specific culture, and since our culture is one in which protecting the life and property of our citizens is of ethical importance, mitigating climate change is thus also important.The other point my opponent makes - that individuals, not nations, are moral entities - makes no sense. A country or government has the choice - rational free choice - to make decisions and affect the world, just like an individual. This simple fact makes a country a 'moral entity,' in the sense that my opponent uses the term. The distinction between individual and country does not hold up, because countries are simply the association of individuals for a specific purpose under a particular name. This allows countries to function in the same way as individuals, making them moral entities.</t>

Therefore, to win all I must do is show that the world is not overpopulated.Burden of ProofPro will have the burden of proof as he is putting forth the positive claim.DefinitionsWorld: EarthOverpopulated: The population of an area in too large numbers -----Since Pro has made arguments in round one I assume that this round is for actual arguments and not just acceptance, so here we go.Counter Arguments1. Too many peoplePro claims that there are too many people, and this is just not the case. Every single person on Earth could fit into Texas and have a 66'x66' plot of land (enough for a single family home + yard) [1]. This would leave the entire rest of the inhabitable earth devoid of human life.2. Too few resourcesPro contends that there are too few resources, giving examples such as food and oil. In terms of food the problem isn't that there's too little food, it's that a select few groups of people are eating a disproportionate amount. Consider this; Americans, while only making up 5% of the worlds population, eat almost a quarter of all consumed food (24%). In fact, the average American consumes as much food as 370 Ethiopians. It's not just a matter of food consumed either. Americans throw out 200,000 tons (440,924,400 lbs) of edible food every day [2]. Consider also that less than half as many people die from famine each year now than a century ago, even though our population has quadrupled [4], and World agriculture produces 17 percent more calories per person today than it did 30 years ago, despite a 70 percent population increase [5].In terms of oil, we aren't even close to running out. The end of oil has been predicted for over 100 years now and year after year we see that our oil reserves are actually growing. In 1882 it was estimated that there was only 95 million barrels of oil remaining and that we would run out of oil before the end of the decade. By 1919 (37 years later) we still had oil and it was estimated that we would run out of oil in 20 years. By 1950 (31 years later), there was over 100 billion barrels of oil estimated on reserve. This cycle of people predicting the end of oil and oil reserves increasing has continued until today. Long story short, we now have estimated about 1.25 trillion barrels of oil remaining -- over 13,000x as much oil on reserve as was estimated in 1882 when the death of oil was first predicted [3]. I highly recommend checking out the rest of this video for those of you who want the rest of the figures given. 3. GarbageOnce again, this isn't an issue of numbers, but an issue of poor management. Consider this; 'Due to developments in waste management, the projected landfill waste for the United States (a relatively massive producer of waste) over the entire next century could be stored in a landfill area only 18 miles on each side.' [4].This landfill could even be reduced by upwards of 70% due to recycling [6]. So it's clear that trash is only as big of a problem as we let it be -- and even then how big of a problem it can be is exaggerated.Finally, it has not been established that humans are responsible for climate change. This needs to be established before I can be expected to debunk this claim. 4. Irrelevant ArgumentsThe rest of Pro's argument is about ways we can reduce our population and the projected benefits of a smaller population. There are numerous problems with what he's said, but there's no point in arguing about it because ultimately these things are irrelevant to both of our positions. All Pro needs to establish is that the world is overpopulated and all I need to do is refute his argument for that resolution. Questions of how to do deal with overpopulation are meaningless unless it is established that the world is overpopulated in the first place.ConclusionI've shown that in terms of land, oil and food, the world is not overpopulated nor is it even close to being as such. As it stands right now, Pro's BOP has not been fulfilled.I look forward to your response.</t>

    <t>There are over 7 billion people on the earth. This currently large population is due to proper nutrition and modern medicine. Such a large population requires a large amount of resource that are often limited like coal, oil, land, and sometime food. Humans are also very destructive to the environment by using resources fast than the earth can replenish them. Human presence in an area can also mean the extinction of animals and plant species that can be vital to a balanced and health ecosystem. Developed countries produce so much waste that the environment will be inhabitable to animals or humans. Humans may even be responsible for a climate change. Encourage an intentional population decrease would tramendously help relieve the strain and damage that over population can cause. It can also help economical situations by having more need for workers and consumers. The way we would decrease the population would be to encourage people to have only one kid or no children. Allow the elderly to pass on when they have reached there time. Make suicide legal and to allow those unable to survive with out machines to pass on. These decision would be voluntary and would be a collected effort to keep the environment we live in habitable and to keep the human race from expanding past what the environment can handle. If we don't control the numbe of the population eventually nature will with horrifying and devistating consequences.</t>

    <t>Aff Resolved: Developed countries have a moral obligation to mitigate the effects of climate change.  For the purpose of this debate I propose the following definitions. Developed countries is a term used to identify the wealthiest nations in the world, which include Western Europe, the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. (ww Norton amp; co. economics textbook) Moral obligation is a duty arising out of considerations of right and wrong (Princeton University)  For our framework, we will be using utilitarianism, which is that actions should be directed toward promoting the greatest happiness of the greatest number of persons. Specifically, according to utilitarian philosphers Peter Singer and Henry Sidgwick, 'there are moral assertions that we recognise intuitively as true... suffering is intrinsically bad, and... people's preferences should be satisfied.' To the topic, this means that mitigting the effects of climate change is neccessary for providing the greatest happiness to the most people.  Contention 1: Developed countries are largely responsible for climate change  It is common truth that industrialized nations bear more responsibility for human-induced climate change. This is because over the years, dating back to the Industrial revolution, humans have been producing greenhouse gases that have influenced Earth's atmosphere. As such it would be unfair to ask developing countries to act similarly as developed countries. 'When the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was formulated ... the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities was acknowledged. ... [T]his principle recognized that •The largest share of historical and current global emissions of greenhouse gases has originated in developed countries; •Per capita emissions in developing countries are still relatively low; •The share of global emissions originating in developing countries will grow to meet their social and development needs.'(The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) As a result, Today's developed nations are responsible for global warming and the effects of which we see today. And it is unfair to expect undeveloped world to make the same emissions reductions.  Contention 2: Developed countries are the only ones with the capabilities to act on climate change  No only do developed nation have the most to cut per capita, but they are also the only ones that have the technological advancements and resources to combat climate change. As such they have an obligation to use these resources to fix their planet. More importantly, the developed countries have the research capabilities to create the technology to make a green self-sustaining economy. For example, Italy for the first time has been able to utilize solar power to produce more electricity than wind power, thus accounting for nearly 3.2% of their total energy needs. In addition, by being at the forefront of this technology, Italy, a country constantly on the brink of economic disaster, has been able to become more stabilized and focus its energy on expanding its renewable energy market.(renewable energy world) Further, the developed world has the finance and expertise to develop these projects and implement and manage them all around the world. As the nations with the greatest capability, the developed world has the increased responsibility to act for the betterment of all.  Contention 3: The greatest impact will come when the largest emitters of greenhouse gases make reductions.  Developed countries emit the most greenhouse gases per capita, in 2008 the US emitted 17.9 tonnes compared to China's 5.3 tons per person. If reductions are made in such nations, then we will see a much bigger impact in the climate than if it came from developing nations. In addition, the developed countries with high CO2 emissions can reduce output through lifestyle changes. For example, biking to work instead of taking the car or cutting back on the junk food now and then. For developing nations, changes like that can not be made. They would have to change their entire economy and route to development to meat such needs even though they don't produce all that much in the first place. In the future, these developing nations will look to the actions of the developed world to plan for their future. By combating climate change, we ensure that everyone will eventually reach a point in which we can eliminate emissions all together.  In Conclusion Global warming is an outcome of human activities rather than a natural disaster. Without maximum action from the developed world, all countries will be ultimately affected, including the rich countries.</t>

    <t>Resolved: Developed countries have a moral obligation to mitigate the effects of climate change.  My partner and I stand in firm negation of the resolution. We feel it necessary to define the following terms: Developed Country- is a sovereign state which has a highly developed economy and advanced technological infrastructure relative to other less developed nations. Moral Obligation- an obligation arising out of considerations of right and wrong. Morals are assessed based on the cost and benefits of a situation. Climate Change- Climate change, is a change in the typical or average weather of a region or city. Climate change is also a change in Earth's overall climate. This could be a change in Earth's average temperature. -NASA  Contention 1: Humans have little effect on climate change and yet take on much of the blame for the situation.  Subpoint A:Contrary to popular belief, humans have very little effect on Earth's changing climate. Most changes to climate are a result of geological or natural events, which we have ZERO control over. These include Solar output, Volcanism, Earth's orbital changes, and Plate tectonics. These might seem like they make minor differences, but these are responsible for short and long term climate fluctuations, including ice ages; and it can be agreed on that a massive cooling of the Earth for ten thousand years is a major change in climate. The earth has been going through cycles of cooling and warming for the last ten thousand years, and we have evidence which shows we are actually in a global cooling, which is part of Earth's natural patterns. Why would us humans have any sort of obligation to mitigate the effects of climate change. Climate change is a natural process which we have no control over. Trying to change a natural cycle that has been going on for million of years is completely impossible, and we have no moral obligation to do something impossible.  Subpoint B:Humans are incorrectly accused of the recent warming of the climate. However, this cycle of heating has been happening since humans weren't even fully evolved. A quote from an article of Climate Physics states 'About 450 million years ago the temperature dropped significantly even though the CO2 concentration was about 12 times higher than today. This disproves the hypothesis that CO2 causes global warming.' This is also backed up scientifically. A graph titled 'As carbon dioxide increases it has less warming effect' shows and explains how we can DOUBLE the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere with an almost unnoticeable increase in temperature. Increasing carbon dioxide levels also does not affect the atmosphere. This is because as the concentration of Co2 increases, so does the rate of photosynthesis, resulting in equal amounts of oxygen and carbon dioxide.  Contention 2: Climate change won't have a major impact on human lives  Climate change as a result of human activities doesn't have a major impact on human lives.  Conclusion: Why we aren't obliged Because humans are such a minor influence in climate change, we have no obligation to mitigate climate change. Why would we spend money to change the weather, and a lot of money at that. A book on globalizing renewable energy by 2030 states the cost to do so 'might be on the order of $100 trillion worldwide, over 20 years, not including transmission.' Alternate forms of energy also have major drawbacks, besides being very cost heavy, and these drawbacks do developed countries more harm than good. we have no control over climate change, and even if we did there is no need to worry, as the climate is just following natural patterns.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank my opponent for engaging with me in this great debate. I appreciate your commitment. I. The Current State of the Galaxy AND the Sun? That Is Very Unusual, Since they Do Not Necessarily Correlate  I.i. The Rest of the Solar System  '...it was noted the planet [Mars] was experiencing rapid warming, similar to what the Earth is currently undergoing.... The Martian icecaps are melting at a perilous pace.... ...and that both [warmings on Earth and Mars] can be explained by changes in solar irradiance.'[1]'Global warming was detected on Jupiter last year, and the warming is apparently behind the formation of a second red spot. Global warming on Neptune's moon Triton has also been noted, with severe atmospheric changes as a result. And even tiny Pluto has experienced moderate warming in recent years, with temperatures rising a full 3.5 degrees.  The common denominator in all these cases, the Earth included, is of course the Sun, which is in the middle of an extremely active period at present.'[1]So yes, all of these bodies are indeed warming, and it can all be attributed to increases in solar irradiance.I.ii. The Position of the Milky Way Galaxy ad Cosmic Rays'With the new results just published in the recognised journal Geophysical Research Letters, scientists have succeeded for the first time in directly observing that the electrically charged particles coming from space and hitting the atmosphere at high speed contribute to creating the aerosols that are the prerequisites for cloud formation.'[2] So yes, there is direct proof. Here is a picture explaining how cosmic rays create cloud formation:     [2]  And here is the proof for all of this:   [3]And finally, I know how much my opponent likes long-period graphs, so I thought I would go back 500 million years:     [4] So as shown, cosmic rays create clouds, so fewer cosmic rays create fewer clouds. And, fewer cosmic rays mean more sunspots, which means increased solar activity, which means warming (I will get to this hypothesis later). And, fewer clouds means higher temperatures. And, even if cosmic rays and temperature were diverging, you are ignoring the laws of thermodynamics (I will also get to this later).   II. Earthly Causes II.i. Ocean Current AnomaliesThe graph my opponent presented, when looked at closer, is actually self-defeating. You can see that when the PDO index is negative, temperatures decline, when the PDO index is nil, temperatures remain at the same level, and when the PDO index is positive, temperatures rise. Everyone can see the correlation:  [Your Graph+My Paint Work] Why are they diverging? Because there has been more positive PDO this year than negative, meaning that there will be more warming. This cannot be attributed to man because there is no correlation between CO2 levels and the PDO. 'A warm Pacific (positive PDO Index) as we found from 1922 to 1947 and again 1977 to 1997 has been found to be accompanied by more El Ninos, while a cool Pacific more La Ninas. Since El Ninos have been shown to lead to global warming and La Ninas global cooling, this should have an affect on annual mean temperature trends in North America.'[5]Again, the correlation can be better shown in these graphs:The correlation is very strong here, and, ocean currents rise and fall just before temperatures directly, meaning that ocean currents cause direct temperature changes, not the other way around:       [5] And again, here. As a side note, the upward linear trend started way before CO2 was added in any substantial quantity (i.e. temperature growth is not accelerating). It correlates perfectly:    [6]And finally, I advance this graph again because it shows perfectly my argument. Notice how temperatures start to rise 2-3 years after a PDO cycle change, again indicating that ocean currents cause direct temperature changes:  [6] II.ii. Clouds: A Continuation of Point I.ii.  This is from an experiment at CERN called CLOUD: 'Scientists found that when shielding was removed and natural cosmic rays allowed to hit the chamber, cloud seeding increased dramatically, and it increased substantially again when additional artificial cosmic rays were added.'[7]'They [Researchers] put realistic mixtures of the Earth's atmospheric gases into a large-reaction chamber, with ultraviolet light as a stand-in for the sun. When they turned on the UV, microscopic droplets of sulphuric acid-cloud seeds-started floating through the chamber.'[8]'Carslaw et al. point out that cosmic ray intensity declined by about 15 percent during the last century 'owing to an increase in the solar open magnetic flux by more than a factor of 2.' They further report that 'this 100-year change in intensity is about the same magnitude as the observed change over the last solar cycle.''[9]So yes, there is direct proof of the inverse relationship between cosmic rays and cloud formation. I already proved this correlation in point I.ii., so I will not repeat it here. III. The 1500-Year CycleI will show this graph again, and go even further back than my opponent:    [9]So indeed, the Medieval Warm Period and the Holocene Climate Maximum were higher than today. And, there is ample evidence that the Medieval Warm Period and Holocene Climate Maximum were hotter than today:'Chinese temperatures were 2 to 3 degrees C higher than present during China's climate optimum based on pollen data and the souther limits of permafrost.''The Mediterranean region, including the coast of North Africa, got more rainfall during the Medieval Warming period than it does in our time.''...during the Medieval Warming... . Temperatures may have been as much as 2.5 degrees C warmer [than today] due to a southward shift of the climate belts.'[8]The Medieval Warm Period and the Holocene Climate Maximum were clearly higher in all areas. Here are some graphs showing this:China:    [8]South Africa: [8]As shown, again, the Medieval Warm Period was a lot higher in temperature than today, which was eclipsed [MWP] by the Holocene Climate Maximum.    [10]So, today's warming is clearly not unprecedented. 'These are the Medieval Warm Period, which is  well known, but also a period during the toga-wearing Roman times when  temperatures were apparently 1 deg C warmer than now.'[11] This is backed up by tree ring research.'Indirect evidence suggests that the average temperature was as much as 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than today.'[12]So why this unprecedented warming in your graphs? Because it is scaled badly. It has only gone up 1 degree Celsius. Explain all of the evidence I have. IV. The Sun This is wrong for one reason: thermodynamics. The sun's activity level is so high that even when it stabilizes, there is still going to be an increase in temperatures. Notice temoerature increases are leveling off as the sun's activity decreases.  Still, even if that wasn't true, there is a lag between the lines. The lag is that the sun is 15 years ahead of the temperature. The temperature decrease is just starting.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank Numidious for accepting this debate. I. The Universe and Global WarmingThe current state of the Galaxy and our Sun is affecting our temperatures.I.i. The Rest of the Solar SystemThe Sun clearly is in a warmer phase, because all of the other planets have increasing temperatures as well. 'In 2005 data from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor and Odyssey missions revealed that the carbon dioxide 'ice caps' near Mars's south pole had been diminishing for three summers in a row.Habibullo Abdussamatov, head of space research at St. Petersburg's Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory in Russia, says the Mars data is evidence that the current global warming on Earth is being caused by changes in the sun.'[1]''Global warming on Neptune's moon Triton as well as Jupiter and Pluto, and now Mars has some [scientists] scratching their heads over what could possibly be in common with the warming of all these planets … Could there be something in common with all the planets in our solar system that might cause them all to warm at the same time?''[2] Two things can be drawn from this. One, that if other planets are warming, that it is only natural for the Earth to be warming as well. And second, that even if all these planets did have natural causes, then that is a sign of Earth's natural climatic change, instead of man-made. I.ii. The Position of the Milky Way GalaxyEvery approximately 135 million years, Earth enters a more populated area of the Milky Way, and as a result, more cosmic rays hit the Earth, which causes cooling. Currently, we are in a less populated area of the Milky Way, which means that less of these cosmic rays will be hitting the Earth, which means less cloud formation, and of course, warming. [3] for the source on this hypothesis. The sun can also cause this through evaporation.II. Earthly CausesThere are many internal causes of Global Warming as well. II.i. Ocean Current Anomalies Ocean temperature anomalies seem to be rising-along with the temperature. '...one can model past temperatures as a linear trend (that started well before CO2 was added in any substantial quantity) and periodic bumps... ...temperatures over the last 100+ years look a lot like a linear trend plus ocean cycle-driven bumps'[4] What is causing all the bumps?:  [4]  As shown in the graph, the PDO, or ocean currents, temperature has affected the average Earth's temperature.    II.ii. Clouds: A Continuation of Point I.ii.I mentioned about the position of the Milky Way Galaxy and the Sun in regards to these 'cosmic rays'. Here is a more in depth look at the effects of position. 'The implications, if true, had potentially enormous implications for the debate about natural causes of warming. When the sun is very active, it can be thought of as pushing away cosmic rays from the Earth, reducing their incidence. When the sun is less active, we see more cosmic rays. This is fairly well understood. But if Svensmark was correct, it would mean that periods of high solar output should coincide with reduced cloud formation (due to reduced cosmic race incidence), which in turn would have awarming effect on the Earth, since less sunlight would be reflected back into space before hitting the Earth.Here was a theory, then, that would increase the theoretical impact on climate of an active sun, and better explain why solar irradiance changes might be underestimating the effect of solar output changes on climate and temperatures.'[4]'Since he first suggested his hypothesis over a decade and a half ago, Svensmark and other researchers have slowly been putting together research to test it.' The results were: 'Scientists found that when shielding was removed and natural cosmic rays allowed to hit the chamber, cloud seeding increased dramatically, and it increased substantially again when additional artificial cosmic rays were added. Svensmark appears to have gotten it right.'[5] Proof here is in the next points. III. The 1500-Year Cycle This has to do with a cycle of the climate that can explain the warming. 'Through at least the last million years, a moderate 1500-year warm-cold cycle has been superimposed over the longer, stronger Ice Ages and warm interglacials.'[6]  Here is a graph related to this: [7]There are two things we can conclude from this graph. First, that up-and-down cycles are normal for the long-term climate. This century's global warming is nothing new. The second thing we can conclude, is that today's global warming is not as bad as the Medieval Warm Period's peak yet, and the Medieval Warm Period was less than the Holocene Maximum Period.    'Even more important, the earth is not 'the warmest it has ever been.' In fact, the earth was much warmer during the Medieval Warm Period when human agriculture flourished!'[7]'The scientists found evidence that on average, every 1,470 years, plus or minus 500 years, cold, ice-bearing waters, which today circulate around southern Greenland, pushed as far south as Great Britain.'[8] There seems to be a full cycle of up-down-up temperatures of the climate every 1470 years. And this goes as far back as at least 1 million years ago. Currently, we are in an upswing of temperatures, just coming off of the Little Ice Age, the peak to be in a few hundred years, making the peak-to-peak difference between today's global warming and the Medieval Warm Period a little less than 1500 years. So today's Global Warming is a natural, cyclical occurence.    IV. The Sun: The Proof of Theories I.ii and II.iiThe sun's cycles have a lot to do with temperatures also.  'In this chamber, 63 CERN scientists from 17 European and American institutes have done what global warming doomsayers said could never be done — demonstrate that cosmic rays promote the formation of molecules that in Earth’s atmosphere can grow and seed clouds, the cloudier and thus cooler it will be. Because the sun’s magnetic field controls how many cosmic rays reach Earth’s atmosphere (the stronger the sun’s magnetic field, the more it shields Earth from incoming cosmic rays from space), the sun determines the temperature on Earth.'[9]'Svensmark matched the data on cosmic rays from the neutron monitor in Climax, Colorado, with the satellite measurements of solar irradiance from 1970 to 1990. Over the period between 1975 and 1989, he found cosmic rays decreased by 1.2 percent annually, amplifying the sun's change in irradiance about four-fold'[6]So, as the sun's activity increases, so does the temperature. This below graph shows the correlation: [10] This graph clearly shows that temperature goes up and down with solar activity, because an increase in solar activity directly correlates with an increase in average temperature 1-2 years later. And as a final side note, I would like to present this graph that helps disprove the anthropogenic cause theory, regarding again, ocean temperature anomalies: [4]So 'nature' created the same temperature trend as 'humans' did. </t>

    <t>Hello again, I appreciate my opponent's commitment also. The debate has been interesting, if long. Unfortunately my last response was somewhat incoherent towards the end - this is because it was written at a time when I should have been asleep...I. Find the Gases that Causes the Planet to Warm I am glad that my opponent does not refute this. However, what my opponent must mean by agreeing with it is that the greenhouse effect actually exists, as I explained. If the greenhouse effect exists, then enhancement of that effect must warm the planet! My opponent states later that 'carbon dioxide does not correlate with temperature very well,' but it must if he agree with these statements.II. Ensure that those Gases Enter and Remain in the Atmosphere in Greater (or Lesser) Quantities than Beforei. Methane I agree that, relative to the natural amount of methane entering the atmosphere, the human contribution is fairly small (20%). What my opponent does not realize is that this small change can have MASSIVE effects - the CO2 and Methane (and water vapour) that are in and are cycling through our atmosphere now have been keeping the planet warm for ages, and thank goodness for that as otherwise the average temperature on earth would have been at -18 degrees celsius, that's zero degrees fahrenheit for you Americans, otherwise known as enough for the surface of the planet to be solid ice!Now we know the effects of the amount we already have (from -18 to 14, or 0 to 57 in fahrenheit) just imagine what a slight, minor increase will do... Keeping in mind that the difference between now and the last ice age is just 5 degrees celsius, that's 10 fahrenheit.Methane warms the world '20 times faster than CO2' (1) and although it is only at 1/200th of the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere (and the increase is proportional to this) that still makes methane emissions responsible for 28% of current warming.My opponent's graph is correct, saying that in 2004 methane emissions were going down. Does that preclude the idea that methane caused warming in the years before 2004, or will again? The argument is fallacious in and of itself. Also, AFTER 2004 methane emissions began to increase again, shown here. This may be because methane was trapped in arctic ice, melted by global warming. A fact, by the way, that my opponent cannot dispute - to say that global warming is not happening wrecks his own arguments, to say that there is no natural gas/methane in arctic sea ice is to contradict accepted science.II.ii. CFCsOnce more my opponent asserts that because something will not happen in the future means that it is not happening in the present or did not happen in the past. CFCs, which are entirely human synthesized, are no longer in use. This is, as I mentioned earlier, a success. Since CFCs never had the chance to warm the planet too much (though they certainly damaged the ozone layer) I added them as an afterthought on how humans are capable of changing our planet.II.iii. Nitrous OxideMy opponent's reply here is similar to his on methane, and I give a similar response - small changes in the environment can have massive effects, and my evidence is the same as well - the temperature the planet would be at without the greenhouse effect. Nitrous oxide is particularly interesting in this case because it traps heat 300x as fast as carbon dioxide. This is a phenomenal amount, but since much less nitrous oxide ends up in the atmosphere every year than carbon dioxide, it remains a lesser contributor to warming.  My opponent asserts that cows reduce nitrous oxide in the atmosphere - but by how much? The reference my opponent provided was inconclusive at best.  iv. Carbon Dioxide  My opponent's assertion here that the troposphere is not warming is, unfortunately, incorrect, as this graph should exemplify.According to Science Daily, 'The troposphere, the lower part of the atmosphere closest to the Earth, is warming and this warming is broadly consistent with both theoretical expectations and climate models, according to a new scientific study that reviews the history of understanding of temperature changes and their causes in this key atmospheric layer.'My opponent claims that his graph 'disproves the greenhouse theory' but does not recognize that the natural greenhouse effect has been warming the planet for thousands of years - he is welcome to suggest that CO2 could come from another source than humans, but to say that the greenhouse effect does not exist contradicts this (5) this (6) and this (7) and many, many other sources. In fact, the greenhouse effect itself was known to be true long before global warming, in 1824 when Joseph Fourier first expained it. You have to wonder, where else would all the CO2 go? It doesn't just disappear!My opponent is self contradictory here, as in the same argument he concurs that carbon dioxide and other gases warm the atmosphere but denies that the greenhouse effect they create exists, and furthermore denies that adding any MORE carbon dioxide would warm the atmosphere to a greater extent!If one is to study my opponent's graph here more closely, one realizes that the ppm of carbon dioxide is increasing on this graph, and quite alarmingly. In a mere 30 years it increased by 30 ppm in our entire atmosphere! This is very alarming, especially considering what I mentioned earlier, the fact that the natural amount of ppm of carbon in our atmosphere has warmed the earth 60 degrees fahrenheit and 30 celsius! I repeat again as well that the difference between now and the last ice age was 6 degrees. Thus the temperature and the ppm shown here ARE correlated, and in a very alarming way.The next graph presented is in fact a clever trick - it focus only on minor temperature changes and not on the larger picture it merely sets the information so that the lines fit. It is true, as I have mentioned that the sun causes short term variations in temperature. However, here is a graph that shows OVERALL temperatures, and thus the long term correlation between CO2 and temperature. The next piece here (A 'cooling' arctic) is simply incorrect. I can show you better than explain, but here are a few quotes anyhow.'Since 1951 the arctic has warmed twice as much as the global average' (9)'The temperature in the arctic has gone up 1.5 degrees celsius, whereas the world has gone up 0.7 degrees.''Arctic's rapid temperature rise breaks records.' (10)'Last year NASA released reports showing arctic temperatures going beyond 2010 records.' (11)For my opponent's final point, he says that global warming causes rises in CO2 levels. How? The greenhouse effect has been established, and accepted by my opponent. If CO2 levels are a a lagging indicator, then how are 1960 - 1990 on these graphs explained?II.iv. Water VapourWhat my opponent does not realize here is that temperature rises cause water vapour to increase! Therefore a 1 degree celsius rise in temperature from CO2 causes a 3 degree rise from water vapour - thermal expansion means more water evaporates.No more space - one last graph.This explains the speed of current warming best.</t>

    <t>I am here going to prove to the audience and to my opposition that global warming is primarily caused by homo sapiens and is thus a characteristic of the anthropocene - a term recently created by geologists to express 'the age of man.' I have yet to thorougly read my opponent's arguments, so anything that I write that may seem to be a rebuttal is pure coincidence. I thank my opponent for challenging me to this debate and hope for an interesting exchange of ideas. Either he'll learn something or I will!Three Steps to Damaging the Planet (Human Style)A) Find the gases that cause the planet to warmThe following gases contribute to the greenhouse effect...(10)Feedback GasesWATER VAPOURWater vapour is a 'feedback' to the climate rather than a cause of climate change. It is a greenhouse gas, but it does not contribute to a change in the greenhouse effect, rather, it changes with the temperature of the atmosphere, and thus acts as a way of telling if we're doing things right. Put simply, we on earth can't directly affect the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere, but more of it should tell us that the temperature of the planet is warming (because it evaporates. We can't heat the oceans by ourselves so we need something less direct.) and thus there's a cause - effect relationship - more CO2/Methane/etc. = Higher Temperaures = More Water VapourCausal GasesMETHANENot what you were expecting, right? But still very important. Most mammals have natural methane emissions of a kind, and this can change, so this will go into our recipe for messing with our climate. Naturally, however, it is emitted at 270 teragrams per year (9) Come back to this later.NITROUS OXIDEAlso causal to rather than resulting from a change in climate, that is, we can change how much goes into the atmosphere.CFCsThe same ones that destroy the ozone layer, this time, they're back to destroy the biosphere. I say 'destroy' because CFCs are as irrefutably man - made as CO2 and Methane are not, and therefore MUST be at least one reason that the atmosphere is warming. (Since they are artificial, to say that an increase in their quantity has non - anthropogenic causes would be like saying that trees can be made of plastic).CARBON DIOXIDEThe classic greenhouse gas. Carbon dioxide is absorbed to some extent in grass and trees (photosynthesis) on a natural level, and otherwise may be released through volcanoe and major forest fires, or the combustion of organic material. This usually accounts for 750 gigatons (8) of CO2 moving through the carbon cycle every year, not including human intervention.The gases listed here under causal warm the earth through the greenhouse effect. This is not controversial, here's how it works(7)The greenhouse effect, WITHOUT human intervention (except obviously in CFCs), is caused by the above gases in the above way. Now all we have to do is add a greedy, unenlightened species and we're on our way...B) Ensure that those gases enter and remain in the atmosphere in greater (or lesser) quantities than beforeMETHANEHumans add 330 teragrams per year (9) of methane to the atmosphere every year to the 270 teragrams already entering it, mostly through methane emitted by livestock (a single modern cow emits 270 kg of methane each year), from decay in landfills and from waste treatment, not to mention the burning of biomass. If the 330 teragrams going into the atmosphere WITHOUT humans every year causes 9% of the greenhouse effect, as noted above, then that amount doubling will, of course, ENHANCE the greenhouse effect, causing - global warming. The truth is that it would be strange if it DIDN'T. There are now 2 billion cows on the planet, far more than at any point in history. They, through methane emissions, are enhancing the greenhouse effect.CARBON DIOXIDEIt has been mentioned that 750 gigatons goes through the carbon cycle every year. Humans add 29 gigatons (8) - haha, the opposition says, the amount of human emissions of CO2 every year pale in compare to how much goes through the carbon cycle! But then one takes closer look - every year, 439 gigatons are released and 450 are absorbed by plants and trees. Suddenly, the 29 gigatons becomes much more frightening, especially when one observes that carbon dioxide is now at 390 ppm (parts per million) in the atmosphere, nearly twice as high as it has been for the last 500,000 years! The higher amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is also caused, of course, by the fact that our conversion of land for agriculture has led to land with plants that absorb less CO2 (virtually all my references will say this) so that the number of gigatons absorbed (450) is decreasing whilst the 29 is increasing, resulting in idle CO2 sitting around, warming up the atmosphere - as it must as a greenhouse gas.CO2 is poisonous as well, by the way, so even if my worthy opponent and/or audience leaves this debate with their minds unchanged on the topic of anthropogenic global warming, remember that there is still reason for CO2 emissions to be curtailed!CFCsThis is an optimistic part of the human - greenhouse effect story in that we actually stopped putting CFCs into the atmosphere when we realized how awful they were for the ozone layer. Therefore we do not put CFCs into the atmosphere any more - it's like a defunct greenhouse gas, in retirement.NITROUS OXIDENO2 has an atmospheric lifetime of 121 years (11) so naturally even a small amount of nitrous coming out of your exhaust enhances global warming for years to come. And when it's 110 to 240 thousand tonnes coming from car exhaust pipes every year, you know you have a problem. Add 2 to 4 million tonnes from fertilization practices in agriculture and you have a MAJOR problem! Add to this the fact that NO2 is 310 times as powerful as CO2 as a greenhouse gas and you have a full blown nightmare.Given the endless facts and evidence presented above, it would be strange if the atmosphere was NOT warming up from human intervention. The below only affirms what should be evident. On to our third and final step.C) Watch as the planet warms or cools six degrees, the difference between now and the last ice ageIt is often mentioned that the earth's climate has change in the past, and that is most assuredly true. It is also true, of course, that the earth's climate can change in the future, and for different reasons. However, what is unique about the warming of the anthropocene is that it has happened and is happening so suddenly, more suddenly than in the past. The closest example of climate change at this speed (just 120 years since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution), obviously excluding the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs, is the Palaeo - Eocene Thermal Maximum (13) about 55 million years ago, when the climate changed 5 to 8 degrees,that warming, of course, took several thousand years.</t>
<h>    It is a greenhouse gas, rather, it changes with the temperature of the atmosphere, and thus acts as a way of telling if we're doing things right.</h>

    <t>Interesting points, Ron-Paul. Sorry for leaving the debate to the last minute, I've been rather busy of late. Thanks for taking all this time to type out a response.I. The current state of the galaxy AND the sun? That is very unusual, since they are not necessarily correlate.I.i. The Rest of the Solar SystemIt is interesting that Mars is brought up here, a planet that we don't really have information for before 1970 and that we are only scratching the surface on in terms of dust storms and their planetary effects etc. but let's look at the argument...'carbon dioxide 'ice caps' near Mars's south pole had been diminishing for three summers in a row.' Three years? How does one infer warming from this? However, I shall quote a climate science website...'This is essentially due to large scale dust storms that were common back then (1977), compared to a lower level of storminess now. The mean temperature on Mars, averaged over the Martian year can change by many degrees from year to year, depending on how active large scale dust storms are.' Thus the cause of the three - year - melting in ice caps? Dust storms, which, by the way, act like Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere.There has been no direct observation of global warming on Triton. There has been an observance of greater luminosity, but that is because Neptune does have changes (those causing Triton to seem brighter) but they are seasonal as well - a year on Neptune is 165 years on earth. Neptune is entering it's Summer.As for Jupiter, it is not warming at all. Predictions say it will warm because of storm and dust movements, not because of solar radiation. As for Pluto, we can go back to Neptune. Pluto's orbit is 248 earth years - this is like observing earth for three weeks. How do we know where it is on it's orbit? A probe has never even actually been sent to Pluto! I.ii.I agree that less cosmic rays will be hitting the earth. However, the connection between cosmic rays and cloud cover is uncertain, and, more importantly in this argument, cosmic rays do not correlate with temperature AFTER 1994 - so really this could be an argument that global warming DOES have human causes, because, as this chart shows, temperatures have gone up dramatically where cosmic rays have gone down only slightly of late.(7)II.Humans, of course, are the main internal cause of global warming!II.i.It is impossible for an ocean oscillation to create or retain heat of it's own. It merely circulates heat throughout the atmosphere and oceans, (5) which is why the atmosphere becomes warmer at some points. If you think about it, anything else would be ludicrous - currents CAUSE heat? Impossible. There are short term effects of heating in the atmosphere (and cooling) from the circulation, but what this chart shows (5) is how these circulations differ from actual changes in heat.II.ii.I refer the audience to my earlier graph, which suggests that there is no causal effect between cosmic rays and global warming over the long term. I also refer my audience to four studies that were conducted on the subject after Svensmark's 1998.... These conclude that'no statistically significant correlations were found between any of the four cloud parameters and GCR'- Kristjansson et al. (2008)'no response of global cloud cover to Forbush decreases at any altitude and latitude.' - Calogovic et al. (2010)''galactic cosmic rays appear to play a minor role for atmospheric aerosol formation events, and so for the connected aerosol-climate effects as well.' Kulmala et al. (2010)What my graph here shows is that the third (and most recent of all four studies, including my opponent's) premise would seem to be correct.III.Interestingly, the opposition's graph only goes back 1000 years. To give the audience a more holistic picture, here is one of five year averages in the northern hemisphere going back to 0 CE.What is important to take into account here is that the sun does indeed affect earth's temperature, but in different ways and at different times, and in greater amounts of time than of late. My opposition says that the Medieval Warming Period was warmer than today, however, this is not so. The misinterpretation of data is a result of the restrictedness of the data - most of it was taken in the North Atlantic and Greenland, where various forms of paleoatmospheric research show that it was indeed much warmer today. HOWEVER, in the tropical Pacific it was much cooler than today. Overall, as my graph has shown, we have reached global temperatures that are on average MUCH warmer than the averages of the Medieval Warming period!And here is another graph similar to that of my opponent but more specific....Different colours showing different areas/forms of evidence from a variety of sources.All in all what I am saying here is that in 1950 my opposition could have seemed quite correct in his graphing, with perhaps a few discrepancies concerning the rapidity of temperature increase. However, it has CONTINUED to warm, and this is what is worrying to scientists. It continues to warm to the point that, if it should continue at current rates, the earthly survival of plants and animals may be threatened.IV.Another used - to - be - true argument. Once more, this graph shows that over the past several decades, temperature and solar activity have gone in opposite directions. Why is this? Because of the anthropogenic effect. Note that this following graph deals with WORLD temperatures rather than US specific, which are neither accurate nor credible as evidence of global climate as a whole. (Different places on earth experience different warmings/coolings at different times.V.This point is, I believe, backed by flawed logic - both are cases of warming, but with different causes. If a logger pull out an axe and chops down a tree, then points to a tree that fell naturally and says 'the tree that I just chopped down fell naturally because it looks the same as the other one' would you believe the logger's 'logic' or would you believe what you saw with your own eyes?There would seem to be many poins here that are not correlated (thus making them all true to be more unlikely) and many that do not seem to be backed by credible research. There have been many causes of warming on a global level in the past, humans are just another. And we are a natural cause because, contrary to what blind followers of the religion that externalities to short term profits do not exist, governments, businesses, and individuals are fallible and can cause problems on an environmental scale.However, I appreciate my opponent's points and look forward to reading his criticisms of mine.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank my opponent for presenting his arguments. I. Find the Gases that Causes the Planet to Warm My opponent here is just presenting the different gases. This is an observation, not an argument. We will differ when anthropogenic arguments are presented. II. Ensure that those Gases Enter and Remain in the Atmosphere in Greater (or Lesser) Quantities than BeforeII.i. Methane Human contribution to methane concentrations is actually rather small:  [1]And even if human causation was the main factor of methane concentrations, the amount of methane increase has actually been decreasing, and is now decreasing:[2]Notice that during the infamous 'hockey stick' (I will get to that later) times, methane increases were actually decreasing. So, not only are humans relatively small causes of methane concentrations, but methane amounts are actaully decreasing at this point. II.ii. CFCs Even though CFCs are mostly man-made in origin, there concentrations have been decreasing also: [3]Again, just like methane amounts, during the main warming times, CFCs concentration increases were decreasing, and are now negative. II.iii. Nitrous Oxide As with methane, human contributions to nitrous oxide are very small:[1]In fact, ocean amoeba are a major cause of nitrous oxide: 'Dr Trimmer looked at nitrous oxide production in the Arabian Sea, which accounts for up to 18 % of global ocean emissions. He found that the gas is primarily produced by bacteria trying to make nitrogen gas.'[4] And that is just the Arabian Sea. And even if cows did cause a lot of warming: '...a new study found that cattle grazed on the grasslands of China actually reduce another greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide.'[5] So, humans are positive in this aspect. II.iv. Carbon DioxideThis will be my main point.First, by the greenhouse effect, global warming should be starting from the lower atmosphere and moving to the surface, but this is not happening: '...satellite and high-altitude balloon data confirm that the lower atmosphere is not trapping lots of additional heat due to higher CO2 concentrations. It is hard to know how fast the Earth's highly variable surface is warming, but it is warming faster than the lower atmosphere where the CO2 is accumulating. This is strong evidence that CO2 is not the primary climate factor.'[6]Here is a graph relating to the point, showing the decrease in upper troposphere temperature anomalies, disproving the greenhouse theory here:  [7]Second, CO2 levels do not correlate with temperature very well: 'In the last decade, there has been no clear warming trend (as the UK Met Office and IPCC’s own figures demonstrate). In the last century, much of the warming occurred prior to 1940, when human emissions of CO2 were relatively small compared to today. During the post-war economic boom (when one would have expected the temperature to rise) the world cooled, from the 1940s till the mid-70s (again, this is evident from accepted data used by the IPCC).'[8]Here is a graph showing the fallacy of the CO2-temperature correlation:   [9]As shown, CO2 does not correlate with temperature. This next graph compares solar activity and CO2 to temperature. It is easy to see which one correlates with temperature more:  [10] Third, global warming is not starting at the poles like it should be, by the greenhouse theory. In fact, there has been general, relative cooling: 'If the greenhouse thoery were valid, temperatures in the Arctic and the Antarctic would have risen several degrees Celsius since 1940 due to the huge emissions of man-made CO2... Recently, a team led by the University of Chicago's Peter Doran published a paper in Nature saying, 'Although previous reports suggest recent continental warming, our spatial analysis of Antarctic meteorological data demonstrates a net cooling on the Antarctic continent between 1966 and 2000'. The data from 21 Antarctic surface stations show an average continental decline of 0.008 degrees C from 1978 to 1998, and the infrared data from satellites operating since 1979 show a decline of 0.42 degrees C per decade. David W. J. Thompson of Colorado State University and Susan Soloman of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration also report a cooling trend in the Antarctic interior. ... report that satellite imaging shows increases in Souther Ocean sea ice parameters from 1978 to 1996 and an increase in the length of the sea-ice season in the 1990s'[6]'Greenland has also been growing colder over the last half-century...''... examined the temperatures for the entire Arctic for 1951 to 1990, he [Rajmund Przybylak, Polish climatologist] reported, 'no tangible manifestations of the greenhouse effect [could] be identified'[6]  This graph shows the arctic temperatures. The blue line is the melt point. Clearly, it spends little time there: [11]This graph shows that Antarctic sea ice extent is rising:   [12] Fourth and finally, CO2 is a lagging indicator: '...the CO2 changes have lagged about 800 years behind the temperuatre changes. Global warming has produced more CO2, rather than more CO2 producing global warming.'[6] So, the theory is reversed. CO2 does not cause global warming, but vice versa. II.v. Water Vapor    Believe it or not, the four gases mentioned above actually make up about 5% of all greenhouse gases. The other 95% is natural made water vapor:    [1]So all of the other gases' contribution to global warming is almost negligible compared to water vapor. II.vi. Conclusion   'Just how much of the 'Greenhouse Effect' is caused by human activity?  It is about 0.28%, if water vapor is taken into account-- about 5.53%, if not.'III. Watch as the Planet Warms or Cools Six Degrees, the Difference between Now and the Last Ice Age 'During the last 150 years there has been another fairly sustained period of global warming amounting to an increase of about 0.7 degree Celsius. In spite of rhetoric to the contrary, the majority of this warming took place naturally before 1940. This warming trend was interrupted by a 35-year cooling period from 1940 to 1975. This caused many climatologists to actually predict that we were entering another ice age. At that time the public was obsessed with “global cooling.” Today, our obsession is “global warming.'[13] Still, today's global warming is nothing new, in fact, it is not even that big.</t>

    <t>Global climate change according to me is manmade. Climate change or global warming, according to me, is here as a result of our misdeeds- like deforestation, burning of fossil fuels, emission of carbon dioxide and other harmful greenhouse gases. Forests have the ability to convert carbon dioxide into oxygen and we are removing them, throwing them out of our planet for our own betterment- for land, for fuel, for medicinal purposes and etc. While doing this we, knowingly or unknowingly, cut off the planet's "lungs". So as an answer to our deforestation, mother earth gives us GLOBAL WARMING! Mankind's burning of fossil fuels causes a warming tendency in the atmosphere- global warming. The mainly used fuel coal when burnt releases huge numbers of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere making it unfit to breathe in, and also causing greenhouse effect.It has now been proven that as a result to our blasting millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide has increased the temperature by 4 degree Celsius, since the 1950's. This increase in temperature is because of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (released by our activities) which trap heat and make the earth HOTTER. These greenhouse gases also deplete the ozone layer which protects us from harmful UV rays and the immense heat released by the sun. Now, this depletion has grown to such an extent that we have a hole in the ozone layer resulting in an increasing temperature. With reference to all the points I have mentioned above, I can conclude that GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE (GLOBAL WARMING) IS MANMADE!</t>

    <t>What the historic record shows is that yes, climate change has been occurring since the planet's formation. What it does not show, is the planet abruptly warming in less than a century, at exactly the same time that there is extensive CO2 emissions by an sentient species.  In fact, what most people don't realise is that we are technically still in an ice age that began a few million years ago. Having an ice sheet on an empty polar ocean is unusual compared to Earth's past. However, just because the planet has once had a hotter environment does not mean modern species can live in this environment, or adapt to it.  Anthropogenic Global Warming is a thing.

    <t>I accept the definitions brought forth by the Proposition, however I would like to point out that the definition of 'Sustainable' can be interpreted differently by different people. For the purposes of this debate, I will act under the assumption that 'Sustainable' means the ability for a natural resource to endure. Following this definition, I find that some of my opponent's arguments are off topic and unrelated. Sustainability in this debate refers to the ability for the trees to endure. The loss of animals or plants; though regretted, does not affect the sustainability of the trees.  Furthermore, I am not aware if this is a Policy or Values debate or if those types of debate even exist on Debate.org. Therefore, I would greatly appreciate it if the Proposition cleared that up but I will act under the assumption that this is a Values debate as the Proposition has not already brought forth a plan. I would like to point out some flaws in my opponent's case before I get into my constructive arguments:  In my opponent's first point, he mentioned how the felling of a certain type of tree in a certain area will lead to the decrease of biological diversity. But this is simply not true. It is true that selective logging focuses on a specific type of tree, but not every tree in an area is felled. For example, if loggers decided to log down oak trees they would not cut down every oak tree within a square kilometer. Animals will not lose their food supply as only trees of harvestable size are harvested. Any young tree is left alone to continue the biodiversity and to continue supporting the animals in the region.  My opponent also mentioned plants living the tree that is felled would be damaged and undergrowth would be squashed. However, this is true with any sort of deforestation yet with selective logging the damage is reduced greatly compared to clear cut logging as not every tree is cut down. Furthermore, loggers attempt to guide the tree to the ground, minimizing damage to the undergrowth.  In the second point, my opponent explained how the micro climate would be affected by the logging of certain trees. However, the climate change would be extremely minimal as only certain trees are cut down. Furthermore, after logging loggers generally will reforest the trees that they have logged down with the same species of tree providing more canopies to minimize climate change.  Finally, my opponent mentioned the destruction caused by the building of roads. However, the construction of roads is prohibited in National Forests. There are various other ways of transporting felled logs out of an area that does not harm the environment in a serious way. For example, heli-logging uses helicopters to vertically lift the log out of an area.  My opponent has also mentioned that areas that have been previously selectively logged have a higher chance of being logged in the future. However, that is the purpose of reforestation and selective logging and I will be getting more into this point in my constructive arguments.  I would also like to point out that while selective logging is not perfect; it is a far better option than other forms of logging and far more sustainable. Though selective logging may remove an area the size of Connecticut, but clear-cutting would remove an area many times greater.  I will now continue on to my first contention, which is that the main factor influencing selective logging's ability to be sustainable is the logging methods and reforestation. I will present my second, third, and fourth contention in the respective rounds.  Loggers are aware of the environmental damage caused by clear-cut logging. That is why selective-logging was created. The idea is that some of the trees that are suitable for logging will be logged and the younger trees will remain untouched. The purpose of this is for those young trees to grow into the large trees that were cut down. This way, after several years the loggers can return to cut down those younger trees that weren't cut before. Once again, they don't touch the younger trees. Several years later, these loggers return. This cycle continues, ensuring a sustainable source of trees. We can compare the trees to the life cycle of a human. In the forest, there are middle-aged trees, young adult trees, and then teenage trees. The middle-aged are removed and new babies are inserted. The young adults grow into the middle-aged, the teenage grow into the young adults, and the babies grow into teenagers. The middle-aged are removed…  Not only that, but reforestation efforts are increasing. New saplings are planted in the areas that have been logged already, thus the cycle becomes continuous. Brazil projects to have reforested 1 billion trees by the year 2013. Thus, we will have near limitless supplies of trees, clearly a living embodiment of the term 'Sustainable'. So what have we learned today? We learned that through logging and reforestation, we can achieve a balance between the rates of logging and the rates of growth in young trees.

    <t>For a very long time, selective logging has been cited as an environmentally friendly alternative to clear cutting. However, increasing evidence is revealing that this is not the case. As such, I would like to instigate a debate on this matter.  The first round is for acceptance as well as some arguments. The second, third and fourth rounds are for arguments and rebuttals. The final round is for drawing a conclusion.  Definitions: Selective logging - The practice of removing only certain desired trees in an area, leaving the rest intact. Clear cutting - The practice of removing all trees in an area, selecting the appropriate wood afterwards. Sustainable - 'Our Common Future' definition Deforestation - the land use conversion of a plot of land from a forest to other uses.  Let me now begin my arguments.  Firstly, selective logging affects surrounding organisms. When trees are cut down, plants such as vines, lianas, strangler figs and parasites which rely on the felled tree will have to go as well. Moreover, felled trees will damage surrounding trees, as well as the undergrowth. (1) This reduces the biomass of the forest.  If only trees of a certain species are targeted, their disappearance in that area will lead to a decrease on the biodiversity of the area. Many animals species in forests rely on a scarce food supply and the disappearance of one species of trees may cut off their main food supply. (1) The energy flow of the rainforest will be disrupted and lower in complexity. The resilience stability of the rainforest is lowered.  Secondly, selective logging affects the microclimate of the clearing. The canopy prevents radiation loss, increases relative humidity and lowers wind speed. Without the canopy layer, sunlight can penetrate directly to the forest floor in the daytime, and heat loss will be faster at night. The diurnal range of temperature will be enlarged. The alteration of the habitat will render the clearing uninhabitable to the original inhabitants. At the same time, species that were originally unable to inhabit the area will invade the forest. For example, as the sunlight can reach the ground directly, the undergrowth will become much thicker. This change in ecosystem disrupts the ecological balance and pushes the ecosystem away from a state of equilibrium. (1)  Direct exposure of the soil to sunlight also causes dries up the soil. The loss of litter also intensifies the rainsplash effect and leads to soil erosion in the clearing. The hydrological cycle is damaged as evapotranspiration is reduced and the soil water content is lowered. (1) Studies have shown that selectively logged forests are more prone to droughts and fires even after years of regeneration. (3)  Thirdly, roads created will bring massive damage to the forest. Roads divide the forest into many segments, which affects the migration of animals. Many species of animals can only live along the margins of forests. (1) As the number of roads increases, these animals can breed at a faster rate than is normally allowed as they can also live along the roads. In fact, many logging companies use the increasing numbers of such species to 'prove' that they are not harming the environment. (4) However, this phenomenon is very destructive as the overbreeding of animals used to forest fringes and the depletion of those who prefer the interior will lower the biodiversity and the ecological integrity of the forest. (1)  Perhaps most importantly, the introduction of roads improves the accessibility of the rainforest, thereby encouraging further exploitation of the forest. Many equatorial regions are rich in rainforest resources. These countries are usually poor. Unemployed and homeless people can follow the roads left behind from selective logging and open up the forest to live and cultivate there. (1) Roads also favour clear-cutting. For example, a 2006 study showed that selective logging increases the likelihood of forests being cleared at a later date. 16% of the selectively logged forests are cleared in a year, and a further 5.4% each subsequent year for another four years. (3)  Finally, selective logging itself causes the logging of a giant number of trees. Every year, selective logging in the Brazilian Amazon clears an area of rainforest equivalent to the size of Connecticut. (2)  Despite the many benefits it is thought to bring, selective logging is only the lesser of two evils - and one that will lead to the greater evil too. It is not good news for the biomes which contain half of our world's species among them.

    <t>Thank you, iwillannoyo, for accepting the debate.  Firstly, let me post the 'Our Common Future' definition of 'sustainable' lest my opponent should have any difficulty finding it.  'Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.'  In other words, sustainable development refers not only to the sustainability of trees, but also of the forest ecosystem, its energy flow, nutrient cycle, ecological pyramids, and such. In addition to environmental concerns, sustainability must also take into account social and economic sustainability.  Let me then refute my opponent's counter-arguments.  Firstly, even though the loggers only cut down the stronger and older trees, the removal of such trees reduces the genetic diversity of that type of tree within the area. Furthermore, as these trees have better genes than the weak ones that are left uncut, the stronger genes are removed from the gene pool. This means the existence of this type of tree in the area is more vulnerable than before. Moreover, since only weaker and younger trees are left in the area, the animals which rely on the trees for food will lose a major portion of their food supply.  Secondly, because of the continuous nature of the canopy, felled trees, especially taller trees (i.e. emergents and canopy trees), inevitably damage surrounding trees, even with techniques such as directional tree felling. It is estimated that for every tree logged, thirty are hurt. Furthermore, the stability of the trees are lowered as the networks of vines are disrupted. (2)  In response to the fact that loggers sometimes reforest the trees after logging, forests after selective logging are generally unable to regenerate quickly because trees need a lot of sunlight to regrow. A large, open area where all of the sunlight can reach the ground directly is more favourable for regrowth. Moreover, loggers often do not wait enough time for the trees to grow again. The loggers of the Amazon are one such example. (3) This shows that economic and environmental sustainability conflict when it comes to selective logging. Also, machinery involved in logging always damages trees. (1 and 2) Studies have also shown that selectively logged areas are more susceptible to forest fires. (5)  Although it is against the law to construct roads in national forests, anti-logging laws are often not carried out because of various reasons, including collusion between the government and corporations, bribery and corruption, and lack of manpower. The Brazil Environmental Protection Agency, for example, only collects 6.5% of the fines it imposes. Moreover, every inspector in Brazil has to look after 41 000 square kilometres of forest. Therefore, it is difficult to monitor logging activities. (1) Even in democratic countries such as the United States, collusion between the private sector and government officials is a serious problem. Moreover, multinational corporations from the United States, Britain, France, Belgium and Japan often try to control government officials of developing countries in order to log illegally. (4)  I will not refute the constructive arguments put forward by my opponent because I believe I have sufficiently addressed these points in the arguments above.</t>

    <t>Global climate change according to me is manmade. Climate change or global warming, according to me, is here as a result of our misdeeds- like deforestation, burning of fossil fuels, emission of carbon dioxide and other harmful greenhouse gases. Forests have the ability to convert carbon dioxide into oxygen and we are removing them, throwing them out of our planet for our own betterment- for land, for fuel, for medicinal purposes and etc. While doing this we, knowingly or unknowingly, cut off the planet's "lungs". So as an answer to our deforestation, mother earth gives us GLOBAL WARMING! Mankind's burning of fossil fuels causes a warming tendency in the atmosphere- global warming. The mainly used fuel coal when burnt releases huge numbers of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere making it unfit to breathe in, and also causing greenhouse effect.It has now been proven that as a result to our blasting millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide has increased the temperature by 4 degree Celsius, since the 1950's. This increase in temperature is because of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (released by our activities) which trap heat and make the earth HOTTER. These greenhouse gases also deplete the ozone layer which protects us from harmful UV rays and the immense heat released by the sun. Now, this depletion has grown to such an extent that we have a hole in the ozone layer resulting in an increasing temperature. With reference to all the points I have mentioned above, I can conclude that GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE (GLOBAL WARMING) IS MANMADE!</t>

My first point is the irrefutable fact that climate change has occured before in history with no relation to humans and is sure to occure again. This is a point that all scientists agree with. There has been several periods of 'global warming' in our earth's history, namely the entire Jurassic period and the period in human history known as the middle ages, where the climate has been shown to have gone through similar motions as it is doing now. There was no human effect to cause this, it is merely a part of the natural rhythm of our planet. What is happening now is a stage in the rhythm of our planet that has been blown out of proportion by fear-mongering scientists and hippies.

    <t>I. Greenhouse gasYou cant concede a observation, it is not an argument they are generally fact. We agree on what it is, but what it does. II. The greenhouse effect Before I refute the graph, I would like to note the graph STILL PROVES MY POINT. It may look convincing, as we see a scary increase. But this is actually false. I wish everyone to read the graph. It shows, as I argued, 380 ppm. Yes, as I argued. Hence even with the scary graph, my opponents argument still fails as I refer to last rounds 1.6/100,000 analogy. My opponents graph fails to prove his point. My opponent then produces a quote, which again seems scary. Lets look at the facts. First, one has to prove a significant correlation with temperature and CO2, which never has happened. The correlation is weak, and the correlation is very short (last century). Further, correlation does not equal causation, something my opponent has brushed over many times. Also, the last few hundred years are the only correlation they can gather up, and there is none. My opponents quote only works if they find a correlation for thousands of years, but there is NONE. Further, my opponent forgets CO2 may cause COOLING. Yes, cooling. This says it better then I can: 'Carbon dioxide is a powerful aerial fertilizer, directly enhancing the growth of almost all terrestrial plants and many aquatic plants as its atmospheric concentration rises. And just as increased algal productivity at sea increases the emission of sulfur gases to the atmosphere, ultimately leading to more and brighter clouds over the world's oceans, so too do CO2-induced increases in terrestrial plant productivity lead to enhanced emissions of various sulfur gases over land, where they likewise ultimately cool the planet. In addition, many non-sulfur-based biogenic materials of the terrestrial environment play major roles as water- and ice-nucleating aerosols; and the airborne presence of these materials should also be enhanced by rising levels of atmospheric CO2. Hence, it is possible that incorporation of this multifaceted CO2-induced cooling effect into the suite of equations that comprise the current generation of global climate models might actually tip the climatic scales in favor of global cooling in the face of continued growth of anthropogenic CO2 emissions.'[1]My opponent then cites a graph again to show humans make most of the CO2, well I will cite another graph:Natural made CO2 - 3.502% Man made - 0.117% (based on concentrations, the graph is not based on concentrations)[2] My opponents soruce for this is nasa, not to be rude but nasa? Way to find a bias source. They source the IPCC, political funded motivated etc. And again, many non bias eer reviewed studies actually prove (as well as canadian government estimates) the same data I am finding. [2] III. 'Proof'Pretty much drops my line of argunmentation. Further, he has still filed to find correlation, cause he cant. As I have nothing to refute here, here are graphs:Short term - No correlation. CO2 rises, tempertures begin to fall?Long term:http://www.geocraft.com... (note this graph shows millions of years, and there has been only a rise in CO2 recently, but still a downward trend, temperturs doing their ups and downs)No correlation, either. My oppoent fails on all accounts. Cycles:Mentioned above? Look at the fact I have been spewing. http://www.isil.org...**Note older cycles are warmer then today without CO2 from human causes**GH theoryMy opponent quotes, as will I:'Over 95% of the greenhouse effect is the result of water vapor in Earth's atmosphere. But because water droplets held in suspension (clouds) make almost as good a reflector as they do a thermal insulator, there is little rise in daytime temperatures due to the greenhouse effect. '[3]source 2Why is it like this? water vapor = most abundant and most powerful. Note, water vapor is 99.999% natural. [2]source 2CONCLUSION:My responses seem short, but I think m graphs do the talking, a picture is worth 1000 words. Before anyoen votes on this debate, I recomend the re look II on pros 'proof' this round. Problems with my opponents case:a) he finds no current or long term correlation of CO2 and temperture [I did both]b) forgets water vapor is the most powerful and abundant greenhouse gas, and is 99.999% naturalc) forgets the influenc of the PDO ocean cycles in temperture.

    <t>I want to thank you for allowing me to debate this.I. What is a greenhouse gas? A greenhouse gas is a gas that traps heat in the atmosphere that prevents the head from escaping the earth.[1] There are several gasses that are commonly called 'greenhouse gas' such as: [2]   Carbon Dioxide (CO2): Carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels (oil, natural gas, and coal), solid waste, trees and wood products, and also as a result of other chemical reactions (e.g., manufacture of cement). Carbon dioxide is also removed from the atmosphere (or “sequestered”) when it is absorbed by plants as part of the biological carbon cycle. Methane (CH4): Methane is emitted during the production and transport of coal, natural gas, and oil. Methane emissions also result from livestock and other agricultural practices and by the decay of organic waste in municipal solid waste landfills. Nitrous Oxide (N2O): Nitrous oxide is emitted during agricultural and industrial activities, as well as during combustion of fossil fuels and solid waste. Fluorinated Gases: Hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride are synthetic, powerful greenhouse gases that are emitted from a variety of industrial processes. Fluorinated gases are sometimes used as substitutes for ozone-depleting substances (i.e., CFCs, HCFCs, and halons). These gases are typically emitted in smaller quantities, but because they are potent greenhouse gases, they are sometimes referred to as High Global Warming Potential gases (“High GWP gases”).  Of all these, CO2 makes up the vast majority of 56% [3] My partner already defined a CO2 emission so I've no need to go into that. II. What does a greenhouse gas do? A greenhosue gas locks in the heat from the sun causing what is known as a greenhouse effect.  III. Proof that humans are the main cause of global warming I wanted to establish what a greenhouse gas was and how it worked; however, that is not the resolution. We are wanting to know whether or not humans are the main cause. My contention is that global warming is mainly caused by CO2 emissions via human activities. According to the USCS, we know that humans are the cause of global warming for at least 3 reasons (their words in italics): [4] Human fingerprints on Carbon overoad - When humans burn coal, oil, and gas to generate electricity or drive cars, CO2 is released int o the atmosphere, where it traps heat. A carbon molecule that comes from fossil fules and deforestastion is lighter than the combined signals of those from other sources. Natural changes alone cannot explain the temperature changes we've seen - My partner rightfully points out that there is a natural explanation for some of the temperature changes we have seen. However, nature alone cannot account for such changes. For a computer model to accurately project the future climate, scientists must first ensure that it is accurately reproduces the observed temperature changes. However, when the models include only recorded natural climate drivers (i.e., the sun's intensity), the models cannot accurately reproduce the observed warming of the previous 50 years. When human-induced climate drivers are also included in the models, then they accurately capture recent temperature increases in the atmosphere and in the oceans. When all the natural and human-induced climate drivers are compared to one another, the dramatic accumulation of carbon from human sources is by far the largest climate change driver over the past half century. Lower-level atmosphere — which contains the carbon load—is expanding. The boundary between the lower atmosphere (troposphere) and the higher atmosphere (stratosphere) has shifted upward in recent decades. See the ozone FAQ for a figure illustrating the layers of the atmosphere. This boundary has likely changed because heat-trapping gases accumulate in the lower atmosphere and that atmospheric layer expands as it heats up (much like warming the air in a balloon). And because less heat is escaping into the higher atmosphere, it is likely cooling. This differential would not occur if the sun was the sole climate driver, as solar changes would warm both atmospheric layers, and certainly would not have warmed one while cooling the other. ConclusionC1: Natural cycles alone cannot account for the climate change that we observe;C2: CO2 is a main cause of Greenhouse Gas within the Atmosphere.C3: Activities that humans do on a regular basis emit CO2 into the atmosphere contributing to greenhouse gas.Resolution affirmed.</t>

    <t>Natural cycles:This argument is about solar cycles (as well as other cycles). This is one of the more common arguments in the global warming debate. There are many longer solar cycles, but there are sometimes shorter ones (1500 years +/- 500). We are actually in an ice age, but a section called an interglacial. (like a temporary break). This is much of modern history, and in those 15,000 years it seems as though we have perfectly fit into this 1500 year cycle, and the funny thing is we are in the middle of the cycle as we speak. It will soon end, but this warming is expected. Now the significance to this cycle is it perfectly explains global warming, accelerated heating then cooling. [1] This perfectly explains the 'unprecedented' warming. Also:http://www.isil.org... (scroll down about halfway and see graph)Looks like a natural cycle to me, and very predictable. Furthermore:'In 2005 data from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor and Odyssey missions revealed that the carbon dioxide 'ice caps' near Mars's south pole had been diminishing for three summers in a row. Habibullo Abdussamatov, head of space research at St. Petersburg's Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory in Russia, says the Mars data is evidence that the current global warming on Earth is being caused by changes in the sun.' http://news.nationalgeographic.com... Another reason is the earths position in the milky way. Every 135 million years we enter a more populated area in the galaxy and hit more cosmic rays which make clouds, and therefore cooling. Currently we are in a les populated branch, and the less rays mean we will inevitably be warmer/warming. [2] Wind and ocean currents also play a LARGE role in heating/cooling. http://www.climate-skeptic.com...Sums it up. (scroll down to PDO warm and cool) Problems with the greenhouse theoryNow, we (If I decide to argue greenhouse) can attribute warming to other gases, and I still win the debate as I prove it not human CO2 enduced. In this contention I argue water vapor causes much of the warming. Basically to sum up what I would have said in many paragraphs:'However, the most potent greenhouse gas is water, explains Shaidurov and it is this compound on which his study focuses. According to Shaidurov, only small changes in the atmospheric levels of water, in the form of vapour and ice crystals can contribute to significant changes to the temperature of the earth's surface, which far outweighs the effects of carbon dioxide and other gases released by human activities. Just a rise of 1% of water vapour could raise the global average temperature of Earth's surface more then 4 degrees Celsius.'http://phys.org... Also if the theory was true, the north and south polls would be seeing increased meltings and be seeing large temperture spikes. I contend the pols have had little to no warming. I think this observation is common knowlege. More stuff'That means that less than 2/1,000 of all CO2 is produced by human activity. So even if we wiped out every car, power plant, jet liner, and human being from the face of the earth, there would be no noticeable effect on global CO2 levels.'http://www.isil.org... Further if CO2 was a climate factor, if we saw natural increases in CO2 there would also be natural rises in temperature hundreds of years ago, and there is no correlation, therefore the correlation fails on a scientific basis. Using figure 2.4 in source (2) we observe no statistical correlation, CO2 is low temperature may be high or vice versa. This right here disproves the theory. (If CO2 actually had an impact, natural increases would also raise temperature, it did not, hence it has no correlation)..Also CO2 lags temperture. If CO2 was a cause it would happen before the rise, hence even if it is a natural increase we should see an increase in temp, we dont, hence there is no correlation.

    <t>I. What a greenhouse gas isThis is more of an observation rather than a argument. I agree with you on what these emissions are, but differ on if they are the principle cause of global warming. II. The greenhouse effect Now lets first look on how much heat will be forced to stay. CO2 is like a sheet of plastic, it only absorbed 8% of the radiation. So only 8% is temporarily trapped, ok? Only 1% of the things leaving the atmosphere is heat. So based on simple math we can see these small numbers will unlikely be able to create any major 'unprecedented' global warming.And there is more math that makes it seem impossible that CO2 is a factor. I will make this into a quiz like my source 1 does:The percentage of CO2 in the atmosphere is [1]: a) over 10%b) 5-10%c) 1-5%d) less then 1%Any wagers? You guessing c? Its 'd'. Less then 1%. Human contribution to CO2:a) over 20%b) 10-20%c) 5-10%d) less then 5%The answer is 'd' again, in a 2-5% range depending on the stats. Now why is this important and actually crippling to my opponents case? Here is why:Carbon is .04% of atmosphere. Lets say humans make about 4% of that. That means .0016%. This means human contribution to the atmosphere in carbon is a mere 16 ppm (parts per million), or 1.6 out of 100,000.So lets assume CO2 can heat to a large extent. But the CO2 in this analogy is people. There are 100,000 people in a room, heating it up. We add 1.6 people or remove 1.6 people. That will have no measurable effects. If I argued it did it would be absurd right? Same with CO2. With the low amount humans are adding it is absurd CO2 is the main cause of the warming. [1]III. 'Proof'1. CO2 does trap heat, but as mentioned:a) Not that muchb) 1.6/100,000 will have little effect. 2. My opponent agrees natural factors are some of the warming, but CO2 is still a larger component. My opponent claims we must show CO2 to make an accurate computer model. But in reality that makes no sense. Unless you are trying to get a non-existent correlation. If you look at these models in the past, they actually refute the points that CO2 causes warming. Temperatures may be warmer then today's, but have lower CO2 numbers. That's something the alarmist crowd has been trying to hide. And my opponent claims there has been a correlation of CO2 and temperatures in the last century. But lets look at facts: 'In the last decade, there has been no clear warming trend (as the UK Met Office and IPCC’s own figures demonstrate). In the last century, much of the warming occurred prior to 1940, when human emissions of CO2 were relatively small compared to today.' [2]3. I have already shown the absurdity of this, using facts and numbers that where easy to comprehend. CO2 blocks little and has no/little possible effect. It may be likely other stronger gases are creating this (N2O or methane) but unlikely CO2. Also where the atmosphere is relates more with air pressure. ******Natural cycle My opponent can't really salvage his case, as in reality science is against him. He would have to have to prove unprecedented, as he claims CO2 cannot make all of this heat. Well natural factors did it WITHOUT HUMAN CO2. Here is a graph:As we can see the earth does this all the time without human CO2. So the question that refutes and destroys my opponents case is: Why not now? His only possible arunment is that it is 'unprecidented'. But those argunments are bound to fail. CONCLUSION:Pretty much read II and III. The science is against my opponent.

    <t>Thanks for a swift reply. I. WHAT IS A GREENHOUSE GAS? This was an observation as my partner points out. Conceded to both sides.II. THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT  My partner's claim is that CO2 is very minute scale in the atmosphere and it really doesn't effect us that much. However, let's see how much CO2 can hurt us. This graph is from NASA and it shows the relationship between CO2 and climate change: [1]The current level of CO2 is 380 parter per million. So, my partner brought up a good question: IF carbon dioxide makes up only a minute portion of the atmosphere, how can global warming be traced to it? And how can such a tiny amount of change produce such large effects? Pieter Tans from NOAA's Earth system Research Labratory provides this answer: [2]   'The earth's surface absorbs visible radiation from the sun, which causes heating. At the same time the surface and the atmosphere emit infrared radiation back to space, which produces cooling. Our eyes cannot see infrared radiation but we can feel how our skin absorbs it when we are standing next to a hot object without touching it. Over a long period the earth's surface temperature will remain approximately constant because the amount of heat absorbed as visible light is equal to the amount emitted as infrared light. Nitrogen, oxygen and argon together comprise more than 99 percent of the atmosphere. None of these three gases absorb either visible or infrared light; both types penetrate the entire atmosphere. It is as though, when it comes to the absorption and emission of light, the atmosphere's three main components do not exist!' So, what is happening is as the surface of the earth absorbs visible radiation from the sun, it causes heating. Simultaniously, the surface and the atmosphere emit infrared radiation back into space which produces cooling. Although Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Argon together make up 99% of the atmosphere, these gasses do not absorb visible or infrared light thus penetrating the entire atmosphere. Consequently, the greenhosue gasses take their toll. He continues: 'The next most abundant gases--water vapor and carbon dioxide--do absorb a portion of the infrared heat radiated by the earth's surface, thereby preventing it from reaching space. Instead of dissipating into space, the infrared radiation that is absorbed by atmospheric water vapor or carbon dioxide produces heating, which in turn makes the earth's surface warmer. This is known as the greenhouse effect and without it our planet's surface would likely be frozen, like Mars. The heat absorbed by water vapor and carbon dioxide is shared with all the nitrogen, oxygen and argon, because the latter molecules are always bumping into water vapor and carbon dioxide as they mix in the atmosphere. This effect makes the atmosphere act somewhat like a blanket that becomes thicker when amounts of water vapor, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide, increase. The top of the blanket remains cold and continues to emit about the same amount of infrared to space but below the blanket it gets warmer because it is more difficult for the heat to rise to the top. The heating effect of extra carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and many other minor gases can be calculated with confidence based on the absorption properties that have been measured carefully in the laboratory. Currently, the total heating produced by the increases of all long-lived greenhouse gases (excluding water vapor) since preindustrial times is equal to about 1 percent of all solar radiation absorbed at the surface. The effect would be somewhat similar if the sun had started to shine 1 percent more brightly during the 20th century.'  Next, 16kadams claims that human CO2 are too tiny to matter; less than 5%. However, this once more is not entirely accurate. From the graph and from ice cores, we see that CO2 in the atmosphere remained stable between 180-300 ppm for the past 500,000 years [3]. In recent centuries since we started contributing to CO2, it has risen vastly to over 380 ppm. What does all this show? it shows that humans do play an important factor in the contribution to CO2. III. PROOF I cited 3 proofs to show that humans are contributing mainly to global warming: (1) Human finger print on CO2; (2) Nature alone cannot account for the changes that we see; and (3) Lower-level atmosphere — which contains the carbon load—is expanding. 1. CO2 does trap heat, but as mentioned:See above as I have refuted what my partner stated above REFUTATIONS TO CON'S R1lt; Natural cycles Noted above.Problems with the GH theory My partner is correct in saying that water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas; however, CO2 still plays the most important role in greenhouse gas. We do not want to look only at the abundance of the greenhosue gas; but also its influence. The Union of Concerned Scientists notes: [4] 'CO2 has caused most of the warming and its influence is expected to continue. CO2, more than any other climate driver, has contributed the most to climate change between 1750 and 2005.[1, 2, 3] The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued a global climate assessment in 2007 that compared the relative influence exerted by key heat-trapping gases, tiny particles known as aerosols, and land use change of human origin on our climate between 1750 and 2005.[3] By measuring the abundance of heat-trapping gases in ice cores, the atmosphere, and other climate drivers along with models, the IPCC calculated the “radiative forcing” (RF) of each climate driver—in other words, the net increase (or decrease) in the amount of energy reaching Earth’s surface attributable to that climate driver. Positive RF values represent average surface warming and negative values represent average surface cooling. CO2 has the highest positive RF (see Figure 1) of all the human-influenced climate drivers compared by the IPCC. Other gases have more potent heat-trapping ability molecule per molecule than CO2 (e.g. methane), but are simply far less abundant in the atmosphere and being added more slowly.'Here is a graph from the same source to note the climate influence of the different greenhouse gasses.Out of room/time.</t>

The impact is that even if she proves that global warming is natural, and we refuse to accept my evidence that it is man-made, it doesn't matter because we have to then discuss the impacts of global warming in order to determine if it is an issue. Again, this was dropped in the speech she just delivered.Scientific EvidenceShe next tells you that she concedes that 4000 years (her evidence) is not long enough to determine if there is a cycle or not, but neither is 400,000 years. First, she cold drops the analysis I gave about how the cycles last for 100,000 years each, meaning that 400,000 years is enough to note the trends in the modern cycle. Second, this argument is just nonsensical. If we cannot look at either of our evidence, how do we determine if global warming is natural? She is literally telling you that we should drop all scientific evidence and just pretend that it is not an issue. Third, she concedes to the validity of my evidence the moment she argues that there is a cycle. My evidence adequately demonstrates this cycle. How can we determine if there is a cycle or not if we ignore the evidence? Since she agrees that a cycle exists (as evidenced by the fact that she argued this in her previous round), and we only know that a cycle exists because of my scientific evidence, she essentially has conceded to the validity of my evidence.Moreover, I will be accepting one of my opponent' sources because it examines evidence from the past 500,000,000 years and reaches the same conclusion that I did previously [1]. Please refer to the debate below.So, you can extend all of the dropped analysis relating to this evidence. First extend the argument that atmospheric carbon dioxide is increasing at a rate that is exponentially higher than it should be. The levels we are currently experiencing are higher than those that are present due to the cycle. Then extend the evidence that, according to the cycle, we should be in a reduction phase; meaning that we are actually going opposite of the trend. None of this is a result of natural processes; since the Industrial Revolution, we have been adding CO2 to the atmosphere. The impacts of all of this is that global warming is indeed an artificial phenomenon.Natural SelectionShe's completely misunderstanding the point. I never said that natural selection involves murder; I said that she is using Natural Selection to justify murder. Her argument is that organisms who were 'meant to survive' will survive, so altering the Earth's climate is ok. My analysis notes that we have no right to artificially alter the Earth's climate because the organisms that are currently alive have a right to life; we cannot justify their slaughter by claiming that they were meant to die. Moreover, a great chunk of the organisms killed will be human, and in society we recognize that other humans have rights.I would like to extend the source that she provided in this section of the debate because it provides a plethora of evidence for my side. [1] Let us examine this evidence from the source that she provided and agrees with.The first thing that it tells you is that the only other time that Earth has ever had such high CO2 levels in the atmosphere was during periods that resulted from artificial rises due to asteroid collisions [1]. That means that the source is telling you that CO2 levels get to this level only through artificial means. 'Raising atmospheric CO2 level at a rate of 2ppm/year, a pace unprecedented in the geological record, with the exception of the effects of CO2 released from craters excavated by large asteroid impacts, the deleterious effects of pollution and deforestation have reached a geological dimension, tracking towards conditions which existed on Earth in the mid-Pliocene, about 2.8 million years ago.' [1] Note that the source even tells you that the increases in atmospheric CO2 are a result of pollution and deforestation, which are activities that are done by humans.The second thing that it does is provide more evidence for my contention about ocean levels rising and ocean acidification.' According to her source,'When the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere rises above a critical threshold, climate shifts to a different state. Any significant increase in the level of carbon gases triggers powerful feedbacks. These include ice melt/warm water interaction, decline of ice reflection (albedo) and increase in infrared absorption by exposed water. Further release of CO2 from the oceans and from drying and burning vegetation shifts global climate zones towards the poles, warms the oceans and induces ocean acidification.' [1] This provides more evidence for a later portion of the debate.The third thing that her source tells you is that natural disasters, like firestorms, will result from global warming. [1]. 'The consequences of open ended rise in atmospheric CO2 are manifest in the geological record (Frontispiece). The world is in a lag period, when increasing atmospheric energy is expressed by intense hurricanes, increased pressure at mid-latitude high pressure zones and shift of climate zones towards the poles. With ensuing desertification of temperate zones, i.e. southern Europe, southern Australia, southern Africa, the desiccated forests become prey to firestorms, such as in Victoria and California.'All of this is directly from the source that my opponent posted. She accepts this source as true, so please extend the evidence from it.Ice AgesI was not asking for evidence that five Ice Ages occur; I was asking for evidence that they were a result of CO2 increases. She drops all of the evidence that I provided that demonstrates that they were a result of decreased CO2 in the atmosphere. Extend that cleanly across the flow.Carbon EmissionsShe insists that the carbon fluctuations are natural, but she has not provided any alternative mechanism that explains why 1. Carbon Dioxide levels are increasing at an unprecedented rate and 2. Why they are increasing at all, since the cycle demonstrates that they should currently be decreasing. Moreover, her own sources tell you that atmospheric carbon dioxide is increasing at unprecedented rates due to pollution and and deforestation, artificial phenomena, and it examines evidence from the past 500 million years [1]. At this point there is no reason to conclude that current global warming trends are natural.ImpactsExtend the first impact, namely that 30% of all plant and animal species will perish as a result of global warming, because she has dropped this argument entirely in the past two rounds. Extend the other argument about global disasters because she dropped the argument in this round when I asked her to provide evidence from the actual study instead of conservative blogs. Both of these are deleterious impacts of global warming that can cost millions of lives.She decides to address the argument about ocean levels rising and flooding coastal cities. First, this is pretty unfair, considering that she dropped the argument previously, but I will debunk her response anyways. Her response is that people will live in dangerous flood areas, so their homes will be underwater for other reasons. This is entirely nonresponsive to the argument, which notes that coastal cities that are currently not underwater will be underwater in the future due to increases in ocean levels (something that her own source agrees with) that result from global warming. Areas that are currently not flood areas will soon be converted into flood areas.</t>
<h>    The impact is that even if she proves that global warming is natural, and we refuse to accept my evidence that it is man-made.</h>

    <t>Response to Opponent's CaseThe first thing that she tells you is that she believes in global climate change. She notes that throughout history, there have been significant climate changes.This is extremely important. The moment that she concedes that global climate changes exist in a cycle, she concedes that global warming exists. Even if it is just part of a cycle, she still agrees that global warming is something that can and does affect the Earth. This has an important impact in this round. Even if I lose the argument aboutwhether or not humans are responsible for global warming, she has still conceded that global warming exists so we must consider all of its impacts in order to determine whether or not it is an issue. The second thing that she tells you is that scientists who believe in global warming are not “looking at the big picture”. This is absolutely and undeniably false. I posted analysis about how, based on trends in climate change from the past 400,000 years, not only have our carbon levels been expontentially increasing at a rate that is higher than the rate that should result from the cycle, but that current trends are also defying the cycle, because carbon levels in the atmosphere should currently be decreasing. In fact, when she tells you to look at the “overall picture”, she is not even analyzing trends from the past 400,000 years; her analysis only extends back 4,000 years, which is not even enough time to complete a single cycle. This argument should thus not be considered. She next argues that disasters are fine because by natural selection, species will adapt to changes in climate. This may be true, but it denies humans who are currently living their right to life. Using natural selection as a justification for permitting policies means that we should also permit murder, theft, etc. because the most fit individuals will survive. Obviously, however, we do not because we believe that all humans have inalienable rights, so we should not be wilfully demolishing the environment and killing countless humans just to promote survival of the fittest. Defense of CaseShe first notes that she never said that global warming exists. That is absolutely false. The moment she conceded that cycles of global climate change exist, she concedes that global warming occurs naturally. Cycles have upwards and downwards trends; if temperature decreases, it also has to increase. “Also, in the chart above, 400,000 years is not enough proof to show that this is not natural because the pattern itself has been occurring for far longer. The earth has been around for about 4.6 billion years.”This argument is completely false and hypocritical. It is false because the cycles occur every 100,000 years, so we can easily examine how the climate changes by examining the past 400,000 years. Moreover, it is incredibly hypocritical because her analysis only extends for 4000 years. If my analysis, which examines a period of time 100 times longer than her analysis, should not be considered, we should not even spend half of a neuron considering thinking about looking at her analysis. At this point in time, my analysis is better than her analysis because the data that I am examining belongs to a greater set than the data she is examining. My data is therefore more objective and more likely to reveal the truth than her data is. “There have been five Ice Ages in the Earth's past. These Ice Ages occurred because of high carbon emission.”This is not even close to true (note that my opponent never provided a source). Ice Ages are caused by reductions in atmospheric carbon dioxide and not because of high carbon dioxide emissions. “Maureen Raymo,William Ruddiman and others propose that theTibetan andColorado Plateaus are immense CO2 'scrubbers' with a capacity to remove enough CO2 from the global atmosphere to be a significant causal factor of the 40 million yearCenozoic Cooling trend. They further claim that approximately half of their uplift (and CO2 'scrubbing' capacity) occurred in the past 10 million years.” [1] “There is evidence thatgreenhouse gas levels fell at the start of ice ages and rose during the retreat of the ice sheets . . . TheSnowball Earth hypothesis maintains that the severe freezing in the lateProterozoic was ended by an increase in CO2 levels in the atmosphere, and some supporters of Snowball Earth argue that it was caused by a reduction in atmospheric CO2.” [1] This fits the trends that I have argued in my previous analysis, namely that increases in CO2 cause temperature increases, and decreases in CO2 cause temperature decreases. “So, to say that carbon levels rising are not natural is a false statement.”This is a strawman logical fallacy. I never said that increases in carbon levels are not natural; I said that the manner in which they are currently increasing is not natural because they are exponentially increasing to levels higher than those that results from the cycle and they are increasing at rates that should not be occurring if we are examining the cycle. The cycle predicts a decrease in CO2 emissions at this point in history. My opponent has offered no alternative explanation as to why we are currently defying the cycle and why CO2 levels are increasing to such high levels. The cycle predicts carbon dioxide levels at about 285 ppm for the peak year 1850. The current concentration is 385 ppm. Impacts of Global WarmingShe drops all of the analysis about the following impacts: the disruption of biological systems and the massive damage to humanity as a result of increases in ocean levels. The evidence I provided for the disruption of biological systems noted that global warming will be responsible for the destruction of 30% of the current flora and fauna. The evidence I provided for the massive damages to humanity demonstrated that several cities would be left underwater, causing millions of deaths and trillions of dollars in economic damages. These were cold dropped, so extend them cleanly across the flow. Unless she wants to argue that destruction of 30% of the species on Earth and the deaths of millions of humans and trillions of dollars worth of damage in economic costs are all good, this is a sufficient reason to vote for me. She does, however, attack the analysis I provided about Natural Disasters. She first claims that my source is based on a false UN Report. First, my argument was not from a UN report. The source I used mentioned the UN report in reference to a different argument that I did not use in this round; my evidence was based on a different study. Second, I did a quick Google search using the quote “We find insufficient evidence to claim a statistical relationship between global temperature increase and catastrophic losses” and only found links to conservative blogs claiming that the report said that. Such a devastating report surely should be easy to find, so I challenge my opponent to find the original report, not a bunch of conservative blogs that claim that the report said it, and paste the link here.Third, my argument is based on the rise of heat waves. Heat waves are known to cause natural disasters like tornadoes and hurricanes </t>

    <t>I am going to try something that I have not done for a year. Instead of doing a specific line-by-line, I will be using this round to crystallize my position because I do not think that my opponent really made a substantive effort to attack my position in this round. That does mean that I am dropping anything; I will cover the flow as I tell the “story of the round”. Before I begin, however, I would like to address this argument that my opponent makes about 0.2% of the greenhouse effect being due to humans. I have no idea where she got this from; she did not source this statistic, so I cannot explain why the methodology of the statistic was wrong. Moreover, some of her other sources contradict this argument and statistic, so there is no reason to accept it. CyclesThis round rests on whether or not global warming has an impact. As my observation noted, as long as my opponent believes that there is any type of climate change, global warming necessarily has to exist. This means that even if my opponent has convinced you that global warming is entirely a natural process, she does not win this debate. She needs to demonstrate that the impacts of that process are meaningless, so any discussion of whether or not it is artificial is tangential to the real debate. This observation has been dropped since Round 3. My opponent has maintained throughout this round that any climate change is a result of a cycle.This means that she concedes that global warming does exist in some form. I also agree that cycles exist. I provided evidence in Round 1 that demonstrate that there are cycles every 100,000 years in which carbon levels peak at 285 ppm. According to my evidence, we reached this peak in 1850. That means, according to the cycles, we should not only have reduced carbon levels at the moment, but that we should also be witnessing a reduction in temperature and a reduction in carbon levels. The evidence that I cited notes that our carbon levels are currently increasing at an exponentially high rate and are going against the trends established by the cycle. My opponent then proceeded to not only reject my evidence based on time period, but to also concede that her own evidence did not examine the Earth’s history properly. She completely dropped the argument that I made, however, about how since the cycles last 100,000 years, my evidence, which extends back 600,000 years, is enough to see the trends. Moreover, if she is rejecting her own evidence, she has no basis for for making the claim that global climate change is natural because she has nothing to back up her arguments. She already conceded that her evidence is false, and she did not provide any more evidence to support her assertions. This itself is a reason to accept my evidence because she has not provided any sort of alternative studies that she considers to be more accurate. Ergo, she cannot make her unsupported assertions.While discussing another argument, opponent did provide us with evidence that examines that past 500 million years. Happily, that evidence supports my position. It explicitly notes, “Raising atmospheric CO2 level at a rate of 2ppm/year, a pace unprecedented in the geological record, with the exception of the effects of CO2 released from craters excavated by large asteroid impacts, the deleterious effects of pollution and deforestation have reached a geological dimension, tracking towards conditions which existed on Earth in the mid-Pliocene, about 2.8 million years ago.' Her own evidence is literally telling you that the only time that we have had such rapid increases in CO2 levels was when massive asteroids collided with Earth. Ergo, by her own evidence, which examines the past 500 million years, these levels are only reached artificially, and are not a natural part of the cycle. This was entirely dropped by my opponent. That should be enough to tell you that the global warming we are experiencing is an artificial phenomenon. ImpactsI discussed three impacts of global warming that demonstrate that it is, in fact, an issue. The first impact was that there will be a 30% decrease in the flora and fauna species of this planet. Her only response to this was natural selection allows for the best adapted species to survive. She still has not responded to the rights analysis that I posted in Round 1. Even if the beings who are most fit to survive will survive, that does not mean that we are justified in committing acts that will cause the destruction of 30% of Earth’s species because they have a right to survive. Natural adaptation and competition is one thing, but specifically causing harms to those species is another. It’s the difference between chopping someone’s leg off and seeing someone being born with a birth defect. One is natural and is not our fault. The other is something that we are doing actively and is a violation of rights. The second impact was the increase in natural disasters due to an increase in heat waves. She continuously asserts that global warming does not cause natural disasters. First, I would like to point out that in Round 4, she conceded that the evidence she provided that said there was no link was faulty. Therefore, she is just asserting that there is no link. Second, her own evidence from Round 4 explicitly notes that there will be an increase in natural disasters. I will post the quote again because she dropped it: 'The consequences of open ended rise in atmospheric CO2 are manifest in the geological record (Frontispiece). The world is in a lag period, when increasing atmospheric energy is expressed by intense hurricanes, increased pressure at mid-latitude high pressure zones and shift of climate zones towards the poles. With ensuing desertification of temperate zones, i.e. southern Europe, southern Australia, southern Africa, the desiccated forests become prey to firestorms, such as in Victoria and California.' Her own evidence that SHE chose to cite says that there will be an increase in firestorms and hurricanes. Therefore, global warming increases natural disasters and thus deaths. The final impact was flooding in coastal cities and the deaths of millions of humans and damages in billions of dollars. After Round 3, she did not even attempt to address this point at all. This point is thus conceded and is a cause for concern. By itself, it notes that global warming is an issue because it can cause millions of deaths by flooding coastal cities that are currently above water and also causing billions of dollars in damages to those cities. Voting IssuesPlease vote pro on the following points: 1. Global warming is man-made. She provided no evidence to support her assertions of a wholly natural cycle after she conceded that her evidence should not have been used. 2. Global warming has disastrous effects. Her own sources tell you that there are a rise in natural disasters and she dropped the analysis about the flooding of coastal cities, plethora of human deaths, and and damages in billions of dollars.</t>

    <t>As per my opponent's outline, I will only be presenting case arguments in this round. Rebuttals were specifically reserved for the next round by my opponent in Round 1. CaseMy case will be twofold. First, I will demonstrate that Global Warming does, in fact, exist even though it should not be happening. Second, I will demonstrate that Global Warming will adversely affect the human species. ObservationEven if global warming is a natural phenomenon, it still exists, so you can extend the portion of my analysis in which she concedes that there is a current global trend for increased surface temperatures. My burden in this debate, therefore, is to demonstrate that this increase in surface temperatures is, in fact, an issue, so as long as I prove that the increased temperatures that my opponent concedes occur are disastrous, you vote Pro. However, I will also be presenting evidence that global warming is a result of human activities. This is not necessary for me to win the round because she concedes that there are worldwide increases in surface temperature, but I shall do so anyways. Global Warming ExistsGlobal temperatures are, for the most part, depend on the levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere [1]. Greenhouse gases are gases that absorb and emit radiation within the thermal infrared range and that are responsible fore the greenhouse effect [2]. The Greenhouse Effect is a a process by which thermal radiation from a planetary surface is absorbed by atmospheric greenhouse gases, and is re-radiated in all directions. [3] Through the Greenhouse Effect, heat from the sun is trapped by the greenhouse gases and projected down to the Earth. This results in increased surface temperatures [3].  Since carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and increased levels of greenhouse gases result in increases in surface temperatures of the Earth's surface, increased carbon dioxide levels cause increases in global surface temperatures.    My opponent is correct when she argues that there are natural cycles for global climate change. The fundamental problem with er analysis is that the current trend is not following the natural cycle. Analysis of the current levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere indicates that the levels are higher than those that were seen for at least the last 400,000 years of Earth's history. Moreover, whereas the carbon dioxide levels in Earth's atmosphere generally increases gradually, the levels in our atmosphere have been increasing at exponentially frightening rates.     As the above graph adequately demonstrates, the current carbon level vastly exceed the levels that would result from the cycle. In fact, based on the chart, the cycle levels peaked at the year 1850, meaning that if this were a result of the cycle, we currently should be experiencing a decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and thus lower global temperatures. In fact, not only is this not following the trend, but it is defying it entirely. This is a direct result of human activities and the Industrial Revolution. Using the carbon dioxide trapped in ice-caps, scientists can determine the atmosheric concentrations of specific gases at the time at which the ice was formed. Pre-industrial revolution carbon dioxide levels were about 285 ppm [1]. The current concentration is 385 ppm [1]. This is unnatural, as evidenced by the fact that in the last 650,000 years (the ice cap does not go beyond this age), the carbon dioxide concentration during warm periods has varied between 180 ppm and 300 ppm [1]. It has never exceeded 300 ppm until now, a time at which we should be experiencing a global reduction in carbon dioxide levels. Ergo, the increase in carbon dioxide levels is unnatural and was caused by humans. Global Warming is DisastrousIn reality, whether or not global warming is man-made or natural is immaterial to this round because my opponent has already conceded that we are currently in an age of surface temperature increases. This means that we should be focusing on the impacts of global warming. As long as I demonstrate that the impacts of global warming are disastrous, I win the round regardless of whether or not it is natural because it then becomes an issue. Projected effects: First, increases in temperature are likely to cause more disruptions in biological systems [4]. This threatens the extinction of many endangered species [4]. In fact, it is projected that after the year 2050, climate change will be the primary driving force behind the loss of global biodiversity. [4]. In fact, studies indicate that approximately 30% of all plant and animal species would face extinction if the global temperature rises to about 4 degrees above the pre-industrial levels [4]. Second, natural disasters are projected to increase as a result of global temperature increases. Scientists have noted that extreme weather is linked to heat waves, which would increase as a result of global warming. Thus, scientists contend, there is likely to be an increase in droughts, tropical cyclone activities, and tsunamis. [4]. All of these are horrendous natural disasters that have massive costs in terms of human life. Third, changes to the ocean would cause massive damages to both humanity and to other life forms. The ocean currently serves as a 'sink for carbon dioxide, meaning that it takes up CO2 that otherwise would have remained in the atmosphere [4]. Increased CO2 levels would cause an increase in ocean intake of CO2 and would thus result in acidification of the oceans. [4]. This would adversely affect many species because a delicate pH must be maintained in order for most species to survive. Moreover, not only does global warming result in ocean acidication, but it also would cause sea-levels to rise for two reasons. First, thermal expansion would lead to the expansion of water and thus a rise in ocean levels. Second, global warming results in rises in ocean levels due to the melting of ice caps [4]. Rises in ocean levels would cause coastal flooding. By the year 2030, several major cities across the globe will be underwater as a result of ocean level changes. [5] This would cause millions of human deaths as well as cost hundreds of billions of dollars in damage. Thus, global warming is man-made and is an issue because it is disastrous. </t>

    <t>Global warming caused by humans?  In round three of this debate I stated that 'Human additions to total greenhouse gases play a small role, contributing about 0.2% - 0.3% to Earth's greenhouse effect.' The definition of global warming is 'what happens when the temperature of the earth increases. This temperature increase is something that happens naturally, although it is also contributed to by human activity.' So as I've stated in the past. I do believe that human involvement is occurring during this stage of the earth's global climate change, but I think it is a very small amount, and for the most part is a natural process.  Dropping Evidence:  The reason I dropped the scientific evidence from the previous rounds is because the earth has been in the universe for 4.6 billion years. So although both of the previous charts may be true, they do not go back far enough to state if global warming is an issue or not. There will always be natural climate cycles. Nothing can stop that from occurring.  Natural Selection:  I do not justify murder by believing in the theory of natural selection. Natural Selection is the survival of the fittest. By survival of the fittest I mean a natural process resulting in the evolution of organisms best adapted to the environment. Humans might even be able to adapt to the climate changes and live through this climate change. It has been going on for so long and we and many other species are still alive. So, to reiterate, I do not justify murder, I just believe that the most well adapted species will survive.  My source from the previous round:  Humans are only altering the earth slightly, as I've said in previous rounds. Also, most species do alter the earth in either a good way or a bad way. At the time that humans first started to increase their carbon dioxide use, they didn't plan on slightly causing the earth's temperatures to rise.  As I have stated in round 3 of this debate, as of now, there is no proof that global warming causes natural disasters. The word natural means that it exists by nature; not made or caused by humankind. And in this argument, you believe that global warming is man-made. So to state that natural disasters are caused by humans must be false because of the definition of the word NATURAL.  Ice Ages:  I do recognize that Ice Ages are caused by low amounts of CO2. The reason that I had mentioned Ice Ages was to show that the earth has high and low amounts. Another reason I mentioned this was to prove that climate changes are natural and that they occur no matter what and there is nothing that humans can do to stop this from occurring.  Carbon Emission:  In my past arguments I have been able to show that carbon levels rise and fall and I have shown many sources that prove that. The reason they are rising is because cycles always occur and the earth is just taking its natural course, like I have said multiple times!  Impacts:  As I have stated earlier, as the earth changes, species die off. It has happened many times in the past and will happen many times in the future. The species that do become extinct were just not the most fit and could not live through different climate changes.  Conclusion:  I still do not believe that global warming is an issue. Earth will continue to change naturally and there is nothing that humans can do to change this from happening. This type of climate change has been going on for a long period of time. Earth is just trying to balance out all the changes that are occurring in the only way it knows how to.</t>

    <t>First I would like to point out that I never said global warming was not happening. I simply stated that I do not believe that it is an issue, or at least not a main issue. I do however believe that there are climate changes happening all around the world. So I will not try to argue with the first half of your argument.  Natural Cycles:  To a certain extent, the chart shown above does, in fact, follow a natural cycle. In any case, even though there is a significant spike today, the cycle is still natural. The greenhouse effect is what causes the cycle. The spike is just noting our involvement in the greenhouse effect (through our increase use of carbon). The spike is not signifying that global warming is occurring, it is just noting that there is an increase in the cycle.  Also, in the chart above, 400,000 years is not enough proof to show that this is not natural because the pattern itself has been occurring for far longer. The earth has been around for about 4.6 billion years. Temperature Increase: The increase in temperature is nature's way of eliminating the species that would not be able to survive in the long run. Similar drastic temperature changes happened before both of Earth's previous Ice Ages. There have been five Ice Ages in the Earth's past. These Ice Ages occurred because of high carbon emission. During the first few Ice Ages, men were not even alive. So, to say that carbon levels rising are not natural is a false statement. This pattern is inevitable and therefore not an issue, since there is nothing we can do to prevent it.  Global Warming Doesn't Cause Natural Disasters:  There is no evidence that global warming causes natural disasters. You used a source that spoke about the UN IPCC AR4. Well, in one of my sources it states that, 'The UN IPCC AR4 claim was based upon an unpublished report by Robert Muir-Wood, which was published later in 2008 with the new caveat that: 'We find insufficient evidence to claim a statistical relationship between global temperature increase and catastrophic losses.'' (Anderson) Global losses from natural disasters have been going up about 8% per year. But since there are more people and more building in risky areas occurring, there is no proof about global warming causing natural disasters.  Human Involvement:  The Greenhouse Effect is a natural process, one that, though we do play a slight role in it, we are not entirely the cause of. Human additions to total greenhouse gases play a small role, contributing about 0.2% - 0.3% to Earth's greenhouse effect.  'Global warming started long before the 'Industrial Revolution' and the invention of the internal combustion engine. Global warming began 18,000 years ago as the earth started warming its way out of the Pleistocene Ice Age' (A Chilling Perspective). The Earth's climate has been constantly fluctuating. As of now, we are currently at a reprieve from the deep freeze.  Thus, Global Warming is not man-made and is not an issue.</t>

    <t>My chart:  Yes I do recognize that my chart only goes back 4,000 years. I still do believe that you stating that at 400,000 years are enough information to say that global warming is an issue, is not true.  Natural Selection:  I do not by any means necessary believe that murdering another person is a part of natural selection. The meaning of natural selection is the gradual, non-random, process by which biological traits become either more or less common in a population as a function of differential reproduction of their bearers. Natural selection does not have anything to do with murder, just about a person or animal biological features are able to keep them alive or not. Meaning, that if this global climate change is occurring, the animals that are meant to make it through this period, will be able to. In this chart, http://www.onlineopinion.com.au... it goes back 500 million years. This chart shows past Carbon Dioxide levels and past extinctions. This just proves my point that too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has killed certain species and some have still been able to live through it because of their biological make up.  Ice Ages:  I did not realize that I forgot to provide a source for the amount of ice ages that have occurred. But in this website: http://en.wikipedia.org..., it states that there have been 5 ice ages.  Carbon Dioxide Emissions:  'Changes in past atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations can be determined by measuring the composition of air trapped in ice cores from Antarctica.' This quote states there must be changes in the earth's carbon emission for something bad to occur. I do realize that I did attain false information and I do apologize for that. But there still have been high levels of carbon dioxide in the past. So, I still do believe that carbon levels do fluctuates and this is natural. Like Isaac Newton, I do believe that what goes up must come down. I do realize that he was referring to gravity, but I think it applies for this case too, because carbon dioxide does fluctuate though out history. I have said this multiple times and I still do believe that this is the case.  Several cities being under water:  There are multiple reasons that cities will go under water, not only because of global warming. As I stated in the previous argument, people build in dangerous flood areas and they forget to mention that the do this.</t>

    <t>First, I would like to start off by saying that I do believe that there is a global climate change. Here are the reasons I do not believe global warming is an issue. My first reason I believe that global warming is not an issue is that, all throughout history, there have been significant climate changes. http://www.digitaljournal.com.... This chart is an example of the different climate changes throughout history. With all those climate changes, people were able to work though it and still survive.  Secondly, many people who are already worried about global warming are misinterpreting the information from the scientists. The people who do this are looking for evidence of global warming instead of looking at the evidence objectively and trying to figure out what it truly means. What I mean by this is people are just looking for reasons to say that global warming is true. But what people should be doing is looking at the big picture and seeing if this has happened in the past and figuring out ways to work through the climate change just like others did during the medieval warm period.  Thirdly, weather always fluctuates. Plants and animals are able to adjust to the climate changes that occurred in the past, so they should be able to do it after this change in weather. Charles Darwin came up with a theory called Survival of the Fittest. This theory states that 'species adapt and change by natural selection with the best suited mutations becoming dominant.' Darwin realized that over time, climates do change and so does the world. So, as the world changes, life adapts to the new environment.</t>

    <t>Global warming has been a growing problem over the decade, and with our destruction of forests, use of factories and pollution has undoubtedly contributed to it. As my opponent has stated, it will be his burden to prove that there are other priorities other than the environment, and my burden will be to prove that environment should be the priority over these other issues. I would like to define the following: World environment issues: the current hole we have in the ozone layer, amount of carbon dioxide we are releasing, pollution we are causing, cutting down trees, harming the land by mining... and so forth. Also, this not only contains the actions that are ruining the Earth, but also the ones that happen accidentally, such as oil spills. Priority: issue that is considered first over others Contention 1, Even the current actions aren't doing much to save the environment The Kyoto Protocol, foundations of renewable resources, and many actions have been taken to slow down the Global Warming. However, what good has it done? Sure it reduced the amount of Carbon dioxide we produce, but it still has been rising over the years continuously. See in the example of China. (I couldn't copy the chart on here so you'll have to go on the site to look at it) [1] In 2009, the total amount of carbon dioxide emission was 31,629,955 and in 2010, it was 33,508,901. [2] Contention 2, The world is not safe with these issues unsolved Sub point A. oil spills From the spill in the Gulf of Mexico, we briefly know how dangerous a spill can be. I will show you how exactly it will be harmful to us. Firstly, the fish and the birds die. Birds die from oil spills if their feathers are covered in oil. The bird will then be poisoned because it will try to clean itself. Animals may die because they get hypothermia, causing their body temperature to be really low. They may die from really low body temperature. Oil may also cause the death of an animal by entering the animal's lungs or liver. The animal will then be poisoned by the oil. Oil also can kill an animal by blinding it. The animal will not be able to see and be aware of their predators. If they are not aware of other animals, they may be eaten.[3] Secondly, humans are affected. The cleanup workers exposed to crude oil often suffer acute effects — stinging eyes, rashes, nausea, dizziness, headaches, coughs and other respiratory symptoms. Exposure to oil did induce DNA damage that was greater in those with more exposure. DNA damage can be the first step along the path to cancer.[4] Lastly, even if the companies manage to clean all of the oil, they can't do it perfectly, and some of the traces will still be left in the ocean. This will continue to kill the sea life and marine birds, and suppose that people ate that fish. The people will be poisoned and even if people don't eat this fish, there will be less fish for the fishers to catch. Spills may take weeks, months or even years to clean up.[5] So if an issue like this come up, the government will have to make this a priority because it can take a long time to clean up, and if it is left alone, then it will harm animals and people. Sub point B. decimation of forests. Decimation of forests will soon lead to too much trees being cut down, and we won't have enough trees to use, and the air to be filtered. Air is the necessity of life, but if we cut down too much trees, someday in the future, we won't have enough air for the entire population of the world.  Deforestation affects the amount of water in the soil and groundwater and the moisture in the atmosphere. Forests support considerable biodiversity, providing valuable habitat for wildlife; moreover, forests foster medicinal conservation and the recharge of aquifers.  With forest biotopes being a major, irreplaceable source of new drugs (like taxol), deforestation can destroy genetic variations (such as crop resistance) irretrievably.  Shrinking forest cover lessens the landscape's capacity to intercept, retain and transport precipitation. Instead of trapping precipitation, which then percolates to groundwater systems, deforested areas become sources of surface water runoff, which moves much faster than subsurface flows. That quicker transport of surface water can translate into flash flooding and more localized floods than would occur with the forest cover.  Deforestation also contributes to decreased evapotranspiration, which lessens atmospheric moisture which in some cases affects precipitation levels downwind from the deforested area, as water is not recycled to downwind forests, but is lost in runoff and returns directly to the oceans.  According to one preliminary study, in deforested north and northwest China, the average annual precipitation decreased by one third between the 1950s and the 1980s.  Long-term gains can be obtained by managing forest lands sustainable to maintain both forest cover and provide a biodegradable renewable resource.  Forests are also important stores of organic carbon, and forests can extract carbon dioxide and pollutants from the air, thus contributing to biosphere stability and probably relevant to the greenhouse effect. Forests are also valued for their aesthetic beauty and as a cultural resource and tourist attraction.  Sub point C. the overall unstable environment of the world The upper safety limit for atmospheric CO2 is 350 parts per million (ppm). Atmospheric CO2 levels have stayed higher than 350 ppm since early 1988. [6] According to this, our world is not safe enough for us to rely on the atmosphere. Eventually, something really bad will happen because we just keep continuously emitting carbon dioxide, we'll reach a point where the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is too high. Sub point D. the results of all these issues Scientists warned that as the hole closes up in the next few decades, temperatures on the continent could rise by around 3C on average, with melting ice contributing to a global sea-level increases of up to 1.4m.[7] This is only if the hole in the ozone layer stayed that way. But with the rate we are polluting the Earth, it is not going to stay that big, but it is going to get bigger. If we then try to wait for it to fix itself, the warming of Antarctica is going to continue, and in the end, we'll have oceans so high, that most coastal cities will be underwater. A new Ice Age could come from all this. If enough cold, fresh water coming from the melting polar ice caps and the melting glaciers of Greenland flows into the northern Atlantic, it will shut down the Gulf Stream, which keeps Europe and northeastern North America warm. The worst-case scenario would be a full-blown return of the last ice age - in a period as short as 2 to 3 years from its onset - and the mid-case scenario would be a period like the 'little ice age' of a few centuries ago that disrupted worldwide weather patterns leading to extremely harsh winters, droughts, worldwide desertification, crop failures, and wars around the world.</t>

    <t>The pro is arguing that the most important issue currently facing the world is related to its environment. I will be giving several examples of important world issues. If I can prove that at least one of these examples is more important than the world environment I have fulfilled my burden of proof, and therefore I should win.  We are humans, therefore the survival of humans and the minimization of human suffering should be our highest priority. The importance of an issue in this debate should be determined by the potential consequences of ignoring the issue. If the consequences of issue X are more severe than issue Y, then issue X becomes the top priority by default. My CaseIssue 1: Maintaining and Improving International Relations. Planet Earth has come a long way in the past couple thousand years. The most notable advancement humans have made is in technology. As of now, Syria, North Korea, and Iran are all in possession of nuclear weapons[1]. Three very unstable nations possessing nuclear weapons which are obviously capable of immense destructive power. If a Nuclear War was ever to occur, the loss of human life would be absolutely devastating. It is estimated that after a nuclear war, more than half of the world’s population would be wiped out[2]. Nuclear war has the greatest potential for severe consequences, therefore avoidance should be our highest priority. Issue 2: The Water Crisis. Currently, 3.5 million people die each year from water-related disease. 84% of the people who die are children between the ages of 0-14[3]. Obviously this is a significant loss of human life. Especially over such a trivial matter such as the availability of water and the sanitation of said water. This is a higher priority over the global environment because this crisis is occurring right this second. The pro’s issue of the global environment is not causing such a significant amount of death as with this crisis. Issue 3: Global OverpopulationDue to advancements in modern medicine, decreased mortality rates, and increased fertility rates; the human population is growing exponentially. This exponential growth will eventually lead to earth reaching its carrying capacity for human beings. What this means is that we will one day reach a point where the Earth will not longer be able to sustain the human population with its resources. This will result in mass starvation and chaos. The average scientific estimate for Earth’s carrying capacity is between 10-15 billion people[4]. Human beings will likely reach 9 billion people by 2050[5]. This is a serious and imminent danger. It may not directly affect us within our lifetime but we have an obligation to prevent human overpopulation because of the amount of suffering and death it would inevitably cause if left to continue.Pro Case Contention 1: Even the current actions aren't doing much to save the environmentI’m not going to dispute the fact that CO2 emissions have been rising, but what are the potential consequences of this? What makes this important enough that it should be the highest priority? The pro needs to make an argument instead of just listing facts.Contention 2: The world is not safe with these issues unsolvedSub point A. oil spillsThe first half of this sub-point touches on the deaths that will be caused to animals. The priority here is human life so unless this disaster could drastically affect human life then it should definitely not be the highest priority. As for the human suffering associated with cleaning up the oil spills, I have to ask how? Do they not wear protective gear when cleaning up a biohazard? Regardless, pro has only stated that it would essentially just cause pain/irritation and MAYBE in some cases cause cancer. The issues I will address in my case supercede this point because the potential consequences are much more deadly to the human populace. Sub point B. decimation of forests.'Decimation of forests will soon lead to too much trees being cut down, and we won't have enough trees to use, and the air to be filtered. Air is the necessity of life, but if we cut down too much trees, someday in the future, we won't have enough air for the entire population of the world.'I would really like to see a source to verify your claim that someday we won’t have enough air. Until I see evidence this is just a bare assertion and can be dismissed as such. As for the rest of the contention, flash flooding is a very minor issue compared to the ones I have addressed in my own case. Once again, I must ask, what are the potential consequences of ignoring the issue? Pro once again merely has a lengthy list of scientific information and no argumentation. What makes this issue so important that it must be the highest priority? Sub point C. the overall unstable environment of the world'The upper safety limit for atmospheric CO2 is 350 parts per million (ppm). Atmospheric CO2 levels have stayed higher than 350 ppm since early 1988. [6] According to this, our world is not safe enough for us to rely on the atmosphere. Eventually, something really bad will happen because we just keep continuously emitting carbon dioxide, we'll reach a point where the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is too high.'Eventually, something really bad will happen...Like what? What will happen when we reach this point where the CO2 is too high? Sub point D. the results of all these issuesPro never really addresses the results of ALL the issues listed above. They merely discuss the coming of a second ice age. I’m assuming this is related to the high CO2 emissions mentioned early, but I am not certain. While I must admit that the global environment is an important issue, it is not the most important. It is simply not the highest on our list of priorities.  So with that, I eagerly await my opponent's response!</t>

    <t>Before I start I would to point out we are debating the energy source of nuclear power, not the weapons. (see definitions and visual)C1: Nuclear power is a green energyNuclear power is regulated by the epa [1] It has no emissions when in the fission process, and the 'smoke' is actually steam. [1, 2] It only emits population indirectly (mining uranium). Although not renewable, it is sustainable and green. [2, 3] Some newer in development reactors are are very sustainable and would power us for 5 billion years! [2, 4] That is the lifetime of the sun btw. [5] Another type of reactor takes the uranium from sea water, and this amount replenishes and never runs out, so would in fact be essentially renewable. [3, 6] One misconception is the waste is bad for the environment. The waste is easily containable and actually is being safely contained today. [7] Nuclear power is clean, and this is comparable to other power sources like solar, but function at much more higher efficiencies. [7] Also the goverment is pressing for greener energies, and nuclear is on the page for a green energy. [8]Now, the claims about nuclear power being dirty is false as they cannot emit CO2 and other gases directly, and if need be I will pull up stats showing they even emmits less then solar!C2: Safety of nuclear powerNuclear power plants are very durable and rarely break down, and their safety record compares to other energies. [9, 10] One argument is terrorists attacks, they have safeguards preventing this and other security systems. [9] Also its never happened. [9] Also the plant will not explode as the uranium is only enriched to a 5% level. Their newer reactors usually have competent workers and are safe when the workers do their 'thing'. [11] The safety of nuclear power is great! Future development keeps plants safer and even more reliable. [15] Banning it would mean stopping production and advancements while we take the long amount of time to take them down. This means the power will become more dangerous while the deconstructions begin as they will be old models. Keeping it going means they get safer. C3: CostNuclear power is comparable to other cheap forms of energy. [12] The actual fuel costs for nuclear power are relatively small. [12] The costs of nuclear power re cheaper then coal (a cheap power source), natural gas, and oil/ [12] Nuclear power currency supplies 1% of the worlds energy at low costs. [13] The plants are cheap to operate and are only costly when building the plant. [13] Nuclear power competes in prices with all energy forms as nuclear production is cheap. [13] People are making thorium nuclear power which CANNOT melt down ever or be weaponized. They are also cheap. [14] These new plants mean the future of nuclear power will be cheaper and safer. [14] Nuclear power is 25% cheaper then coal and less then 25% if the cost of gas. [16]C4: JobsThe nuclear industry is expanding, even in the bad economy. [17] One nuclear power plant alone hires 1-2000 people. [17] And others in temporary building procedures. [17] Not only is this power green and safe, but would create thousands of jobs in the US. [18] In Canada alone they employ 66,000 people. [19]---gt; ConclusionNeed I say more? Nuclear power ought to be allowed as one of the green energies of america.</t>

    <t>I thank my opponent for re-instigating this topic for me. This is an acceptance round so I'll just post my model (so con knows what he's arguing against, more exactly).  My contention is that, by international treaty, nuclear power should be outlawed. Obviously this could not be done overnight - reactors take an awfully long time to shut down, and then there's thousands of nuclear-powered weapons to take care of. An exception would be made for some scientific research, under very carefully controlled conditions. In general, no such experiment should involve the generation of very large amounts of nuclear power except in extraordinary circumstances, and then only very briefly. The ICC would be empowered to arbritrate if nuclear power use was suspected, either in a civil or a military capacity.  I wish my opponent very good luck for the debate and look forward to reading his opening round!</t>

    <t>Yay, I managed to get this short enough at last!I thank con for getting this going. In doing this debate, I follow in the great tradition of New Zealand's former prime minister David Lange. In 1985 at Oxford Union, in a debate so intense even the US president tuned in, he fought against Jerry Falwell, a noted friend of then-US-president Ronald Regan, arguing against the motion 'nuclear weapons are morally indefensible'. Lange became the first person in decades to recieve a standing ovation from both sides of the house [1]. Today I am arguing against nuclear energy. Not just big civilian nuclear power plants. Not just nuclear weapons. Not just nuclear clocks or submarines. I argue that the use of nuclear power in all its forms is morally indefensible.After Lange's awesome speech, New Zealand abolished nuclear weapons. Despite claims by the US that we'd need nuclear power plants, nuclear submarines patrolling our shores, and so on and so forth, we have remained nuclear free to this day [2]. And guess what? We're not facing an energy crisis. Our national defense is far less at risk than that of every single nuclear country. And our people have never regretted the decision.Recently, Germany, a major nuclear nation, said they will move toward doing the same as New Zealand by 2022. So far progress has been good, indicating that it is not beyond the realm of possibility for other large nations to follow our lead.Today, I argue that such a model would be beneficial to the whole world, for one simple moral reason. Every nuclear device, when it generates energy, generates waste that we cannot safely dispose of. Take, for instance, the United States in America. The very latest in nuclear technology. The wisest of scientists and engineers. And yet even they dispose of most of their waste by throwing it to the bottom of swimming pools. Incredulously, some people at the NAS actually bothered to examine whether this was dangerous or not, and their results were exactly as you would expect [3]. Some waste is thrown to the bottom of 'sealed' tunnels, and my opponent's source suggests this is ideal (though they agree it is not what's currently happening due to 'political will'). But consider this - the EPA was recently told, in America, that many of their nuclear deposits could last a million years [4]. No seal can survive that long. Even pure diamond, several meters thick would crack and break, just as all the diamonds from the past million years have cracked and broken. The ground may be stable now, but as it has been unstable in the past million years, so too will it be unstable again.The problem with the waste is that it's radioactive. According to almost every expert, there is no safe level of radioactivity [5]. A Geiger counter only measures how quickly you are approaching your death. We know that miners and plant workers who recieved only mild doses of radiation have died of various cancers [6]. People die from nuclear energy, even when done correctly (mind you, human error doesn't help).Construction costs are rising, construction is taking longer, operational costs are rising [8], and while there are promising next-generation reactors (some of which my opponent mentioned) they should not be legalised for construction until they have been properly scientifically tested. All this is to fund the creation of over 12.3 million kilograms of toxic waste every year, from the United States alone [7]. No renewable energy source has a by-product that dangerous or large. This is immoral, because of the heavy cost in human lives. Just as nuclear weapons are bad because of the immediate cost in human lives, so nuclear power is bad because of the long-term cost in human lives. Never forget that just one month before Chernobyl, the Economist said nuclear power was 'as safe as a chocolate factory.'The danger of nuclear weapons is already well-known. A nuclear power station is nothing more than an extremely slow nuclear weapon, not designed to unleash its power in one explosion, but designed slowly to poison.And now on to con's case.Con gives four reasons why recklessly and dangerously polluting the world is OK. I'll deal with them in reverse order. Jobs, his fourth point, is moot because any jobs lost from not having nuclear might equally be gained from having another power source. So instead of people checking on the safety of nuclear reactors, perhaps they can employ engineers to monitor tidal energy constructions.Thirdly con says we get cheap electricity. The US Department of Energy researched this in their 'Levelized Cost of New Generation Resources in the Annual Energy Outlook 2011'. They found that an advanced nuclear power plant could produce electricity at $109-$124 per megawatt hour. That's cheap - but wind energy was only $81-$115. Geothermal was only $91-$115. Hyrdoelectric was $58-$121. Biomass, still in its infancy, was already just $99-$133. So clearly nuclear is far from the cheapest option! Con's sources are largely from the lobby group 'World Nuclear Association' - in their words, they are 'promoters' and 'supporters' of nuclear energy [9] so not exactly an unbiased group! Their membership is comprised of companies who all have a financial stake in nuclear power [10]. Just because my opponent sources some assertions by this unscientific lobby group doesn't mean their claims hold water. His only other relevant source states 'I’m quite frankly more interested in cheaper solar and fuel cell options, which is where I think the primary future of energy generation is headed (with some supplementation from wind and geothermal)' (emphasis added).Secondly con says nuclear power is safe. I agree completely that nuclear is just as safe as other energy. The only problem is that when a solar panel breaks down, a couple of people moan because the electricity goes out. When a nuclear plant breaks down, the whole planet jumps up and starts screaming. As I've already sourced, nuclear plants are on a trend of becoming more expensive, countering that part of the argument. And his Wikipedia source about workers being competant states there is a serious accident once every 8 years or so. When dealing with things so contaminative, so dangerous, this is completely unacceptable. And con thinks he can hold these things for a million years after they're in the plant without anything ever going wrong! And we can keep making advancements with my exemption for scientific research. Until we know how to properly contain the waste, we should not deal with it.Firstly, con says nuclear energy is cleaner. There is a danger, I think, of environmentalism being confused with climate change. Climate change is one problem - we face MANY more, including a radiation-filled environment which causes cancers and death. So while nuclear emits less CO2 than solar (if you foolishly exclude construction emmissions and refinement emmissions), the point is that they have a wildly different effect on the environment anyway. I believe renewability may be a problem (uranium is a finite resource) but even if nuclear power was totally sustainable, the sustained destruction of our planet and people would be still worse than temporary destruction. And that thing he says about waste being safe and containable... oh look, that's another unsupported assertion from our new favorite lobby group, the World Nuclear Association. Nuclear power is not green.All of con's arguments just don't hold water.Recently the world has been angry at Iran for developing nuclear technology. I think they're right, but the rest of the world shouldn't be so hypocritic about it! Nuclear power is dangerous. I'll continue my case in a moment, once con has had a chance to respond.</t>

    <t>I thank my opponent for a fun debate. To voters, don't think that just because con cited a million lobby groups he has any credibility. He has misquoted and twisted sources, as I have shown, quoted personal opinions of lobby group members as facts, and ignored almost all of my sources. But on to what actually matters in the debate - the arguments:WasteFirst, on solar energy. I've already said solar panels can be safely recycled. My opponent's source is an article detailing how solar companies are setting up recycling programmes. Con also drops pretty much all of my counter-arguments from last round, such as how their quantity is much smaller than nuclear and how we aren't 'throwing out' anything, only REMOVING these dangerous chemicals from the environment and putting them into solar cells.Second, on wind energy. Hey look, it's a new argument in round four! My opponent claims wind is a waste of money. Well, that's much better from a moral perspective than a waste of human lives, which is what nuclear does! My opponent's main source that wind is a waste of money is a letter to the editor of a newspaper expressing an extremist opinion (and the author is the executive director of an organisation sponsored by nuclear lobbyists called 'Great Lakes Wind Truth'). I've already provided evidence that wind is not any more costly than nuclear, and in fact the US government says it's cheaper. The wind lobbyists claim their turbines cost only five cents per kwh (cheaper than coal by a mile!) [1], and I think they'd know better than the nuclear lobbyists. 500 homes is quite a bit considering that most wind farms have hundreds, if not thousands of turbines.Third, my opponent notes radiation occurs with geothermal energy. Wow, more new arguments. That's because geothermal requires an energy input - usually it requires about 1kw for a geothermal plant to generate 5kw. In the USA (con's source is from the US government), this initial current is usually generated with a nuclear reactor. I say - why not do what NZ does, and use hydroelectric or wind to generate that initial 1kw? No radiation is generated as part of the geothermal generation process, and NO byproducts are generated unless it's broken (waste fluid is re-injected back into the Earth).Fourth, hydroelectric. As with wind energy, don't believe con's assertions that it's more expensive. It isn't. Fish population displacement is a problem, so any potential site would need to be evaluated for this purpose to check that fish can still breed etc. Many newer hydroelectric dams have elaborate systems to allow fish to be elevated up and down the dam, circumventing this problem.Next my opponent sources three more lobby-group assertions (seriously, stop quoting World Nuclear!) to boost his sources count. All three assertions I have already countered.It's not just that waste is the main issue. It's the danger that the waste poses to human lives. Con has never specifically addressed this fact. No other industry has so much waste - indeed, no green energy has ANY toxic byproducts from electricity generation. I never said I wanted to ban coal, I said I'm against coal power plants, so my opponent's coal assertions are irrelevant.I didn't drop any of the argument concerning safe waste disposal because it didn't exist. My opponent made no case in round three that it was safe except for a breif assertion that I answered with reference to a scientific study that I had already cited. Regulations do not make waste safe. No regulation can stop a major environmental disaster breaking them open, or the radiation that we KNOW is leaking out. More importantly, no regulation IS doing it. Also I did talk about Lead at the same time as I talked about Mercury - ever used a lead-acid battery, con?And about the economists who don't like solar cells, the Chinese point out that to make the solar panels they use American equipment, and sell them to America so that America can make money off them. It's really a win-win for both countries. Also my opponent confused exports and imports last round. I guess some economists really are stupid... [2]WeaponsMy weapons analogy was not to show that a nuclear power plant behaves like a nuclear weapon. My point was to show that they are the same except one is operating in a controlled fashion. That's not conceeding the debate, or even the argument. Con has never even addressed the point. I'm not referring to a dirty bomb or any explosive device at all. I'm just saying that the same dangerous effects felt by places around a nuclear bomb in ten seconds are felt in places around a nuclear power plant in 1000 years or so.JobsI said in round one that I would not instantly fire all nuclear workers. There are many jobs in decommissioning plants (usually even more than are required for their running), plus there would be jobs in all the other things that would need decommissioning. That would give time for capital investment to flow into the clean energy sector and create the jobs. Nuclear power has created more jobs because they've had more investment - and despite this, wind and solar have had far more new capacity additions [3]. I've already proven that solar is better in terms of job creation (see last round). It's not just that I'm scared. It's that there are tangible harms to me being right, and tangible benefits to following my model even if I'm wrong. More jobs is a tangible benefit of following my model.CostAgain, my opponent shows his ineptitude at reading sources. It doesn't say 67 cents, it says 67 dollars. And it included nuclear power plant tax breaks and subsidies. The study I cited did not include any government market manipulation and was therefore a much better way to evaluate relative costs. It also used a much larger number of data points, using the whole of the USA instead of just California.SafetyI've already provided a source proving that there is NO HARMLESS LEVEL OF RADIATION. Every tiny bit of radiation has some impact. X-rays last a few seconds at most - these people had to live with all that radiation for years! And his only source saying the contrary comes from World Nuclear's spin doctors, not the medical doctors whom I cited. On my opponent's round 2 case, I dealt with that in round 2, and my opponent did not respond - he dropped it, not me.GreenLess pollutants is needed - so why is con supporting a power generation system that creates 12.3 million kilograms of pollutants for his country alone? Preventing climate change is a start, but not polluting other aspects of the environment is part of environmentalism too. Just ask Lucy Lawless and her Arctic buddies. My opponent continuously reasserts that nuclear is safe, but he does so only by citing lobby group articles, when I have cited scientific research showing the opposite. He has given no responses to any of these. I have shown other alternatives (green energy), and that it is not the presence of alternatives that constitutes a ban, but the danger of the waste produced by nuclear. About the CO2 graph, I talked about CO2 in rounds 2 and 3 already, my opponent is still trying to get me to repeat myself.Finally, con claims my arguments are circular. Obviously he does not know what a circular argument is. None of my premises have made it into my conclusions. Anybody who has the vaguest understanding of formal logic will be able to see that. And then to claim that I haven't attempted to counter his refutations shows that he clearly hasn't even read any of my round 2 case and is just making stuff up.It's time that the world woke up to the dangers of nuclear energy. We cannot support a system that creates so much un-necessary waste when there are so many better alternatives available. That's why I'm proud to affirm the motion.Vote pro!Sources1 - goo.gl/0dm6a2 - goo.gl/Ami4W3 - goo.gl/YqHlE</t>

    <t>I thank my opponent for his counter-argument.WasteLet's take a look at the total amount of byproducts produced by various forms of generating energy in the USA:Wind - nothingSolar - nothingTidal - nothingGeothermal - nothingHydroelectric - nothingNuclear - 12.3 million kilograms of toxic wasteSo the idea that nuclear emits less toxic byproducts than other industries is a complete lie. Now, is it safe to produce 12.3 million kilograms of toxic waste per year? You can have all the regulation in the world and it still wouldn't be safe! He claims that the huge metal water-vaults (aka toxic swimming pools) are safe, and yet I've already provided a scientific study showing that they're not. Finally he says that there is a financial incentive for the companies to keep them safe. I agree, but I contend that they cannot be kept safe. The companies are going for short-term profit over long-term environmental protection.I agree that coal isn't a good alternative, but how about not comparing nuclear to other crappy forms of energy, and instead comparing it to good energy? If the motion was for abolishing coal-based power plants then I'd be all for it, but right now let's deal with the topic at hand.Then he says nuclear byproducts are less toxic than solar ones. First, those aren't byproducts of electricity generation, they're construction byproducts. Second, the byproducts we're talking about are things like lead and mercury. They're dangerous if handled frequently, but completely safe inside a cell (like how mercury is safe in thermometers or lead in lead-acid batteries), particulary a cell that isn't handled frequently. If a solar panel ever leaks, it can be simply and safely recycled, unlike radioactive material. It is far safer for mercury to be inside a solar cell than for it to be out there in the environment. Same thing applies to lead. The differences to nuclear are that:1) the byproducts are not byproducts because they are part of the cell, not buried or drowned, and2) there is a much smaller quantity of them than 12.3 million kilograms, and3) enriched, spent uranium isn't a naturally-occuring thing we are removing from the environment, rather we are adding it.That's why nuclear is worse.Finally he talks about China importing the solar cells. Oh no, you're boosting your exports! I doubt you'll find an economist who says that more money for American businesses is bad for the American economy.WeaponizationLet's take a step back. What is a nuclear weapon? Dictionary.com defines it as 'an explosive device whose destructive potential derives from the release of energy that accompanies the splitting or combining of atomic nuclei.' Now what is a nuclear reactor? Dictionary.com gives the very unhelpful answer of 'a reactor', but thefreedictionary.com defines it as 'a device in which a nuclear reaction is maintained and controlled for the production of nuclear energy'. So, the differences are that one is explosive and destructive, and the other is maintained and controlled. Other than that, the two are exactly the same. A reactor is a maintained and controlled bomb. As to required enrichment, it is true that one requires a different critical mass for a nuclear chain reaction compared with just a slow nuclear reaction, but BOTH are harmful to people and the environment. Both solutions are therefore bad.Also, I think the US would be much safer if they were peaceful and stayed out of everybody's way too, but I digress. The point is that nuclear technology is NOT required for a strong national defense - if anything, it just gives foreign countries and terrorists another thing to attack.JobsRemember how I said Germany is getting rid of their power plants? At a time when unemployment in many places, such as almost every single nuclear nation, is at a record high, guess who are enjoying their lowest unemployment rate in two decades? That's right - Germany - with the interviewed economist even noting that 'all available indicators still point to a further improvement of the German labour market' [3]. So why is my opponent so wrong?Firstly he says that solar could only create 10,000 jobs total. If you look at his source, however, he has missed a zero at the end of that number, so it should read 100,000 jobs - and that's not the 'total' jobs, that's just the initial ones, for as it says 'jobs would only go up over a longer period'. He then states that 11% of wind energy jobs are in construction, and 5% are in maintenance. If you look at his source, it doesn't state these percentages anywhere, so he's clearly just making stuff up. I agree that the nuclear industry employs 50,000 people - but when solar energy ALONE, ignoring all the other forms of green energy, will generate 100,000 jobs right from day one if expanded, you bet jobs would boom. Just like they boomed in New Zealand after we banned it, and in Germany after they banned it.CostMy opponent has simply mistaken megawatts for kilowatts. 1 kilowatt = 0.001 megawatts. Bearing this in mind, my source actually estimates the hourly cost of nuclear even cheaper than many of con's sources. And I agree that nuclear is cheaper than fossil fuels. However, green energy remains the cheapest. His source asserting that nuclear energy is the cheapest did not take into account any green energy production, only fossil fuel.SafetyA meltdown is not the only way nuclear energy can break down, so meltdown regulation is a bit of a waste of time. Our favorite lobby group, world nuclear, tells us they try hard to minimise accidents, but the fact is we're still facing a major accident every 8 years or so, despite all these 'newer' designs (by the way, the idea that nuclear is too modern to break down predates Chernobyl by a few decades, and was in that Economist article I talked about last round). Then he cites another lobby-group article saying the accidents are easily controlled, using the example of three-mile island. That's where 40,000 gallons of radioactive waste water was dumped into a river, 140,000 people were evacuated, and $1 billion was spent on the cleanup [1]. That's far from being 'easily contained' - the accident wasn't contained at all! That's the worst accident in the US involving nuclear power plants. The worst involving solar power? Nobody cares what that is, because when solar power fails, there is zero health risk. Same for all the other green energy solutions by the way. And given how long the list of nuclear power plant accidents is [2] (and that's excluding incidents and accidents at the Springfield power plant), I doubt that any level of training will help the situation.GreenAgain, I don't care what emits more CO2. Don't confuse environmentalism with climate change (though my opponent is wrong about the CO2 thing - solar has zero running emmissions, only construction emmissions from mining minerals used in solar cells, but nuclear power plant construction takes longer and emits more). I also don't care about sustainability, which my opponent tries to talk about twice. A sustainable nuclear power plant is a bad thing, because all that while it will be killing you and your descendants, among other harmful effects. On my part, I do worry about that. I worry about it a lot. We don't need to poison ourselves with more radiation. There are other, cheaper, and most importantly, cleaner alternatives available. My opponent continues to ignore this. We don't need nuclear power to save the planet. We don't want nuclear power to pollute us.My opponent's arguments are wrong, his sources are either lobbiests or misquoted, and he has failed to respond to my case. The motion stands.</t>

    <t>~Refutation to the Pros case~It seems as though my opponent seems to worry about the nuclear power being weaponized, and its byproducts. He implies weaponized as he diverges into nuclear weapons, and as I stated in the definitions this debate is about electricity. R1: Weaponization We are not arguing whether or not it is justified to have nuclear weapons, so I assume you mean they may be weaponized therefore need to be banned. This argument is fairly faulty. The technology to actually make uranium enriched enough to be used in weapons is a process that has nothing to do with nuclear power. [1] Further more the plants use techniques with the uranium basically rendering it useless for weaponize techniques. Nuclear fuel it enriched from 3-5%. [2] You need 90% enriched uranium for nuclear weapons. [3] Linking Nuclear weapons to nuclear power is absurd. [1] Also you claim their defense is less at risk. New Zealand is not like the US, they are peaceful and out of the way. [4] Their peace may not be their nuclear abolishment, rather they do not patrol the middle east. R2: WasteMy opponents main case is the waste. He claims the waste is unstoppable and radioactive. Lets refute first his views on the storage. Many plants store them in huge metal vaults (under security big time) filled with water, this keeps the radiation inside. [5] The waste actually overtime becomes non hazardous. [6] The EPA and the NRC constantly regulate and check the disposal to make sure the storage is safe, unlike you claim. [6] Further more my opponent claims a byproduct so 'large'. This is actually false. The Nuclear industry actually emits less byproducts then other industries. [7] The only waste problem that you cite that makes any sense is what the waste is. Also the nuclear industry takes FULL responsibility for their waste is any problem occurs. (like they have to pay for it). [8] Why does this matter? Because they now have a financial reason to keep the storage system safe. Nuclear actually emits less waste then coal. [8, 9] (this ties in next). Methods for Safer underground storage sites are being researched. [8]Then my opponent claims the byproducts from nuclear are the most hazardous. Before we do this, let me cite things about our buddy coal. Well our buddy coal has more radioactive waste then Nuclear. [10] Who would have though that? Well sorry coal, we are not buddies anymore. Now, as I have proven Nuclear waste is stored with great regulation hindering it safe. Now, what about the byproducts from, lets say solar? Some solar cells have many nasty byproducts as well. They use many toxic materials. [11] Now, how is this worse then nuclear? Nuclear Stores the waste in safe facilities, whereas solar cannot store the waste. So in a comparison your argument is false as coal is already more radioactive, and solar has toxic byproducts that are not even stored. Further more (economically speaking) solar has a terrible type of problem: China. China imports most of the solar cells in the US. [12]Also objections to the nuclear power/weapon see above.Defense of my case~ Jobs ~My opponent claims this is false. As I stated the nuclear industry woudl make 3,000 jobs or more per plant. The Solar industry can only make 10,000 new jobs total. [13] In this case Nuclear is better then this green energy. For wind, 11% of the jobs are building the turbine, 5% for maintenance. [14] Why is this significant? Because this means 15% of the jobs wind creates are temporary jobs. The Nuclear business has 56,000 people working for it. banning this energy means 50,000 people lose jobs. [15]~ Cost of nuclear Power ~My opponent claims it costs 109$ per killowatt hour. I disagree:'Since 1987 the cost of producing electricity from has decreased from 3.63 cents per KWHr to 1.68 cents per KWHr in 2004 and plant availability has increased from 67% to over 90%.' [16] 2$ is far off from what you claim! Nuclear Power is cheaper then all of the fossil fuel types, and competes with coal, a very cheap Fossil Fuel. [17] Also this:'The nation’s 103 nuclear reactors were the lowest cost electricity producers of any source of expandable, baseload electricity in 2002.' [18]~ Safety ~'I agree completely that nuclear is just as safe as other energy. '~ My opponentHe basically conceded, and is only saying he is worried of a melt down. The NRC has many rules and regulations so it would be harder for melt-down situations to occur. [19] 'the design and operation of nuclear power plants aims to minimise the likelihood of accidents, and avoid major human consequences when they occur. ' [20]My opponent forgets the only accident recently is fukishima, which could be easily prevented with newer reactors. Chernobyl for example was due to a flawed design. Newer designs and regulations prevent these instances. As these accidents are rare, and when the happen are easily controlled (3 mile island) [21], and therefore your argument is mainly a consesion as these instances are rare and are easily controllable. The workers in these plants have rigorous training and can prevent and be able to stop the incident occurs, and control it if prevention measures fail. [22] ~Green energies~My opponent first goes after the emissions. My opponent concedes they Emmit's less emissions than solar. His counter is the construction. If It emits less then it will eventually even out and bet solar. There are actually methods that make nuclear powers uranium last forever by getting uranium from the sea. [23] So your worry is over... Also as I stated last round, these reactors work on thorium too, therefore will last longer there too. Worry on your part over. *Low on room*ConclusionMy opponent has not fulfilled his BOP (he has it all, 1st round) and in my opinion has no reasons to do with the energy forever. </t>

    <t>~ WASTE ~Waste for SOLAR:Solar panels contain some of the most toxic metals in the business of electricity generation. [1] These modules last about 20 years so when you throw them out you are throwing out potentially toxic waste into the environment. [1]Waste from WIND: Other then the mining involved, the wastes for wind are another story: Money. [2] further more wind power can only power 500 homes per turbine on average. [3] So it is efficient and costly. Nuclear is one of the most efficient power sources. [4]Wastes from GEOTHERMAL:Actually geothermal has some radioactive waste products and emits many poisons gases into the air. [5]Wastes from HYDROELECTRIC: There is a lot of investment needed in hydroelectric costs and evaporate the water and displace local fish populations, and kill others. [6] So, all of his nothing statements are FALSE.'Nuclear wastes are neither particularly hazardous nor hard to manage relative to other toxic industrial wastes.' [7]'The amount of radioactive wastes is very small relative to wastes produced by fossil fuel electricity generation. ' [7]'Nuclear power is the only large-scale energy-producing technology which takes full responsibility for all its wastes and fully costs this into the product. ' [7]Really if waste is the main issue, then most electric industries should be banned, solar, and fossil fuels. If this is a major reason then we might as well say bye to all energy types. Now my opponent wants to ban coal?!?! Coal is a needed ingredient for steel making. [8] Still: If waste is an issue all fossil fuels and solar energies should be banned too. Your reasoning is very circular. Then my opponent talks about mercury. Actually it has lead and other metals that are linked to kidney and lung damage. [9] Solar panels are the FUTURE of toxic waste. Once again if waste is a problem then almost all energy types should be banned. This argument is all fallacious and has very circular reasoning. He drops all of my argument regarding SAFE waste disposal, regulations making it safe, and NRC and EPA checks making it safe. Actually the imports from china Solar cells hurt the US solar company's. [10] I found a whole bunch of economists on my side. Challenge accepted. ~Weapons! YAY! wait...~SPLITTING THE ATOM!!!!! MY opponent basically conceded here. Nuclear plants create nuclear fission which is where we let the atoms decay releasing photons and neutrons. [11] In that case, nuclear power has nothing to do with nuclear weapons, therefore you have basically unknowingly conceded. What you are referring to is known as a dirty bomb. [12] It is pop a grenade off goes the nuclear plant! The only way you can do this is if a crazy gets into the plant, there are many regulations, laws, and training that prevent this. [12] Also you then claim the plant can go boom like bomb, false. There are many barriers inside and outside of plants preventing these radiation leaks. [13]Also:Q. Can a nuclear plant explode like a nuclear weapon?A. ' Absolutely not. A nuclear explosion is impossible in a commercial nuclear power plant. A power plant doesnâ€™t contain the type of fuel in the amount which is needed to make atomic bombs.' [13]Your argument about weaponize is utterly false. Drops my enrichment argument.~jobs!~I seriously think your reasoning is well, a fallacy. Banning the power would mean thousands of people out of a job, and you try to claim it is ok. How? If they are fired they will not instantly get a job again! This reasoning is utterly false. Nuclear power has created new 15,000 jobs in only a few years, and solar only 7000. [14, 15] Nuclear power increases state economic worth and creates more revenues. [14] Even if other energies are better (name one in job creation), Nuclear still deserves to stay, and in my opinion your arguments are all just 'I'm scared, so is Greenpeace, lets ban it' which is kind of a poor argument. ~cost~Um... OK he wants megawatts XD Nuclear in the US costs 67 cents per MWH. [16] On the table its the cheapest one except its tied with geothermal and barely over wind. Need I say more? (dang sources take up all the room... have to be brief). ~Safety~ Lol time for 3 miller! The amount of radiation exposure to people was so small it was harmless. [17] It gave less radiation exposure then an X-ray. [17] 'There were no injuries or adverse health effects from the Three Mile Island accident. ' [18] No accidents, little exposure, it must have been contained to only have this minor effects. He drops the majority of my round 2 case on the subject. ~Green~Emitting less pollutants is needed for a green energy! Preventing climate change is needed for being green. As I stated above Nuclear is actually very efficient (see above). My opponent claims I ignore the radiation. No I have not. I have stated many times how the workers keep it contained, have blocks preventing radiation leaks, and have proven many times that nuclear is safe. Also, you have cited no other single alternatives! Also, alternatives constitute a ban? If so then that is absurd! Macs in many peoples eyes are alternatives to PC's, wanna ban PC's? No. Wanna ban Macs because PC's may be alternatives? NO. The point is having alternatives doesn't constitute a ban, and I have proven the arguments of 'crap radiation!' are false, and well fallacies. All of the arguments presented are circular as you have provided no reasons they are not green except for waste, I refuted this with great facts and you totally act like its not there and claim it is still dangerous. I have refuted all of this, and you have not countered my refutations. I am forced to extend much of my argument from round 3. Here's a pretty graph about polluting! </t>

    <t>A: Uniqueness - Populations are rising. Kates[1]writes: It took the world population millions of years to reach the first billion, then 123 years to get to the second, 33 years to the third, 14 years to the fourth, and 13 years to the fifth billion,The U.N.’s revisedpopulation projection estimated world populationwould swell to 11 billion by 2050. And the availability of drinkable water is decreasing for two reasons: 1 – Climate change is lessening our supply of water. The Arlington Institute[2] states: Climate change is depleting [the] supply of water. As the climate warms, glaciers in the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau have been melting. According to the IPCC, global temperatures have warmed by .76 Celsius over the last 100 years. In subsequent years, there will be less and less glacial meltwater to continuously supply India’s rivers.Nearly 70% of discharge to the River Ganges comes from Nepalese snow-fed rivers,if Himalayan glaciers dry up, so could the Ganges. The Ganges has numerous tributary rivers which supply water to hundreds of millions of people across India. Therefore, if the Ganges even partly dried up, it would have drastic consequences for a huge population. 2 – Government ability to gain drinkable water is failing. The Arlington Institute furthers: India receives an average of 4,000 billion cubic meters of rainfall every year. Unfortunately, only 48% of rainfall ends up in India’s rivers. Due to lack of storage and crumbling infrastructure, only 18% can be utilized. Rainfall is confined to the monsoon season,when India gets 75% of its total annual precipitation. Due to India’s storage crunch the government is unable to store surplus water for the dry season. Such uneven seasonal distribution of rainfall has not stimulated the development of better capturing and storing infrastructure, making water scarcity acritical problem. B: Link – The affirmative claims that everyone ought to have access to water as per their human rights links in because a) it lowers our supply of water to give to other people and b) further causes the population to rise by increasing the quality of life. C: Internal Link – As the population rises in the affirmative world, it causes us to deplete more and more resources, which has the potential to set up a very bad situation. Hance writes:[3] Wealth is dependent on the environment, and our environmentis both finite and increasingly plundered. There is a limited amount of oil, coal, and gold in the world. There is only so far one can push renewable resources. The rise of a global throwaway culture has resulted in an economy based on collapsing environmental capital, creating the ultimate bubble. As more people populate the planet the wealth disparity has been widening. Once our supplies reach a certain limit, and the population reaches a certain size, mass chaos comes from it. Kates 2 writes: Ecologists havecalculated [that] if world population grows to 10 billion people, that will create a “dire situation,” with “catastrophic” health and environmental problems. Birth rates would spiral out of control, and the crowded planet couldn’t continue to efficiently sustain its population, which would consume water at a faster rate than it could be renewed. There are physical limitations to how much food can be grown on the planet’s surface, and the density of a 10-billion person world would be incompatible  D: Impact – Once our world enters a state of water scarcity, it sets up the possibility of wide-spread conflict arising out of the need for water. The Arlington Institute states: More than two billion people worldwide live in regions facing water scarcity. In India this is a particularly acute crisis. Millions of Indianslack access to clean drinking water, and the situation is only getting worse. India’s demand for water is growing at an alarming rate. India’s populationis expected to overtake China’s by 2050 when it reaches1.6 billionputting strain on water resources as the numbergrows. A rapidly growing economy and a large agricultural sector stretch India’s supply of water thinner. Meanwhile, India’s supply of water is rapidly dwindling Climate change is expected to exacerbate the problem causing unpredictable weather, which could drastically diminish the water coming from rainfall and glaciers. As demand for potable water outstrip[s] supply in coming years, India will face a slew of problems, such as food shortages, intrastate, and international conflict. And by conflicts I’m not talking about just a simple skirmish. The conflict that I’m talking about is nuclear war. Klare writes:[4] The[re is an] inadequate capacity of poor countries to cope with the effects of change, and the resulting state collapse, civil war and mass migration. 'More than 300 million people in Africa currently lack access to safe water,' provoking more wars like Darfur. these scenarios use more deadly weapons. As oil and natural gas disappears, more countries will rely on nuclear power to meet their energy needs -- and this 'will accelerate nuclear proliferation as countries develop enrichment capabilities to ensure their national security. Drought, flooding and storms can kill us but so will wars among the survivors over what remains of food, water and shelter.  This impact is going to outweigh because: 1)      The affirmative is trying to save lives by giving everyone access to water, but by doing this they only damn people to death via nuclear war and eventual extinction via nuclear explosions and radiation. 2)      By advocating for the right to access drinking water, the affirmative only violates people’s base right to life in the long run, which prevents them from even accessing a right to drinking water. This case functions in two ways: 1)      It’s an independent reason to negate because I’m saying that by affirming, we violate the ultimate human right to life through causing a nuclear war. By negating, we prevent nuclear war, which solves back for the aff harms of dying from lack of water. 2)      It functions as a case turn to the affirmative because they’re advocating that we distribute water to all people, as per their human rights explicitly stated in the resolution. But I’m telling you that if we did that, we would only further violate their rights in the long run. So as long as I'm winning my side of the case, you have to vote con as I'm sufficiently case turning the entirety of the pro case. To respond to the pro case:  I concede the third point of my opponent's case. Since I'm not attacking the feasibility of giving everyone drinking water, this third point doesn't apply to the debate in any way. To respond to my opponent's two other points, the disadvantage I read functions as a turn to both of these contentions. Since my opponent read no framework, he MUST WIN both points in order to win. In order to win both points, he MUST sufficiently and successfully refute the disadvantage I read, since it functions as a turn to those two contentions.Since I lack characters to go further in depth to my opponent's arguments, I'll conclude here for the round.

    <t>I thank my peer for yet another fine round,  'I would claim that an increase in water would mean an INCREASE in food supplies, since we would have more water to use on things like irrigation and watering of plants and crops. Thus, he's commiting the correlation-causation fallacy. We are observing (or supposedly will observe) an increase in water, according to his sources, but this doesn't link to a decrease in food. If anything, it would cause an increase in available food.'  It has already been stated that an increase in temperature would lead to a decrease in water supply. My peer is correct in stating that an increase in water would aid to agricultural yields, yet that does not account for all factors. If scientists are correct that the planet might very well enter a 'mini ice-age' this would equal a decline in the space of time for crops to grow, thus yielding fewer crops. A period of colder temperatures would also lead to less terrain that would be 'farm able.' During the periods of cold known as ice-ages glacier advance upon lands, and reduces land that would otherwise be available. Warmer temperatures although reducing available freshwater, would not reduce seawater. Does my peer understand that seawater can be used for irrigating crops?  'A British company has created an irrigation system that can grow crops using salt water. The dRHS irrigation system consists of a network of sub-surface pipes, which can be filled with almost any water, whether pure, brackish, salted or polluted. The system can even take most industrial waste-water and use it without the need for a purification process.[1]'  I assure my peer that no correlation/causation fallacy is occurring as my reasoning is sound. Indeed it is quite logical and takes into account a multitude of factors for what climate would be most suitable for producing the highest agricultural yields. While my peers opinion accounts for one, availability of drinking water(freshwater).  'Since this is what he spent the largest part of his last round refuting, the majority of his refutations are thusly de-railed and are fallacious. You can extend out the first two pieces of evidence from the Arlington Institute as the very first place to vote con here, regardless of the other rounds.'  I would request to know how a majority of my refutations are fallacious? I would request my peer not throw around baseless accusations as it only lessens the integrity of the debate itself. Further, I will state that my peers evidence from the Arlington Institute proves nothing except:  A: Climate Change is reducing availability of current freshwater sources B: Governments are not doing a well enough job of obtaining freshwater.  I refuted point A by stating that there is one source unaccounted for, seawater through desalination. Which had the capability of solving the problem of water sources for a very long time. Indeed water makes up 71% of the earths surface, and out of that 71% only 3% of that water is 'freshwater', and this takes the cake here, ONLY .007% OF ALL WATER ON EARTH IS ABLE TO BE USED BY PEOPLE(not counting saltwater of course)[2]. This is water in rivers, aquifers, etc. One only needs to realize that to see that saline water(saltwater) is a solution that would work for generations. Finishing his second piece of evidence has nothing to do with actual availability, if these governments were efficiently storing/obtaining this water, there would conceivably only be a minor problem if one at all. In other words the evidence does not actually refute my argument at all, as it has nothing to do with the actual supply of water(except in stating that governments aren't doing well enough to capture/store available amounts.) Which I will repeat the point made in the previous round,  P4: 'P4: Because we possess the technology/ability to ensure every person has drinking water, we have a moral/ethical responsibility to ensure that every person does, to not would, again, be equivalent to murder.'  I have proven we possess the technology and therefore the means to ensure every person on the planet is afforded drinking water. My evidence has further shown that these solutions would solve the problem for quite a long time in the future, even with increases in population. Therefore disproving my peers claim that, 'The affirmative is trying to save lives by giving everyone access to water, but by doing this they only damn people to death via nuclear war and eventual extinction via nuclear explosions and radiation.' Beyond that my previous refutation that regardless of whether or not water was available to everyone, as well as being scarce or not, a war is likely to occur over another dwindling resource, and therefore we are damned if we do and damned if we dont, does a sufficient job of refuting the basis that a nuclear war is guaranteed if affirmatives position is taken.  My opponent states that his case functions in two ways, '1) It's an independent reason to negate because I'm saying that by affirming, we violate the ultimate human right to life through causing a nuclear war. By negating, we prevent nuclear war, which solves back for the aff harms of dying from lack of water. 2) It functions as a case turn to the affirmative because they're advocating that we distribute water to all people, as per their human rights explicitly stated in the resolution. But I'm telling you that if we did that, we would only further violate their rights in the long run. So as long as I'm winning my side of the case, you have to vote con as I'm sufficiently case turning the entirety of the pro case.'  Indeed so long as you are they would. Lets examine that further though to see if you are. First you have not outright proven that choosing the path of affirmative would result in nuclear war. That is but a hypothetical, a likely hypothetical given the scenario in the evidence. Yet it is entirely dependent upon water actually being a scarce resource. The evidence that I have brought forth shows not only that we possess the means to supply sufficient resources to meet the needs for water, but also shows this next point(notice the framework starting to piece together)  P5: Because we possess the technology and therefore the means to supply the worlds population with sufficient drinking water, to proclaim that drinking water is a 'scarce' resource, is false. Water is not scarce, we as a species simply are not using the tools at our disposal to solve the problems at hand.'  If water is not scarce, any war that would be caused over it would be humanities fault and solely humanities fault on basis of being downright lazy. To possess the means to prevent a catastrophe and not do so(whether its war or billions dying of thirst) is outrageous, morally reprehensible, and sickening.  'B: Link – The affirmative claims that everyone ought to have access to water as per their human rights links in because a) it lowers our supply of water to give to other people and b) further causes the population to rise by increasing the quality of life. C: Internal Link – As the population rises in the affirmative world, it causes us to deplete more and more resources, which has the potential to set up a very bad situation.'  If you insist I shall refute. I will point out that A in the first link is only true if water is scarce, a point I have already shown to be false. B is only a problem if there is no way to prevent population growth, yet the policy of child limits does actually work, and Ill point out that out of any option, its the least reprehensible one, 'China and India will face a triple threat.�Their birth rates have approached total fertility rates that are insufficient to maintain population levels.[3]' Also keep in mind that both China and India's standard of living is increasing, yet population is poised to decrease, thusly disproving causation.  Ahhh my kingdom for more space. Ill finish this next round. Onto you Zaradi. :)</t>

    <t>I thank my peer for such an extensive response.  My peer has made many good points, and I will attempt to refute each in turn. First I cede that the supply of resources in the planet is indeed finite. Yet is drinking water one of those that need be a problem? There is indeed a solution to the dwindling fresh water supply, a solution that is obvious enough. Considering the majority of the earth is composed of water, we need only look at the oceans to solve the problem. Yes, seawater is not drinkable, but it is as such because of its high saline(salt) content. We are able to desalinate water though, and have been doing as such for hundreds, if not thousands of years, 'Desalination/Distillation is one of mankind's earliest forms of water treatment, and it is still a popular treatment solution throughout the world today. In ancient times, many civilizations used this process on their ships to convert sea water into drinking water. Today, desalination plants are used to convert sea water to drinking water on ships and in many arid regions of the world, and to treat water in other areas that is fouled by natural and unnatural contaminants. Distillation is perhaps the one water treatment technology that most completely reduces the widest range of drinking water contaminants.[1]'  This solution as simple of a concept as it is, would require a massive global effort. Yet with the stakes being so high as my peer has stated, it is a step that must be taken. My peer also has falsely stated that by negating water as a right we would prevent a nuclear war. Yet even if we were to take this step, other dwindling resources would cause the same outcome. Therefore the situation has turned into one of, 'damned if we do, damned if we don't.' Logically speaking, whether or not a solution for water is found, another scarce resource, such as food will cause the same outcome.  On the note of climate change, I can only assume my peer realizes that .76 degrees Celsius temperature change within a 100 year period is well within the norm for previous temperature changes in Earths history. Indeed .76 degrees is quite mild as compared to, 'The ice core showed the Northern Hemisphere briefly emerged from the last ice age some 14,700 years ago with a 22-degree-Fahrenheit spike in just 50 years, then plunged back into icy conditions before abruptly warming again about 11,700 years ago.[2]' Yet he is correct in stating that it will affect the worlds freshwater supply negatively. As such we must begin taking steps immediately towards seeking alternative means of freshwater(desalination). The bonus to the warming would be, well, becoming warmer, 'Agriculture in the U.S. and other industrialized countries is expected to be less vulnerable to climate change than agriculture in developing nations, especially in the tropics, where farmers may have a limited ability to adapt. In addition, the effects of climate change on U.S. and world agriculture will depend not only on changing climate conditions, but will also depend on the agricultural sector's ability to adapt through future changes in technology, changes in demand for food, and environmental conditions, such as water availability and soil quality. Management practices, the opportunity to switch management and crop selection from season to season, and technology can help the agricultural sector cope with and adapt to climatic variability and change.' One need only be prepared, and if indeed there were such a catastrophe approaching us, the effort must be global. Also one important factor in this, as the planet becomes warmer, habitable land will increase, think Greenland, and Iceland becoming moderate temperature zones. This will increase available land for agriculture as well. If, and I will stress IF, humanity prepares properly, climate change(warming) could be beneficial. I will state that warming has the possibility of being beneficial, if it were to get colder(a distinct possibility) indeed much colder, think mini ice age, and scientists are saying that it is possible, if not likely, 'The supposed ‘consensus' on man-made global warming is facing an inconvenient challenge after the release of new temperature data showing the planet has not warmed for the past 15 years. The figures suggest that we could even be heading for a mini ice age to rival the 70-year temperature drop that saw frost fairs held on the Thames in the 17th Century. Based on readings from more than 30,000 measuring stations, the data was issued last week without fanfare by the Met Office and the University of East Anglia Climatic Research Unit. It confirms that the rising trend in world temperatures ended in 1997. Meanwhile, leading climate scientists yesterday told The Mail on Sunday that, after emitting unusually high levels of energy throughout the 20th Century, the sun is now heading towards a ‘grand minimum' in its output, threatening cold summers, bitter winters and a shortening of the season available for growing food. Solar output goes through 11-year cycles, with high numbers of sunspots seen at their peak. We are now at what should be the peak of what scientists call ‘Cycle 24' – which is why last week's solar storm resulted in sightings of the aurora borealis further south than usual. But sunspot numbers are running at less than half those seen during cycle peaks in the 20th Century. Analysis by experts at NASA and the University of Arizona – derived from magnetic-field measurements 120,000 miles beneath the sun's surface – suggest that Cycle 25, whose peak is due in 2022, will be a great deal weaker still.[3]' Indeed if this were the case, it would signal an increase in available freshwater from glaciers/snowmelt, but would spell disaster for agriculture, thus shifting the cause of a war from water, to food. Which supports the aforementioned statement, that a nuclear war over resources is likely regardless of whether or not water is scarce. Indeed water is perhaps the one problem that we can easily solve if enough effort is put into it. As we already have to technology to desalinate water in mass quantities, one need only build sufficient facilities to meet the need.  Continuing, my peers point is true, that government ability to secure drinking water is indeed failing. Yet this is not because we do not have the ability to meet the need. It is because there is not enough effort to solve the problem. In terms of survival of a species, need wealth even be necessary to undertake steps to solve problems? It shouldn't, yet sadly it is. This is more of a failing on humanities part, not because we do not posess the means and technology to do so, but rather because we do not see the unnecessary deaths of billions to be an urgent issue that must be solved now. A sad point indeed.  In terms of population growth, again my peer is correct that this poses a serious problem. Yet again it is a problem that can be solved. Indeed it can be done without harming anyone. A limit upon the number of children a couple(or person) can have is a way to solve it. It would not immediately solve the problem but within a couple of generations population would decrease. Think 1 child for every 2 people, and within a 50 year span one could surmise that a 8 billion pop. could become as little as 4, if not even less as not every person has children. I cant say I wholly agree with that solution morally and ethically, but it is a better alternative to a nuclear war.  Finally I will make one additional point,  P4: Because we posess the technology/ability to ensure every person has drinking water, we have a moral/ethical responsibility to ensure that every person does, to not would, again, be equivalent to murder.</t>

    <t>I thank my peer for yet another fine round. This has been quite fun.  'So right now, we can easily call the debate an easy win for the con.' I suppose its a good thing that you are not deciding. Anyways, let us see, can we really? In reference to point A, 'His only main point is to point out that China and India's population are poised to fall.' First off this piece of evidence was used in contention of Link part B and for a support in favor of child limits as a solution to population growth. It had nothing to do with point A. I concede point A. Population is growing, period. Regardless of whether China or India will have a reduction of population, other parts of the world will continue to increase. Eventually the population will reach a point that the planet cannot sustain.  It is only useful in refuting Link part B, and a support in favor of child limits. In this sense this piece of evidence is key, as without it the conclusion that, an increase in quality of life does not equal population growth is not true. Indeed if that were true then the nations with the highest quality of life should have the highest population. This successfully refutes link, 'b) further causes the population to rise by increasing the quality of life.'  Moving on to Link part, 'a) it lowers our supply of water to give to other people.' Of course this is only true if water cant be reused/renewed in any way. Which is not true, distillation and desalination are purification techniques that are completely effective in removing contaminants from water(not just salt). Using the seawater/waste water irrigation techniques water can be used, reused, distilled/purified and drank again. Netting, 0 loss of water. I have two bottles of water, a person uses a bottle, and I gain the bottle back after it is recycled.  'He's conceding the analysis under my link that says by giving people clean water to drink, we prevent deaths from things like dehydration and water pollution, thus increasing our population.' Please refer to china and India example. Also need I seriously address every minute detail of your argument? If quality of life is increasing in these countries(common knowledge will tell you it is) why is the population poised to drop? I will repeat what I stated in the previous round, this disproves causality. As it does this, the link that increased quality of life leads to population growth is negated. Regardless of what your logical deduction states, evidence does not back these assertions. Not to put too fine a point, it is false. As such there is nothing to link the affirmative position to my peers disad argument. Yet even though I no longer am required to respond further to this disad, I will anyways.  As of yet I have not had the chance to address the internal link. If my peer re-examines the previous round he will see that I was in the process of addressing both the link and, 'Internal Link – As the population rises in the affirmative world, it causes us to deplete more and more resources, which has the potential to set up a very bad situation.' Population will rise in the pro and the con world, I do believe Kates 1 proves this quite sufficiently. The internal link does not have sufficient reason to suggest that it will not raise in the con world and will in contrast reduce.  This plays nicely into my impact turn, 'Logically speaking, whether or not a solution for water is found, another scarce resource, such as food will cause the same outcome.' To state this more concisely as there appears to be confusion as to what exactly my arguments have been, Impact Turn: A nuclear war over resources is likely whether or not the affirmative position is taken. My previous damned if we do, damned if we dont statement was just a less abrupt way of putting it.  I of course concede the evidence used by my peer to support the impact turn, as this is the logical outcome of overpopulation as put forth by Kates 1 and 2 as well as Hance. The only part I refuted was that water was one of those problems that would result from Kates 2, indeed I have shown already how water is not scarce, and should not be considered as such. Thus even further removing any connection of the affirmative position to the internal link and the impact. Yet here I will supply more evidence in support of this,  Yes it is true that eventually the population will outgrow the supply of water, but given the techniques presented how long will it be till that will occur. Well considering, there is '326 million trillion gallons(roughly 1.3 billion trillion liters) [1]' of water on earth, and current consumption is, '828,748 billion liters a year,' and that will increase by, '64 billion cubic meters a year[1],' or 64 trillion liters per year, and we begin to see the enormity of the amount of water on earth and how long it would take to reach such a point if all used water were recycled and seawater were desalinated. Thousands of years is an extreme low-ball estimate. This magical 10 billion number may be true for other resources, but for water, its purely nonsense. Yet even more evidence that both turns the internal link, and the impacts connection to the affirmative position.  To tally my argument thus far I have:  1) Turned the link, this alone is reason to vote the affirmative position as my peers disad argument only works if there is a connection between the aff position and the disad. 2) Turned the Internal Link by removing all connection to the affirmative position, 3) Turned the Impact by removing all connection to the affirmative position, as well as proving water is not scarce. 4) Refuted Arlington 1 and 2. The only evidence that supports my peers conclusion that availability of drinking water is decreasing. Was this necessary? No, as both examples are extraneous to my peers argument and are useless. I admit I fell for this distraction ploy and wasted precious space.  Which leaves us with my points: P1: As a necessity for human survival access to drinking water should be ensured for all people. P2: To deny access to drinking water, regardless of reason is equivocal to murder, as without it, a person will die. P3: The feasibility of ensuring all are afforded access to clean drinking water, despite it being extremely difficult does not outweigh the previous two points.  P1 was conceded, yet P2 was not, P2 was refuted under the pretext that to ensure access to drinking water would result in a worse outcome(total extinction via nuclear war) and that pretext was proven false, therefore P2 still stands as valid. P3 was conceded therefore it is true. I further expanded upon these with:  P4: Because we possess the technology/ability to ensure every person has drinking water, we have a moral/ethical responsibility to ensure that every person does, to not would, again, be equivalent to murder. I have proven this to be true, and again the only refutation my peer offered was the same used to refute P2. For the same reasons P2 is valid so is P4.  P5: Because we possess the technology and therefore the means to supply the worlds population with sufficient drinking water, to proclaim that drinking water is a 'scarce' resource, is false. Water is not scarce, we as a species simply are not using the tools at our disposal to solve the problems at hand. This has been proven true in the same way that P4 was proven true.  Finishing, I will say that all of my points lay sufficient groundwork to vote affirmative on the basis that to not would be morally reprehensible on the grounds that it is equivalent to murder. Due to it being morally wrong we have a responsibility to ensure people are provided with the water necessary for survival. That the feasibility of ensuring this supply of water is outweighed by the moral reprehensibility of not. Wealth is never a sufficient reason to take the life of another, never has been, never will. Lastly, that water is not scarce.</t>
<h>    This successfully refutes link, 'b) further causes the population to rise by increasing the quality of life.'  Moving on to Link part, 'a) it lowers our supply of water to give to other people.'</h>

    <t>I thank my opponent for a valiant effort to refute my position. Unfortunately, he just isn't doing enough work to cover every aspect of my case, and thus will be his fatal flaw in the round.Before I go into refuting my opponent's refutations and extending my arguments, I'd like to point out one thing to the voters: my opponent did not extend a single piece of his case. He presents a new point for his case, but this point only further links him into the harms provided by my case. So far as he's not adressing the links to the argument at all, he's still biting straight into the harms, which is the main reason why we can vote con on the resolution right now, regardless of how the rest of the rounds go. Since he still links into the harms, this is going to turn his case, a point that he DID NOT REFUTE in his last round. So as far as I'm winning offense off of my case, it's sufficient to vote con on the resolution.A large portion of my opponent's last round was making a massive non-unique argument on the argument that available drinking water is decreasing, an argument I made in my A point (he didn't implicate his argument as one, but that's basically how he made it to function). Unfortunately for my opponent, he made a poor choice in which argument to spend the entirety of his time refuting, because this is an argument I don't need to win in order to be sufficiently extending offense off of my case. Although I will still refute his arguments, the majority of my time will go to other more important portions of my case. The main problem with my opponent's argument is it commits a massive corrolation-causation fallacy. He is proving that we're going to have an increase in water due to temperature changes from the sun cycle (or something along those lines) but he doesn't warrant as to why an increase in water would mean a decrease in food. I would claim that an increase in water would mean an INCREASE in food supplies, since we would have more water to use on things like irrigation and watering of plants and crops. Thus, he's commiting the corrolation-causation fallacy. We are observing (or supposedly will observe) an increase in water, according to his sources, but this doesn't link to a decrease in food. If anything, it would cause an increase in available food.Since this is what he spent the largest part of his last round refuting, the majority of his refutations are thusly de-railed and are fallacious. You can extend out the first two pieces of evidence from the Arlington Institute as the very first place to vote con here, regardless of the other rounds.  But now I would like to point to the virtually conceded Kates card that talks about an increase in population. Even if you're buying my opponent's refutations and the inherent non-unique made on the availability of water argument, this is still independant of that, thus sufficient for me to extend out as sufficient offense for my case to still link into the harm of nuclear war. All he does is propose to limit child birth to one kid per family, but there are a number of things wrong with this:1) We can look to China and see how this example just flat-out doesn't work. China has this exact policy for population control, yet has the world's largest population. While I don't know the exact reason for the increase in population, the policy that China has implemented hasn't solved a thing. So why would it be any better on a world-wide scale?2) This only further infringes on our rights as human beings to the pursuit of happiness, as families are often happier with more kids. There are very few families with JUST one kid, and forcing them to stop would only cause more unhappiness.3) There's no way to actually enforce this law. People can just have babies anyway and give them to foster homes or other organizations that could look after them. So it would be a pointless policy.4) The only real way to punish those who DO break the rule, if there was a way to enforce the rule, would be to either a) kill the baby when born, which is a MASSIVE rights violation and an outweighing harm to my opponent's case, or b) severely punish those who do give birth, which would only infringe on their rights further. Thusly, the policy he has in mind is an absolutely god-awful idea. As this is the ONLY argument placed against the very first piece of Kates evidence, you can extend this out as the second place to vote con, regardless of the other rounds.  Next, my opponent proposes a solution to the water scarcity crisis: desalinization of water. The only problem with this is he conceded a piece of evidence that directly responds back to this argument. Look to the second piece of Kates evidence under the C point. What this evidence is talking about is once our population reaches a certain level, a whole bunch of bad things start to occur, and we would start to outstrip supplies, like water, far faster than they could ever possibly be replaced. So the proposal to have water salinization, while appearing to be a good idea, won't do much to help us in the long run. So you can extend Kates 2 as the link to the impact.The Hance evidence was entirely conceded in my opponent's last speech. It provides a piece of the internal link to the impact. Since he concedes it, give it the strength of weight. Extend it out, this keeps his case biting into the harms provided in my case.So ultimately, once we start using up water at a faster rate than we could possibly supply it, as the Kates 2 evidence claims, we then reach the third piece of Arlington Institute evidence. This evidence claims that once we have a shortage of available fresh water, we will be facing problems such as intrastate and international conflicts. And these conflicts are nuclear war, as provided by the Klare evidence directly below it. These two cards were entirely unrefuted in my opponent's last speech, so give them the strength of weight. Because of these two arguments, by affirming the resolution my opponent inevitably seals our fate to be that of extinction by nuclear war. In this, you can extend out the two unrefuted reasons why this impact outweighs the impacts given in my opponent's case. By affirming, he a) causes us to all die from nuclear war, which is far worse than some of us dying from lack of clean water, and b) violates our rights to life in the long run, which prevents us from accessing the very rights he is advocating to get. Then extend the turn made at the bottom of the case that the disadvantage functions as. As long as I am sufficiently winning offense on my case, as I proven to you that I most definetely am, then I am effectively turning my opponent's entire position, thus winning the debate. Because of this, there is no other reason to really continue this debate, and you can vote con right now without even paying attention to the rest of the arguments in the following rounds.But overall, I urge a con vote.</t>

    <t>I must appologize to my opponent. He is misinterpreting how my case functions, and is thus still not sufficiently responding to my case. I'll spend a portion of my time here explaining how my case functions, and why his responses are not sufficient.The strucutre of a disadvantage, I will shorten to disad, come in four points (A - Uniqueness, B - Link, C - Internal Link, D - Impact). Each point serves a unique purpose in the case.A - Uniqueness: What things are happening in the real world that allow this case to apply to the resolution and to the aff/pro case. I make two independant points here: an increase in global population (Kates 1) and a decrease in the availability in water we can drink (Arlington Insitute 1/2). While he's covering the second point pretty well, he's just not adequetly covering the first point. If I am winning off of either point, Point A is to be given to con as I am giving a sufficient reason why this applies. So lets go to the arguments against Kates 1:His only main point is to point out that China and India's population are poised to fall. Fine. But the problem with this is my opponent is conceding three arguments I have made that inevitably screw over this argument:1. He's conceding the analyis under my link that says by giving people clean water to drink, we prevent deaths from things like dehydration and water pollution, thus increasing our population. This is logically true because if less people are dying, obviously there will be more people living, thus meaning a higher population. In so far as he has CONCEDED THIS ANALYSIS through all of the rounds so far, this alone is enough to take out this argument.2. He conceded the point I brought up that even if we were to adopt this policy on a world-wide scale, there would be no real way to enforce it adequetly. People could always just have babies behind their governments backs and then drop them off at a shelter for orphans or a place that will take care of them. He hasn't provided a way to enforce this policy, so this is enough to invalidate this argument.3. He conceded the point I brought up that says the only real way we COULD enforce this would be to either a) kill the illegally birthed baby, which is a MASSIVE rights violation, or b) severely punish the mother and father of the illegally birthed baby, which is another rights violation. In so far as the only way to enforce his policy causes more harm than it prevents, this point is refuted.So at this point, Kates 1 can be extended as a sufficient measure to fulfill point A. I don't even need to respond to the arguments against Arlington Institute 1 and 2, since they are independant from Kates 1, and either can fulfill the point A requirement.B - Links. Why my opponent's case links into the harms of the impact. I give two points here. 1: giving other people water reduces our supply of water, and 2: populations will increase because less people will be dying from things like water pollution and dehydration. Both can be logically confirmed. If I have two water bottles and I give somebody one of them, do I still have two water bottles? No, I only have one. So by giving water to other people, we lower the amount of water we have to give to other people. So this is logically true. The second link is also logically true, as I have already pointed out. So either way, my opponent still links into the harms of the impact, which is nuclear war. This was never really refuted, he only tried to point out why it doesn't apply. But I'm showing you exactly how it still applies, so he's still linking in.C - Internal Link. Why the link leads to the impact. This is the most crucial part of my case, and it is the part that has been ENTIRELY CONCEDED throughout this entire debate. This is where the Hance and Kates 2 cards come into play. Hance explains as our population rises, we push our resources further and further, and create a bubble. Once our population gets to large, we pop the metaphorical bubble and we arrive at Kates 2, which talks about once we reach a certain population (specifically 10 billion) people, the metaphorical crap will hit the fan and cause mass chaos. We will begin using our resources much faster than they can be replaced (through natural or artificial means) and things will begin to spiral out of control. This point has been entirely conceded throughout the entirety of the debate, so by affirming he's still leading things to the impact. In so far as he's conceded it for this long in the debate, don't let him start making new arguments against it once he realizes his mistake.D - Impact. This one is the most obvious one, it talks about what will happen and why it matters. This is where the Arlington Institute 3 and Klare cards come into play. As set up by Kates 2, we will begin to rapidly use up all of our natural resources once our population reaches a certain level. Once water, specifically stated in Arlington Institute 3, reaches a low, intrastate and international conflicts will begin to arise over the need for water. This need for water will push countries into nuclear war, as stated by Klare. Once nuclear war starts, massive amounts of death will consume the globe, and nuclear radiation will plunge the world into extinction. Again, this part of my case was ENTIRELY CONCEDED throughout the debate so far. In so far as it's gone conceded for this long in the debate, don't let him start making new arguments against it once he realizes his mistake.So this leads me to why the impact outweighs the pro's claims. I give two reasons for this: 1. By the pro trying to save people's lives by giving them clean water, they only cause them to die through nuclear war and nuclear radiation. So, the pro is effectively failing to prove his case true. 2. By advocating for a right to drinking water, they cause us to lose our right to life, which prevents us to even having a right to drinking water. If we're dead, we can't have water to begin with. So by affirming, he prevents us from having any rights.Then this case functions in two seperate ways, both of which are sufficient for a con vote. 1: It functions sufficiently as a reason on it's own to vote con, since I'm showing you exactly why we ought not value access to water as a human right. 2. It functions as a case turn to my opponent's case, since I'm showing you exactly how, by affirming, he prevents us from having rights in general, much less a right to drinking water. Since I'm sufficiently proving my side true, and my opponent is not doing enough work to disprove my case, I'm winning on both levels of the debate.So right now, we can easily call the debate an easy win for the con.</t>
<h>    I make two independant points here: an increase in global population and a decrease in the availability in water we can drink (Arlington Insitute 1/2).</h>

    <t>I'd like to thank my opponent for two reasons: 1. For taking this debate and allowing me to practice with a case I haven't been able to run in person yet, and 2. For shooting himself not only in the foot, but in the head with the vast amount of concessions he made in his last round. Let's go through and point out what he conceded and what it means in terms of my case, his case, and the round.The first thing he concedes is the Kates card that says that population is growing. This is probably my opponent's worst mistake in the round. This concession implicates against him in a number of ways:1. With this concession, Point A can be extended out and confirmed as offense for me. This means that the link between points A and C still stands strong.2. With this concession, he concedes that in the aff world, the population is rising. This links him into the disad, outweighing his arguments against the link. So point B can also thusly be extended, thus still showing that the aff uniquely causes the impact.Again, he concedes Kates 1. I'm showing you how it implicates in the round and why this screws him over, don't let him stand up in his last round and read off new arguments against it because he already conceded it.Next thing that he concedes is the ENTIRE C point, which is Hance and Kates 2. This is going to be incredibly problematic for my opponent for a number of reasons:1. Hance shows the link between A and D, meaning once our population reaches a certain level, we enter a state of chaos that leads to Kates 2. 2. Since he concedes Kates 2, he's conceding the warrant coming out of Kates 2 that once we reach this population, we will consume water at a faster rate than it could be renewed. This pre-empts his desalinization argument because even if it's true, Kates 2 explains SPECIFICALLY how it will not be enough to sustain us. 3. Since he concedes Kates 2, it concedes the warrant saying that we will consume water faster than it could be replaced. This links STRAIGHT into water scarcity, meaning that if we affirm, we cause water scarcity. This outweighs the arguments against the first link, showing how he's still linking into the disad by affirming. He even goes as far as to ADMIT he conceded this by saying right under it 'Yes it is true that eventually the population will outgrow the supply of water'. HOLD HIM TO THIS CONCESSION.In so far as he's conceded ALL OF THIS EVIDENCE, practially HALF of the warrants in my case, he CAN'T win off of the disad. I'm showing you how the aff UNIQUELY causes the impact of nuclear war. He never made any argument as to why the neg causes this as well, only asserted it. I'm show you specifically how if we affirm, we cause nuclear war. My opponent has no evidence to back up his assertion. My impact still stands and it's the main reason why you're going to vote con. This also means that since the impact still stands, that the disad still functions as a case turn and take-out of my opponent's ENTIRE pro case. So he literally cannot gain any offense off of his case, as I'm showing you why HIS OWN CASE functions as a reason to vote con.At this point, I'd assume that my opponent's 'Oh sh*t' meter is going off in his head right now, once he realizes the gravity of his mistake. He's going to try and stand up in his last round of speaking and read off a massive amount of new reasons why what I'm saying is false and why he doesn't link and why he's not causing the impact. DO NOT LET HIM because a) he's conceding the warrants in my evidence that prove my case true and disproves his case and b) letting him list off a whole list of new arguments in the LAST ROUND of debate is highly abusive and unfair, since I have no ability to respond to it. So at this point, the debate breaks down pretty easily for the voters:1. I'm sufficiently showing why we ought not accept water as a human right, since doing so would cause nuclear war, thus fulfilling my resolution burden. First easy way to vote con.2. Since I'm proving my case true, my case effectively turns the entirety of my opponent's case by showing that by affirming, we not only lose our right to drinking water in the long run, but lose ALL of our rights, not to mention losing our lives. Thus, he can't get any offense off of his case, and he can't win off of it.In so far as he's conceded practically half of the warrants coming out of my case, I've shown you exactly why these two voters are true. Don't let him stand up and spend 8000 characters dumping new responses on my case, since that's highly abusive and unfair to me since I can't respond to them.So at this point, it's a clear win for the con.</t>

    <t>Before I begin I would like to thank Zaradi for starting this debate, and for allowing the maximum 8k character limit as I'm sure it will be necessary at points. Best of luck Zaradi :)  Resolved: Access to drinking water ought to be valued as a human right instead of a commodity.  As pro I will be arguing in support of the resolution and will begin using the following points:  P1: As a necessity for human survival access to drinking water should be ensured for all people. P2: To deny access to drinking water, regardless of reason is equivocal to murder, as without it, a person will die. P3: The feasibility of ensuring all are afforded access to clean drinking water, despite it being extremely difficult does not outweigh the previous two points.  P1: It is a scientific fact that human survival is dependant upon access to drinking water. It is essential for bodily functions. Why is it so important? 'Every cell, tissue and organ in your body needs water to function correctly[1].' Some important functions include maintaining temperature, removing waste, and lubricating joints. However as my previous quote showed, every part is dependent upon water. Indeed water makes up the majority of the parts of the body as well, 'Up to 60% of the human body is water, the brain is composed of 70% water, and the lungs are nearly 90% water. Lean muscle tissue contains about 75% water by weight, as is the brain; body fat contains 10% water and bone has 22% water. About 83% of our blood is water[2]...'  Indeed not having drinking water, even having drinking water but insufficient amounts has negative effects that are seen quickly, 'Dry mouth, the eyes stop making tears, sweating may stop, muscle cramps, nausea and vomiting, heart palpitations, lightheadedness (especially when standing), weakness, and decreased urine output. Also as thee body tries to maintain cardiac output (the amount of blood that is pumped by the heart to the body); and if the amount of fluid in the intravascular space is decreased, the body tries to compensate for this decrease by increasing the heart rate and making blood vessels constrict to try to maintain blood pressure and blood flow to the vital organs of the body. This coping mechanism begins to fail as the level of dehydration increases. With severe dehydration, confusion and weakness will occur as the brain and other body organs receive less blood. Finally, coma, organ failure, and death eventually will occur if the dehydration remains untreated.'  Indeed all these scientific reasons/effects lead nicely into proving my second point, to deny access to drinking water, regardless of reason is equivocal to murder, as without it, a person will die. To further prove my point I will ask the question, 'Does one have to be personally involved in a persons death to be at fault(wholly or partially)?' A reasoned point can be made that by making water a commodity instead of a right that we would all thusly become responsible for every death that results from lack of drinking water.  Lastly, my third point, that the feasibility of ensuring all are afforded drinking water does not outweigh my previous two points. As I am sure not even my peer wishes to be involved in another persons death, either directly or indirectly. As making water a commodity would be equivalent to sentencing those who are unable to afford water to death.  I look forward to my peers arguments. Again, best of luck Zaradi.</t>

    <t>Ill start out this round by thanking my peer for such a fine debate as I have thoroughly enjoyed myself. I will also say that throughout this round I will use different abbreviations that are as follows:  R- Reason D- Round S- Source  Now then, Here is a reason to vote affirmative.  R1- Due to the complete refutation of the Link in my peers disad argument, all conection to the affirmative position was lost, and therefore the disad as a whole is not a valid defense/offense within the context of the debate.  To explain, my peers whole argument is based on the pretext that upon taking the affirmative position, it will 1) Cause population growth 2) Population will grow to a point that the planet cannot sustain. 3)Thusly leading to a Nuclear War over resources.  To prove that the affirmative position causes population growth, thusly linking it to the disadvantage, he states, 'The affirmative claims that everyone ought to have access to water as per their human rights links in because a) it lowers our supply of water to give to other people and b) further causes the population to rise by increasing the quality of life.' This was part B of his argument, the link between my case and the disad. To successfuly refute his argument against the affirmative position one need only break the connection between it, and the con position(disad).  I have done this by refuting both parts of the link, this was necessary because even if one remains valid, the Link has not been sufficiently broken because it still connects my position to the disad. The refutations were:  A: Water can be reused/recycled so to say that by giving water to someone you reduce what can be given to another is false.(D2-S1)Water is not scarce therefore it makes no sense to even bring up this point.(D2-S1/D3-S2/D4-S1amp;2) As even if it were valid, which it is not, water being scarce is a prerequisite of why this point should even matter. B: An increase in quality of life(standard of living) does not equal population growth.(D3-S3)  Indeed my peer for some reason chose not to refute these, even though the Link is the most integral part of the disad within the context of the debate, and chose to focus instead of how i havent refuted other parts of his case. Before I continue I will point out that:  1) I need not refute every single part and the evidence used to support it for the case to be declared invalid within the context of the debate, just the link.(So as to reassure my peer that I am not creating new arguments here and just repeating or rephrasing what I have already said I'll quote) 'As such there is nothing to link the affirmative position to my peers disad argument.' 2) I conceded the evidence NOT the conclusions(Parts A, C, D of the disad) my peer drew from them. A subtle difference but one worth mentioning, as even though the evidence is true it does nothing to support his case so long as the link is invalid. In fact it works against his case too, as population will rise in the pro and con world. As such the impact is not valid as well, given it will occur in both worlds.  Due to my refutation of the link, thus negating the entire disadvantage, my case still stands as the strongest, as there has not been a sufficient defense mounted against it. As such the vote must go pro.  P.S.- This debate really should go to con for these reasons:  R1) Without his assistance in the comments i would not have come to these conclusions. My moral compass cannot allow me to claim victory given this factor. R2) I have misused terminology throughout the entire debate and thusly debased my whole refutation as nonsense, and unintelligable. R3) My peer was not afforded sufficient time to respond to my refutations as to do so he would have had to make new arguments as to why my position still links into the disad as a whole.</t>

    <t>1) First of all, the USA is not a democracy, it is a Republic meaning we have rule by representatives. The majority does NOT rule. The popular vote isn't even the deciding factor in presidential elections so that statement is absolutely false. Let me clarify: the concept of global warming as a man driven catastrophic phenomena is not wildly accepted. Also, since most Americans find the concept to be exaggerated means it is likely that they would be less receptive to a tax increase to combat something not an immediate danger. In 2010 only 28% of people said global warming was a 'top priority' [1]By 2011, global warming didn't even make the polling list. [2] Out of all the public priority polls referenced in the source global warming isn't specifically mentioned even once. Right now the economy dominates the public priority and higher taxes on airline flights falls under the economy and would be damaging, therefore would be extremely unpopular. 2) You're saying to replace reasonable flight distance with train rides. By your own rough calculations (which aren't sourced by the way so I shouldn't even be addressing it, you also broke your own rules here) train takes 3x longer than airline flights. Now, as I pointed out before in my previous argument, an argument you dropped I might add, sometimes flights are needed for immediate travel and this demand will never go away. Many people don't have three days to leisurely travel by train. People have deadlines, need to get back to school, back to work etc. In today's world scrapping flight for a three day train ride makes no logistical sense. 3)The United States' Interstate System is the largest highway system in the world and since the mid 20th century the car has dominated American travel. [3] Transport by train has diminished to almost nothing save for subway travel in a few key cities. Long distance train travel only has 'a few trains a day' [3]. Train travel is cumbersome, slow, non-personal (meaning you can't stop for McDonald's when you want) and inefficient. For train travel to work in the US there would have to be a major rehaul of the transportation system including the addition of high speed rail. But Americans are unresponsive to the idea. The state of Florida proposed a high speed rail between Orlando and Tampa but was popularly vetoed by the governor. [4] It was unanimous within the state government. 4) Math for my ClaimI did a calculation, a simple flight from Jacksonville, FL to Houston, TX for a total distance of 2,632 km. According to this emissions calculator this flight will produce 282.67 Kg of CO2 for one single person. [5] Now, this source says the ideal car emissions would be 120g CO2/km. [6] Since we don't all drive the ideal car I bumped it up reasonably to 200g CO2/km which is reasonable. Now if we do the math. 200g * 2,632km = 526.4 kg CO2. 526gt;282As we can see driving increases CO2 emissions per person. Even if we use the 'ideal benchmark for car emissions' of 120g/km we get this:120g * 2,632km = 315 kg CO2. 315gt;282Now, if we go back to the original number both 526kg and 315kg are larger than 282kg. If we multiply this out by 250 we see the difference grow larger and larger so that the ecological impact of 250 people driving this average flight distance of 2600km is vastly more drastic than one flight. Also, if you see this graphic --gt; [7] you can see that aviation only accounts for 2% of CO2 emissions opposed to the 25% by 'Transportation' which is mostly cars. Even if we bump that 25% down to say 10% (highly unlikely, the majority of that 25 is car emissions) it is still vastly higher than 2% attributed to aviation emission. Cars are simply dirtier for the environment. 5) Like I said in my last argument: people need to fly.Very few people needlessly fly. Flying is essential to a lot of functions of our economy. Businessmen travel a lot and to conduct business and attend business meetings they are required to fly. A father who is on leave from the military and wants to see his family will usually fly from his place of duty. Families traveling to funerals in other states or areas of the country will have to fly to save time and make deadlines. Flying is essential and taxing it more will not reduce demand because people really only fly if they have to. Instead of reducing demand all you will do is put strain on the economy. People who would have a little extra money in their pocket to buy a book or magazine or cool gizmo will now be gone. Savings will be drawn upon to pay the extra price for air tickets. You will be damaging the economy. The price of goods and services will rise because businesses will have to pay more for goods to be shipped and for their business agents to travel. The economy would suffer a huge blow in a similar way that a rise in the price of gas effects it. Reread my argument, you did very little to refute it. The demand for flying in today's world can only go down so much. The rest of the people that need to fly will feel the strain of unneeded financial burden. </t>
<h>    Now, as I pointed out before in my previous argument, an argument you dropped I might add, sometimes flights are needed for immediate travel and this demand will never go away.</h>

    <t>'Changing something in favor o something that isn't wildly accepted is ridiculous. 'Thing is, most Americans (1), 85% to be precise, do beleive that global warming is real. The USA is a democratic country, which means that the majority rule- therefore initiating something due to global warming is not, as you say, 'ridiculous'. Although slightly lower in the UK, (83% beleive in global warming) (2), it is still a majority- and the UK is also a democracy. Just because Americans may think climate change is exagurated, by no means do they beleive it isn't real and that they don't accept it as a concept!So yes, changing something in favour of something which isn't widely accept is unneccesary, thing is- global warming is widely accepted!'Raising Taxes on Airlines Would Push People to Drive 'Yes- if they were flying a driving distance. Assuming that all flights could be replaced by a car drive is ridiculous! What if I wanted to fly from the UK to China, or from Cape Town to Egypt? Although theoretically these flights could be make by car, it would take weeks and people don't have that kind of time! Yes, trains do take longer than flights- but this is just a small sacrifice we need to make. Besides, it doesn't take that much longer! A train from London to Austria takes about 3 days on train and one day on the plane. I'm not saying that trains are the most convenient form of transport out there, but for too long people have been doing what is most convenient, and look what's happening to our planet.'no one is going to take a train instead of flying they would instead turn to the most widely used source of travel in the United States: the car.'Yeah... because when opposed with a car which you have to drive yourself for several weeks and pay seriously high petrol rates for, a faster, cheaper transport which they don't have to drive themselves would NEVER be picked! Please think through these things more carefully, and a survey or poll would be much better than empty opinions about which form of transport people would take. Mine logically makes sense as it is cheaper, faster and less tiring.'According to two sources there are roughly 90,000 flights a day [2] [3] while there are 254 million passanger vehical'' If all 250 or so passangers per flight go back to their cars you haven't done anything to reduce pollution.'You've broken the rule which says all stats and facts must be sourced. If you can show me a calculation that shows me that 250 people travelling by car is more or equally polluting than 250 people travelling by plane, I'd be happy to accept your argument. Until then, your argument is invalid.'By implementing your tax plan people will not only continue to damage your precious environment'See my response to your last quote.'The price of goods and services will rise because businesses will have to pay more for goods to be shipped and for their business agents to travel. 'I apologize for not stating at the beginning, but this debate is about people flying and not flying goods over. Of course you can still argue your 'goods need to be flown' theory as I didn't state this in the acceptance round. I'm not attempting to introduce this as a new rule, just explaining why I'm not rebutting this.'The demand for flying would not really go down because flying is so essential and instead the economy would be damaged for no reason'It is true that flying is sometimes neccesary and cannot be fully replaced, but putting a tax on it will make people consider whether they really need it or not! If they really need it, they should pay the extra price. If they don't want to cough up, they don't need it that much and therefore that flight wasn't that neccesary in the first place.</t>

    <t>First of all I would like to point out that human caused global warming is not an established fact but is merely an idea accpeted by some scientists in the scientific community. So your argument is based around an idea that is not globally accepted nor is it even majority accepted and has been challenged continuously. [1] Why would we raise taxes and change the status quo in favor of something that is not accepted by many people? Half of all Americans think that global warming is exaggerated. [6] Changing something in favor o something that isn't wildly accepted is ridiculous. Can you name one modern species pushed to extinction by 'global warming'?That being said...Raising Taxes on Airlines Would Push People to Drive  You think that raising taxes on the airlines would cause people to ride 'trains' instead or think about flying. This premise is laughable firstly because no one is going to take a train instead of flying they would instead turn to the most widely used source of travel in the United States: the car. According to two sources there are roughly 90,000 flights a day [2] [3]  while there are 254 million passanger vehicals in the United States [4]. These passangers who would choose not to fly would merely go back to driving. If all 250 or so passangers per flight go back to their cars you haven't done anything to reduce pollution. Also; airline travel is the safest form of travel [5] and forcing people out of the planes and into cars will increase the risk of accident and injury due to car crashes. By implementing your tax plan people will not only continue to damage your precious environment but you will be endangering the people as well with increased risk of car accident.People Need to FlyFlying is essential to a lot of functions of our economy. Businessmen travel a lot and to conduct business and attend business meetings they are required to fly.

In conclusion:- Global warming is not universally accepted and changing such massive things as the price of airline tickets for something not wholly accepted as truth is ludicrous- A tax on flying will only lead to an increase in driving which is just as dirty and more dangerous than flying- The demand for flying would not really go down because flying is so essential and instead the economy would be damaged for no reasonTherefore the tax on air travel should not be touched.</t>

    <t>Thank-you.  My first point is that air travel is a major contributor towards global warming and climate change. The emmission contains extremely harmful gases which damage our ozone layer. (3)As much as we can turn off our lights when we leave the room, or always recycle our cans, it is basically all cancelled out by air travel. This article shows some major reasons why we need to help slow down global warming and the effects it is having on our environment. (1) This article shows that, among other things, global warming and climate change is also responsible for a huge amount of species becoming extinct (2) Air travel massively contributes towards climate change, therefore also contributing towards the extinction of species and the destruction of our environment. Should the human race really put the ecological balance of the earth on the brink, just so we can have some quick travel?  My second point, is that having a higher tax on air line tickets will make people stop and think whether they really want to fly. As they becoming increasingly cheap, people buy them usually without weighing out other options such as taking the train. Taxing them higher will encourage people to look at other options which have a lower tax on our environment (no pun intended).  I look forward to your arguments. </t>

Now for the people who buy houses along the beach I believe that they lack in the common sense department. They practically WASTE their money on buying a extremely expensive house along the beach/along cliffs when inevitably the sea walls will erode, or a huge wave might come slamming down on their homes.. Sea walls do not protect against tsunamis, or anything of that nature.  Sea walls are a type of coastal management here are other types of coastal management: Groynes: Are wooden barriers that are built at a right angle to the beach. This absorbs energy which reduces cliff erosion (only one that's not that costly)  Sea Walls: Are walls that are built along the front of cliffs, the often protect land (homes stores ect.). This can cause the erosion of the material at the base of the wall.  Revetments: Wooden barriers built towards the rear of the beaches to protect the base of the cliffs  Rock armor/boulder barriers: Placed along the base of a cliff to absorb energy from waves.  Gabsions: Where rocks and boulders are surrounded in this type of mesh and absorbs the energy from the waves  Off-shore breakwater: Large concrete blocks and boulders located off shore and are use to change the direction of the waves  But will be only debating about sea walls not th other types of coastal management.</t>

I don't see how people who buy houses on the coast are lacking common sense, as with the installation of sea walls they won't be washed away. ' people want to invest in a expensive house that will ineffably be destroyed by the waves.'Seems like you're arguing my side of the debate here... 'we use roads every day, they are a MUCH NEEDED commute system, houses, they are more NEEDED than sea walls' It seems like you haven't understood my point. What I was saying was that even though sea walls are expensive, it is worth it because the cost of repairing roads should a tidal wave occur, is higher. It's like, if someone was going to steal your $1000 car and an alarm system cost $90, it would be illogical to say that getting the alarm system was too costly. I agree that roads are very much needed, which is why we should treasure them and protect them with sea walls.In no way did I state or believe that sea walls should priorotise above roads though. 'once again a sea wall in NOT going to protect against a tsunami!'Agreed.... care to quote a part of my argument that says that the will? I just stated that they would reduce the impact, not stop them completely. ' but, do you really think that sea walls are going protect us from tsunamis?'No I don't.  Check  my response to your previous quote ^.'No they truly don't 'reduce' anything except the budget of the home owners and govt.'.... Reduce the budget of homeowners? How so? Also, like I sad: there is an increasingly huge chance that a tidal wave will occur due to climate change, and if anything will reduce the government's budget it's going to be repairing all that damage! Sea walls are relatively cheap, compared to repairing houses, roads and conpensating families.Also, you didn't really rebut my point about beach traffic, so I guess I've won that clash point!I look forward to your response.</t>

    <t>Rebuttal: 'Over time the wall will erode' Just because something isn't permanent doesn't mean it's not worth installing. Even though hillside forestation isn't permanent, it is still done because it is an effective way to stop avalanches, in the way that sea walls are effective at reducing the impact of tidal waves and tsunamis.  'Costly to maintain' It is even more costly to repair roads, houses, office blocks and compensate families if a tsunami or tidal wave damages a town or part of a city.  'Now this debate is both a problem of people who live on the coast and people such as environmentalists,' Sea walls will reduce busy traffic on beaches, therefore allowing wildlife such as turtles and endangered species in rock pools to thrive.  'Sea walls do not protect against tsunamis, or anything of that nature.' Sea walls do protect against small tidal waves, that is the whole point of them! It also reduces the impact of tsunamis and larger tidal waves, even if they don't toally stop them (1) There have been numerous accounts of towns being protected from tidal waves by sea walls.  With climate change becoming increasingly dangerous, the chance of tidal waves and tsunamis occurring are significantly higher. Sea walls are an investment in our future!</t>

    <t>I believe that this He3 material would not be worth a colonization because if it simply slows cancer all your doing is buying them time for their unstoppable death so why would people buy it to make their lives a bit longer.  Also China and India are no threat to the United States military don't get me wrong the Chinese are strong but the United States has better infantry and commanders Chinese infantry would not stand up to a Marine or Navy Seal or a West point graduate, and India has a no recorded historical of any invasion of another country proving American military might is most likely superior to the Indian forces. As history shows it dose not matter how great your technology and society is if the other guy kills you or at least beats you down. Second China is overflowing with people to the point were they are limiting how many kids they can have which is hurting their farming communities they are to busy juggling their own problems to be a super power.  As for over population the UN believes that the earth could hold another three billion people before it peaks.  I also don't believe the moon could be a stepping stone to mars because I don't believe that we would even be able to build a major city on the moon given the fact that asteroid's are constantly smacking into it and humanity has very little experience with space travel trying to build a nasa base on a unstable piece of land would be very risky.</t>

Hegemony, the United States needs to keep being a world power and if we don't colonize the moon first China or India will and surpass us as a world power. 3. steping stone to Mars. 4.

    <t>1. I still find moon colonization as over doing it for a single resource unless this thing will shoot so far into the technological future that it will cure aids cancer and make us immortal than not really worth it.  2. I also fail to see the evidence of India as a threat sure they have the weapons but they have no motive to use them and no one on the earth wants to pick a nuke fight with the winners of the cold war. As for China whoopdy dooo they have a smart computer I'll be concerned when it picks up a weapon and starts commanding armies until then its no concern.  3. My point stands that the moon's colonization would be more costly than profitable not just in resources but in human lives no matter what frontier it is people die wether it is Egypt taking the Sahara Rome in Germania and England the Pilgrims coming to America the Pioneers moving west many lives were lost in all of them and this is a new frontier its not building a new city in a far away land its not sailing across the ocean to a new place its leaving our planet for the first time to an unstable are lives will be lost many of them and Humanity dose not have the can do spirit as much anymore we took Earth we colonized every last bit of it with our blood sweet and tears and since Humanity put that flag in that one little piece of unclaimed land our want to explore and to die for knowledge. I don't think the moon a rock flouting around in space is worth the hundreds maybe even thousands of human lives lost in the process of taking it.</t>

    <t>I cut and pasted a couple of passages from the NCPA website because I didn't want to write all the evidence in my head.  Current research suggests that coastal stations in Greenland are experiencing a cooling trend, and average summer air temperatures at the summit of the Greenland Ice Sheet have decreased at the rate of 4°F per decade since measurements began in 1987.   Is Warming Causing Sea Ice to Melt? According to the Arctic Assessment , human-caused warming in the Arctic will necessarily lead to decreased sea ice thickness and extent. However, air temperature is only one factor that influences sea ice; the frequency and velocity of the wind also has an effect. When the Arctic is relatively calm, it is easier for sea ice to develop. During stormy periods, surface winds churn the water and move existing ice, making it more difficult for sea ice to form.   A study commissioned by Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans examined the relationship between air temperature and sea ice and concluded, "the possible impact of global warming appears to play a minor role in changes to Arctic sea ice." Rather, the Canadian study found that changing wind patterns are the primary cause of changing sea ice distributions. Moreover, while sea ice has decreased in the Arctic, it has remained relatively constant (or even increased slightly) in the Antarctic since 1978.  Is Global Warming Killing Polar Bears? The Arctic Assessment concludes, "global warming could cause polar bears to go extinct by the end of the century by eroding the sea ice that sustains them." According to the assessment, the threat to polar bears is threefold: Changes in rainfall or snowfall amounts or patterns could affect the ability of seals, the bears' primary prey, to successfully reproduce and raise their pups; decreased sea ice could result in a greater number of polar bears drowning or living more on land, negatively affecting their diet (forcing them to rely on their fat stores prior to hibernation); and unusual warm spells could cause the collapse of winter dens or force more bears into less-desirable denning areas.   Though polar bears are uniquely adapted to the Arctic region, they are not wedded solely to its coldest parts nor are they restricted to a specific Arctic diet. Aside from a variety of seals, they eat fish, kelp, caribou, ducks, sea birds and scavenged whale and walrus carcasses. In addition, as discussed above, Arctic air temperatures were as high as present temperatures in the 1930s and polar bears survived.   Moreover, when the WWF report is compared with the Arctic air temperature trend studies discussed earlier, there is a strong positive (instead of negative) correlation between air temperature and polar bear populations. Polar bear populations are declining in regions (like Baffin Bay) that have experienced a decrease in air temperature, while areas where polar bear populations are increasing (near the Bering Strait and the Chukchi Sea) are associated with increasing air temperatures. Thus it is difficult to argue that rising air temperatures will necessarily and directly lead to a decrease in polar bear populations.</t>

If we are chucking out tons of  those gases a day into the atmosphere I think we can safely say that Global Warming is almost certainly caused by us. It's not been over exaggerated.
