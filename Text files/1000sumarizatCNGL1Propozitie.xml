    <t>There is so much on this issue I don't know what to explain first.  Fact 1: There has been no significant atmospheric warming since 1998. In addition to this, there has been a lack of an atmospheric hotspot (in the mid to upper troposphere) that was predicted to be caused by greenhouse gas caused warming. This in itself proves that greenhouse gasses are not causing the recent warming trend. No warming 1: No warming 2: Lack of hotspot 1: https://mises.org... Lack of hotspot 2: (Specifically on pg 6 but I suggest you read more)  Fact 2: Co2 is an extraordinarily weak greenhouse gas. According to atomic absorption spectroscopy, it can only store and release 7% of the electromagnetic spectrum that passes through it.  Fact 3: Throughout Earths history, Co2 has been much higher in the past showing that recent levels of Co2 are harmless. Fact 4: Recently, ice core data shows that Co2 followed temperature, sometimes by hundreds of years, not the other way around. Lags warming 1: https://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com... Lags warming 2: Fact 5: Co2 has never caused amplification of warming in the past. It is simple logic. If Co2 amplified temperature after orbital changes raised the temperature first, when would the amplification stop? The answer is when there is no more Co2 in the oceans. This would cause the oceans to become abnormally basic and this has only happened once in the last 25 million years: Ocean pH 25 million years: https://www.manicore.com... (I know it shows acidification at the end but this does not contradict my argument because it is a different result of more Co2.)  Fact 6: Almost every single computer model made by the IPCC is wrong. This suggests something fundamentally wrong with the models used. In addition, the models are all wrong because they predict to much heat which suggests that the effect of Co2 is being overblown. Computer models wrong 1: https://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com... Computer models wrong 2: Fact 7: The Earth has been warming for 15000 (or 
0) years. Warming for 15000 (or 20000 it depends on the data) years:  Fact 8: In the last 8000 years, we have had 4 major global warm periods naturally. We had the medieval warm period, the roman warm period, the Minoan warm period and the Holocene maximum. All major warm periods: Medieval warm period was global 1:  Medieval warm period was global 2:  Fact 9: All major planet bodies in our solar system are experiencing rapid climate change, indicating that the heating on Earth could be caused by something in the solar system, not the planet.  Mars: Ice caps are shrinking, two pictures showed possible warming (these could be unreliable due to dust storms), atmosphere is gaining clouds, ozone and water vapor (indicating warming).  Pluto: Mysterious dark spots are becoming larger, atmospheric pressure increased by 300% (indicating warming)  Saturn: Giving off x-rays, growing storm spots and other hot spots in its atmosphere (indicating warming)  Uranus: Polar shifts, 2 large storms spots that were not there 50 years ago (indicating warming)  Mercury: Gaining a magnetic field, polar ice caps growing (indicating cooling)  Jupiter: Plasma clouds merging together and growing new storm spots (indicating an 18 degree Celsius warming)  Venus: 2500% increase in green glow indicating more oxygen in its atmosphere  Neptune: Weird changes in light intensity.  Earth: Rapid warming  As you can see, every major planet in our solar system is experiencing rapid climate change. Scientists theorize that this is due to increased amounts of energy in the space around our solar system.  Fact 10: There is no scientific way to test whether Co2 causes global warming. Yes, Co2 is a greenhouse gas and traps warmth, I am not denying that. What we haven't tested is whether this warmth has a great enough impact to trump all other factors that influence climate. For example, ocean currents, cosmic rays, sun irradiance, the sun spot cycle, Earth's magnetic field, Earth's orbit, Earth's tilt, Volcanos, etc' all effect the climate. Why is Co2 more important than all of these factors? Let's find out! Oh, wait, you can't. This is where you reach a problem. How do you find out? You can't, scientifically, create a real, controlled experiment to test whether Co2 has a bigger impact than any of these other factors. This means that the entire idea that Co2 causes climate change is based on computer models and it can't actually be tested. This shows that the idea that Co2 causes warming is less science then it is religion because you are putting your faith in a computer model rather than observing and recording data. Keep in mind that simple correlations do not qualify as scientific data.  Fact 11: During the post economic boom, when Co2 soared, temperatures fell despite the increase in Co2. This has been blamed on increased sulfur emissions but NASA says, 'the cooling effect of the pollution aerosols will be somewhat regionally dependent, near and downwind of industrial areas' which explains how sulfur would only cause cooling in or around the areas it was released. This means that sulfur could not be responsible for the cooling. Post war economic boom: Co2 levels: https://www3.epa.gov... As you can see, Co2 levels rose dramatically during the post economic boom, past what they had ever been at before, yet temperatures fell.  In conclusion, I have provided 11 facts explaining how Co2 can not, or has never been, a main climate driver. All the historical and recent evidence is stacked against it. While my opponent gives links to a consensus and impacts of possible warming, I have focused on the argument at hand. Explaining why Co2 does not drive climate. While my opponent has made little to no argument, I have shown why the conclusions of the scientists in the consensus he listed were wrong.

<t>    By just comparing a station to itself, and only looking at the stations delta from hits own average we can show that the abrupt change around 1900 was actually an illusion caused by a large number of stations following a similar methodology, and not an actual change in temperature.We can see in Figure 8 that the change is more gradual like the low temperature in Figure 7. The disagreement between the two graphs implies that the change is due to method changes, and not due to real changes.Figure 8: All GHCN Station High Temperature Average DeltaFigure 9: All GHCN Station Low Temperature Average DeltaIt would be an error to accept either Figure 7 or 8 as the truth.

<t>    Yes I agree that the Earths temperature is rising, that is no secret.I just do not belive that global warming is the reason why.My six propositions of alternate climate change are,The bio-thermostat theorem- that the co2 being placed in the atmosphere is causing natural changes in the output/input of carbon dioxide in plants and animals such as algea, also another possible theorem to add to this is the increasing birth rate of cows, who can produce enought carbon dioxide and methane to fill up a jar the size of Rhode island, source, animals.howstuffworks.com/cowscarbon.More alternate theories of climate change is the albedo and cloud fromation, this one is short, chnages in the formation of albedo clouds can create a negative feedbacks that cancel out all or nearly all of warming effect of higher level of co2.-humans forcing the greenhouse effect alternate to greenhouse gases, that the greatest influence on climate is the transformation of Earths surface, like the creating of deserts and the cutting of the rainforests.-ocean currents, natural changes in the Earths mantle is cause the current of the oceans to move at different speeds or chnage direction all together, the theory states how the natural process of algea is being adapted to the new formation of currents and is a prime factor in the realese of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.-Planetary motion, natural gravitational and magnetic oscillations of the solar system induced by the planets movement through space can dribe climate change and naturaly effect the Earths magnetic field.-Solar variability - changes in the coronal ejections and magnetic fields of the sun causes changes in the cloud formation, ocean currents, and win that can cause climate change.This is just a note not a arguement: At first, people where afraid that the earth was going to be placed in another iceage because of Co2 not in a rising temperature.

All evidence in the fisheries advantage come from one single study 2.)    This study is in support of mineral accretion reefs to help fisheries 3.)    Thus the writer of those very lines disagrees that it is too late for ANY recovery, he has simply said that HALTING FISHING WOULD NOT BRING BACK ENOUGH FISH TO SAVE THE INDUSTY and other measure are neccesary 4.)    He then concludes in my solvency evidence that only mineral accretion coral reefs offer the solution to the problem which can help and revitalize the fishing industry and thus save millions of dollars   1.)    Even if this advantage is wrong, you have conceded the health advantages and the shoreline advantages are also still in play 2.)

<t>    This study showed that an average 2,000 kcal high-meat diet has 2.5 times as many greenhouse gas emissions as an average vegan diet. [5] The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has also said that raising animals for food--including land used for grazing and land used to grow feed crops for farmed animals--now uses a staggering 30% of the Earth's land mass. According to Greenpeace, nearly 80% of land deforested in the Amazon is now used as cattle pasture.

I wanted to say that, planting excess trees and turning cities into forests is not at all a good practice.* Relationship Between Animals (wild) and Humans : In this case, animals are considered to be wild. www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIrs_ZXXiLc (it's a You tube Video, though it states my point through a visual approach).

Marx, whose orientation was largely materialist and historicist (influenced by conditions and inherent processes beyond the control of humans), framed his analysis around four central points: 1) the physical reality of people, 2) the organization of social relations, 3) the value of the historical context of development, and 4) the human nature of continuous praxis [anthropology.ua.edu/cultures/cultures] (Marx had to study history to locate an original accumulation as an external starting point of capital -- which is an interesting point I hope we will have time to get back to in later rounds).But let me ask you a series of questions for contrast and to elucidate a point further: Did communist groups throughout history ever cut down trees in excess and accumulate a resource-surplus?

Environmental Crises in the US The United States rests atop one of the most diverse ecological regions on the planet, and includes arctic tundra, mountains, plains, coastal regions, forests, swamps, deserts and dense urban areas.
There are several serious ecological disasters and crises that are currently underway in America, or that present a serious risk.
500 Mountains in America's Appalachians have been destroyed by Mountaintop Removal coal mining.
Google Maps Coordinates, showing deforestation' /gt;37.800832,-81.841133 Google Maps Coordinates, showing Massive deforestation Perhaps most horrifying, the human toll is almost unimaginable. We produce 17.28 metric tons of carbon emissions each year in the US.Con points out that many environmental protections have been implemented, and many successful strategies have been implemented to address the dangers caused by over-consumption and the use of fossil fuels. This political control has given rise to the astonishing practice of Mountaintop Removal coal mining. Each of these environments requires a delicate equilibrium in order to maintain it's continued existence, and many of them face unique challenges and potential crises. Overpopulation The US population crossed the 100 million mark as recently as 1915, and has tripled since then.
[8] I am sure that Con will deny that any of these environmental disasters are actually happening. This is Jarrell Cemetery, surrounded on all sides by mining operations. Unlike most European nations, the US population continues to grow rapidly, and will become unsustainable within 100 years, Carbon Emissions Although Con points to improvements in the amount of carbon emissions that are pumped into our air each year, the US remains the world largest polluter of carbon emissions.
Every other resident has been bought out by the coal company, Alpha Natural Resourses (formerly Massey Energy.
What is Mountaintop Removal?Put simply, Mountaintop Removal mining automates the process of coal mining, replacing workers with high explosives.
[4] Conservative estimates of the dollar cost related to premature Mountaintop Removal coal mining from all causes is $42 billion annually.
Roger and his mother Quinnie are the last remaining residents of Lindytown, West Virginia.
Several towns have been erased, and the coal industry is being wiped out - along with the careers and traditions that go along with it.
Above: Areas where Mountaintop Removal mining operations are occurring have the highest rates of cancer deaths in the entire United States.

    <t>yes Good reason, no, simple, stupid, oversight. Design = creation. Accident = evolution. Reason.
So in fact I had actually written my round 3, simply neglected to actually submit it it. I talked about complexity of design, indicating design rather than accident, and therefore indicating a designer, someone who organised the appearance of everything we see.
I really don't see any way of making it more complex than that. I had I admit forgotten it in all that is happening in my life at the moment, but when I went to post my 'round 4' what did I find? I found the text below ready and waiting for me.
To me it is very simple, things either happen by accident, or they happen by design.
The Earth has undergone many cataclysmic changes in its history. Again, to me the way our Creator works is extremely logical.' Again I apologise for my oversight. This does backup the idea of diet triggering adaptation within a kind, or what was once referred to as a species before the meaning of the word species was expanded.
To me all of this helps prove the truth of Scripture, and therefore the creation account, which if true can also only be the most logical explanation of how we got here. Again I apologise. There are also, or have been, a number of theories of evolution, but the whole basis of evolution is that it simply happened will stop no creator, because that means God and most evolutionists will tell you that God doesn't exist, it just happened.Our highly intelligent designer, has as I said earlier simply employed a great economy of design.
And when you stop to think that one of the things which humanity shares many of its DNA characteristics with is a banana, all that demonstrates is intelligent economy of design. Of course there are various understandings of what creation means many of them depending on only a very brief reading of Genesis without any real consideration of what it is saying.</t>

    <t>Design = creation.' Accident = evolution. 'To me it is very simple, things either happen by accident, or they happen by design. Allow me to narrow this down a bit further: '...design, indicating design'. I would ask my opponent to see my refute in round 2 to show this. My opponent, despite my refute in round 2 (which he appears to have ignored), is still making an appeal to ignorance fallacy by stating that evolution occurs through accident alone. My opponent's first statements are: 'I have to admit I am very curious to try and understand what alternatives there are in the creation versus evolution debate. Now, onto my opponent's arguments! 'I talked about complexity of design, indicating design rather than accident, and therefore indicating a designer, someone who organised the appearance of everything we see.'
In fact creationism makes no predictions whatever about the distribution of fossils.
The Theory of Evolution in itself doesn't try to explain where life came from, which is what [the ToE] I'm defending.
I thank my opponent for his arguments and apology; I accept the apology. My opponent appears to be saying that if DNA doesn't mutate then children cannot 'take place' [be born/conceived] because the DNA wouldn't be able to change.It does not. 'One thing my opponent appears to forget is that evolution is based on theories such as that expressed by Darwin which attempt to explain where life came from.'
It's satisfying to know that creation doesn't object to natural selection; but my opponent appears to be using this as proof for a Creator.
'The Earth has undergone many cataclysmic changes in its history.
'Creation, as described in Scripture merely explains the reason for that ability to adapt.'
For example, uranium decay, carbon dating, argon-argon dating, fission track dating helium, iodine-xenon, lanthanum-barium, lead-lead, neon-neon etc... 'Creation has no argument with DNA being able to adapt, though I do object to the use of the word mutate, because if DNA could not do that the birth of a child could never take place will stop since DNA changes every time a different type of cell needs to be formed to create that complex structure which is the human body.' I need not make a refute when no logical claim has been made. As he has not even attempted to refute it, merely ignore it; I extend my refute for that. It's true, however, that now the theory is being applied to try to explain how life originated (or 'came from', as my opponent puts it). This fits in with the geologically proved fact that the Earth was originally a single continent, and the geological layers were once flat, but are now tilted at various angles.
Creation has no argument with DNA being able to adapt, though I do object to the use of the word mutate, because if DNA could not do that [mutate, then] the birth of a child ((could never take place)) will stop since DNA changes every time a different type of cells needs to be formed to create that complex structure which is the human body.''
However, based on my round 2 and my opponents first claim, I need not do anything as it shouldn't affect the voting or debate in any way.
My point from round one, therefore, stands; that my opponent attempting to debunk evolution will not strengthen his position whatsoever.
So, this is like me making a fire truck that 'makes no predictions on how to tackle fires'. 'As for 'natural selection' creation has no objection to that either, because all [it] laterally describes is the process which the creator built into every creature to allow it to change to fit the circumstances it finds itself in. I need not refute this. ' </t>

    <t>Is Deforestation really a problem? This means that the forest population could last around 88.8 years.
The UN now plants 1.7 billion trees a year 12 billion total. According to NASA, there are 400 billion trees in the world.
Deforestation would be a problem if it weren't being solved, but it is.The world deforests what amounts to 4.5 billion trees a year (I averaged between 3-6 billion. According to the UNEP Billion Trees Program, all the trees grown under the UN program equaled 2 billion in 18 months after launch. If you leave out Water Vapor.Does Water Vapor really effect Global Warming?
We are in the Global Warming period of the cycle. You see, Urbanized areas (Cities, Towns, Villages) take up 3% of Earth's land...(12,13) If all of the Urban Areas was, by some odd chance, on Arable land, it would cover 28.76% of all Arable Land. Human's responsible for 3.6% of all CO2 emissions. Total number of plants planted would include this amount + all the other Replacement programs.
Argument starts now.-Deforestation.Deforestation verb: To cut down and clear away the trees or forests from. What defines a problem is that it can't, or isn't, being solved. Most companies that deforest have a Replacement Program, obviously they aim to keep their product growing.
After adding this gas in, with it's tiny GWP, it has a maasive effect on human's total effect on the Greenhouse Effect.How much?
The US alone plants 1.5 billion trees a year from nurseries alone.
This number also does not include the trees regrown in corporate Replacement programs, or volunteer programs.
With only 0.28% of the total Greenhouse effect, human's are responsible for raising temperatures 0.003*F over the past century.With this, I conclude that Human's have not overpopulated the Earth.</t>

'Ninety-seven percent of climate scientists agree that climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities, and most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position' 'All three major global surface temperature reconstructions show that Earth has warmed since 1880.5 Most of this warming has occurred since the 1970s, with the 20 warmest years having occurred since 1981 and with all 10 of the warmest years occurring in the past 12 years.6 Even though the 2000s witnessed a solar output decline resulting in an unusually deep solar minimum in 2007-2009, surface temperatures continue to increase'  Emission Scenarios (SRES), by the end of the 21st century, we could expect to see carbon dioxide concentrations of anywhere from 490 to 1260 ppm (75-350% above the pre-industrial concentration).

<t>    The issue of who is responsible for climate change is thus irrelevant.Re: 'Contention 3'My opponent argues that 'nations are not moral entities,' so therefore the 'idea that a country would have a 'moral obligation' is unethical on the basis of Ethical Relativism.' The argument is not only entirely incoherent (how can something be objectively 'unethical' on the basis of 'Ethical Relativism'?), but its premises are flat-out wrong.The problem is that my opponent confuses descriptive ethics with normative ethics, taking the existence of different moral views (it is true that different individuals, cultures, and countries can have different moral doctrines) to establish the lack of a true morality that 'nation-states ought to abide by.' Just because a particular individual or nation believes their moral view is the right one does not make it right.
