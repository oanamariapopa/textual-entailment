    <t>There is so much on this issue I don't know what to explain first.  Fact 1: There has been no significant atmospheric warming since 1998. In addition to this, there has been a lack of an atmospheric hotspot (in the mid to upper troposphere) that was predicted to be caused by greenhouse gas caused warming. This in itself proves that greenhouse gasses are not causing the recent warming trend. No warming 1: No warming 2: Lack of hotspot 1: Lack of hotspot 2: (Specifically on pg 6 but I suggest you read more)  Fact 2: Co2 is an extraordinarily weak greenhouse gas. According to atomic absorption spectroscopy, it can only store and release 7% of the electromagnetic spectrum that passes through it.  Fact 3: Throughout Earths history, Co2 has been much higher in the past showing that recent levels of Co2 are harmless. Fact 4: Recently, ice core data shows that Co2 followed temperature, sometimes by hundreds of years, not the other way around. Lags warming 1: Lags warming 2: Fact 5: Co2 has never caused amplification of warming in the past. It is simple logic. If Co2 amplified temperature after orbital changes raised the temperature first, when would the amplification stop? The answer is when there is no more Co2 in the oceans. This would cause the oceans to become abnormally basic and this has only happened once in the last 25 million years: Ocean pH 25 million years:(I know it shows acidification at the end but this does not contradict my argument because it is a different result of more Co2.)  Fact 6: Almost every single computer model made by the IPCC is wrong. This suggests something fundamentally wrong with the models used. In addition, the models are all wrong because they predict to much heat which suggests that the effect of Co2 is being overblown. Computer models wrong 1: Computer models wrong 2: Fact 7: The Earth has been warming for 15000 years. Warming for 15000 (or 20000 it depends on the data) years:  Fact 8: In the last 8000 years, we have had 4 major global warm periods naturally. We had the medieval warm period, the roman warm period, the Minoan warm period and the Holocene maximum. All major warm periods: Medieval warm period was global 1:  Medieval warm period was global 2:  Fact 9: All major planet bodies in our solar system are experiencing rapid climate change, indicating that the heating on Earth could be caused by something in the solar system, not the planet.  Mars: Ice caps are shrinking, two pictures showed possible warming (these could be unreliable due to dust storms), atmosphere is gaining clouds, ozone and water vapor (indicating warming).  Pluto: Mysterious dark spots are becoming larger, atmospheric pressure increased by 300% (indicating warming)  Saturn: Giving off x-rays, growing storm spots and other hot spots in its atmosphere (indicating warming)  Uranus: Polar shifts, 2 large storms spots that were not there 50 years ago (indicating warming)  Mercury: Gaining a magnetic field, polar ice caps growing (indicating cooling)  Jupiter: Plasma clouds merging together and growing new storm spots (indicating an 18 degree Celsius warming)  Venus: 2500% increase in green glow indicating more oxygen in its atmosphere  Neptune: Weird changes in light intensity.  Earth: Rapid warming  As you can see, every major planet in our solar system is experiencing rapid climate change. Scientists theorize that this is due to increased amounts of energy in the space around our solar system.  Fact 10: There is no scientific way to test whether Co2 causes global warming. Yes, Co2 is a greenhouse gas and traps warmth, I am not denying that. What we haven't tested is whether this warmth has a great enough impact to trump all other factors that influence climate. For example, ocean currents, cosmic rays, sun irradiance, the sun spot cycle, Earth's magnetic field, Earth's orbit, Earth's tilt, Volcanos, etc' all effect the climate. Why is Co2 more important than all of these factors? Let's find out! Oh, wait, you can't. This is where you reach a problem. How do you find out? You can't, scientifically, create a real, controlled experiment to test whether Co2 has a bigger impact than any of these other factors. This means that the entire idea that Co2 causes climate change is based on computer models and it can't actually be tested. This shows that the idea that Co2 causes warming is less science then it is religion because you are putting your faith in a computer model rather than observing and recording data. Keep in mind that simple correlations do not qualify as scientific data.  Fact 11: During the post economic boom, when Co2 soared, temperatures fell despite the increase in Co2. This has been blamed on increased sulfur emissions but NASA says, 'the cooling effect of the pollution aerosols will be somewhat regionally dependent, near and downwind of industrial areas' which explains how sulfur would only cause cooling in or around the areas it was released. This means that sulfur could not be responsible for the cooling. Post war economic boom: Co2 levels. As you can see, Co2 levels rose dramatically during the post economic boom, past what they had ever been at before, yet temperatures fell.  In conclusion, I have provided 11 facts explaining how Co2 can not, or has never been, a main climate driver. All the historical and recent evidence is stacked against it. While my opponent gives links to a consensus and impacts of possible warming, I have focused on the argument at hand. Explaining why Co2 does not drive climate. While my opponent has made little to no argument, I have shown why the conclusions of the scientists in the consensus he listed were wrong.

    <t>First my opponent says that I should have asked questions about the structure earlier in the debate but ignores the fact that, in the comment section, I did ask about the order of the debate and explain what I thought it meant. Therefore, I did alert my opponent to my confusion and my opponent either chose to ignore it or did not see it but either way I made my confusion known. Therefore, my opponent did break their own rules.  My opponent then says, 'if you are so sure you are correct and there are so many climate change deniers, why don't you publish your r2-3 arguments in a peer reviewed journal?' My response to this is that: 1. There are not many climate change skeptics. This is because people choose not to be skeptical because believing in man made global warming is how you get grants. 2. I don't publish my findings in a peer reviewed journal because they would not get published. This is because the people who choose what to publish in the journals most likely believe in man made global warming and are therefore biased against me. Another reason a journal would not publish a skeptical article about man made global warming is that if they did, then they would be accused of being funded by fossil fuel companies and would be ridiculed. Other scientists have already tried to publish their findings and it is always rejected so why should I try? What people don't realize is that by attacking anyone who has a skeptical view of man made climate change you are preventing research into that area and therefore creating a huge bias in the experiments done and articles published.  In conclusion, my opponent has not rebutted even one of my claims, instead they focus on the accusations of rule breaking. Due to this absence of rebuttals, my arguments stand and therefore, based on this debate, I have proven how climate change is not much of a threat, and that global warming is not caused by man. While my opponent may of used abstracts from peer reviewed articles (as they love pointing out) I have won the debate. I have given 11 points to why climate change is not due to Co2 and given countless examples of natural disaster frequency staying constant. All of the arguments I have made in this debate go uncontested and therefore prove that climate change is not man made and that the threat is exaggerated. Due to this, all voters are mandated to vote Con under more convincing arguments and conduct.  Thank you for reading this debate.</t>

    <t>My opponent throws around a bunch of irrelevant facts to try to disprove highly credible and peer reviewed articles. At this point, responding to my opponent's arguments directly would only give the impression that they were worth responding to. I added a few more peer reviewed articles to back up my points. I use peer reviewed to prove that anthropic climate change is real and a threat. When two sides of the debate conflict on facts, the winner goes to the side who uses the more credible sources. My opponent uses blogs and other sources with notorious reputations. Then, my opponent proceeds to engage in conjecture that these red herrings somehow impact the resolution. At the very least voters, give me the more credible sources points. The below quote, although lengthy explains that man-made climate change isn't something far in the future, its an event that has occurred already and is continuing to occur and claim human lives. I have overwhelmingly met my burden of proof. Thanks for the debate. ''Unusually high temperatures, as well as socioeconomic vulnerability, along with social attenuation of hazards, in a general context where the anthropogenic contribution to climate change is becoming more plausible, led to an excess of 14,947 deaths in France, between August 4 and 18, 2003. The greatest increase in mortality was due to causes directly attributable to heat: dehydration, hyperthermia, heat stroke. In addition to age and gender, combinatorial factors included preexisting disease, medication, urban residence, isolation, poverty, and, probably, air pollution. Although diversely impacted or reported, many parts of Europe suffered human and other losses, such as farming and forestry through drought and fires. Summer 2003 was the hottest in Europe since 1500, very likely due in part to anthropogenic climate change.''</t>

    <t>My opponent breaks their own rules by not rebutting my argument. Therefore it is an automatic win for the Con as my opponent can decide when they want to break the rules or not, leaving me at an unfair disadvantage. Instead of following their own rules and rebutting my claims, my opponent decides to strengthen their argument. This creates an automatic win condition for the Con.  Rebuttals: Strong hurricane numbers have stayed almost constant since 1880: Tornado numbers have stayed constant since 1950 in the U.S. Drought frequency seems to have stayed constant for almost 50 years. Sea levels are not rising due to heat because the Argo Buoy System data shows that the ocean has not warmed since we started measuring (2003) This shows that the sea only seems to be rising because of tectonic plate movement and the supposed rise is only due to a natural cycle. Antarctic ice extent has reached record levels in 2012, 2013 and 2014. This has been blamed on increased precipitation causing more snowfall but if this is true then how come the same thing isn't happening in the Arctic? If this were true, then Arctic ice would be growing too.  It is true that heat wave frequency has increased but other natural disaster frequencies have stayed constant proving that the climate change threat is either nonexistent or being exaggerated.  In conclusion, while I agree that rapid climate change poses a threat, I believe that this threat is being exaggerated and that humanity does not have to worry about extreme heat or any other natural disaster for much longer because once the world enters a natural cooling period all of this will be forgotten.</t>

    <t>Hello, loyal comrades.  As a devout socialist (coughs and splutters- apparently the word communist is illegal nowadays) I can confirm that the idea of an environment is a plot to destroy the capitalist infidels of the west, the idea is to push their focus so far into ideas of global warming and the environment that they will not see the coming revolution. Before they know it, the means of production will have been seized and the bourgeoise crippled.  The master plan for the environmental decoy was first formed by loyal soviet Leonid Kzyladskystok, who's idea was taken by Comrade Stalin, and it's creator purged. The mighty Stalin then locked the idea away in a secret KGB chamber for later use. It was discovered years later, after the 'fall' of the mighty Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, by loyal communist Hai Chi Zendog, who took the proposition to Xingping of China, who put the idea into action.  In more depth, the plot is to pull the focus of weak, populist politicians such as Barack Obama to the issues of global warming, and how to prevent it, while secretly building up a force to crush the bourgeoise and initiate the revolution. Machines of war, such as tanks and planes, will be cut down due to their 'environmental cost' by the U.S. and other western infidels, while the loyal socialists in the east grow in strength for the revolution.  Movements such as that of the infidel Donald J Trump have threatened to destroy the plot, so the spy Bernie Sanders was placed to win the presidency and continue to disillusion Americans and other westerners with the Global warming lie, in order to weaken the Bourgeoise for the upcoming revolution.  So there you have it, capitalist pigs, from an insider. The idea of an environment is actually a socialist plot to initiate the revolution and destroy capitalism.  Your loyal Comrade, Harry</t>

    <t>I would say the idea of the environment started with Charles Darwin in 1859. 'The theory of evolution by natural selection, first formulated in Darwin's book 'On the Origin of Species' in 1859, is the process by which organisms change over time as a result of changes in heritable physical or behavioral traits. Changes that allow an organism to better adapt to its environment will help it survive and have more offspring. ' [1]'In 1848, Marx and fellow German thinker Friedrich Engels published “The Communist Manifesto,” which introduced their concept of socialism as a natural result of the conflicts inherent in the capitalist system.' [2]As you can see the idea of the environment came out after the idea of Karl Marx in 1848. So this idea isn't completely impossible. If the idea of the environment came before Marx was born I could show this as impossible. Instead, I will show how unlikely this idea that the environment is a socialist plot. Now Karl Marx and Darwin had contact, again I can't show impossible, but can show improbable. 'Letter from Charles Darwin to Karl MarxOctober, 1873' [3]As you can see Marx and Darwin did not have contact until 1873 which was well after the idea of the environment was developed. Of course it is possible that Marx influenced Darwin to create the theory of evolution as a socialist plot to destroy capitalism, yet I find this absurdly improbable. </t>

    <t>OutlineI. IntroII. CorrelationIII. Confounding factorsIV. Reverse causalityV. Likely a threatVI. Man made VII. ConclusionVIII. SourcesI. Intro Brief intro, I created this debate before, and expected an easy win. I was completely blind sided by my opponent's arguments and it was too late in the debate to recover. Basically, I ended up with a tangled mess and decided the best move was to give up and make a fresh start. Feel free to make the same arguments if you debated me before. Burden of proof, I need to prove three objectives to win. Burden of proof should be 99% Pro and 1% con on all three objectivesII. CorrelationTo prove causation I first need to prove correlation, which is easy enough. Insert picture here. [0] It is well known that carbon is increasing in parts per million. Now at 404.48 ppm III. Confounding factorsThe second problem is confounding factors. Mostly some solar event that affects the entire solar system. Since only a few planets and moons are warming it is safe to assume there are no confounding factors with enough impact to be relevant. [2][3]To restate, surely there are negligible confounding factors that are irrelevant.IV. Reverse causalityNow the only part that is left for the first part of the burden of proof is causality. Co2 and global temperature have a two way causality relationship. Meaning as the oceans heat, Co2 is released which in turns heats up the ocean more. For example, when exiting an ice age first the Earth tilts raising temperature. [4]The temperature increase causes the oceans to release Co2 which is a green house gas. The green house gas in turn increase the ocean's temperatures. Therefore, it is safe to say that Co2 causes global climate change. Readers should now be at least 99% sure that Co2 causes global climate change and warming.V. Likely a threatNow, to prove that the climate change we are experiencing regardless of the cause is a threat, we need a correlation when temperatures suddenly changed. Using the Antarctica ice, we can look at Co2 and temperatures back millions of years. Whenever we see a sudden spike in temperature mass extinctions occur.Mass extinction are a threat to the human race. In fact mass extinctions are occurring right now. Therefore, I have proven then sudden temperature changes, including the one we are experiencing at this moment are correlated with mass extinctions which we are experiencing now. There is also many political problems and threats that come with global climate change. [5] Bill Nye thinks IS (Islamic State) is linked with climate change. Farmers are abandoing their lands due to water shortfalls and becoming terrorists. Therefore, the Paris attacks were caused in part by global climate change.[6] I have fufilled my burden of proof that there is a 99% chance that climate change is a threat.VI. Man madeNow the most difficult part, to prove the changes are man-made. Many climate change deniers will agree with the first two parts and strongly disagree with the third. I need to prove there is at least a 99% chance that man made climate change is real. First, man made Co2 is only a small portion of the Co2 generated. The problem is two fold, first humans are destroying Co2 sinks including forests. Via human made deforestation we are removing much of our Co2 buffer. Second, we are producing Co2 via burning of fossil fuels. Unlike naturally occurring Co2 this is not cycled. Another way of explaining is that non-human Co2 is balanced out by naturally occurring events. Despite being small, made-made Co2 is upsetting the balance of nature. Yet, the question remains, how do we know its not natural? Remember the oceans releasing Co2. Well if this was a natural event the increase in Co2 would come from the oceans. To disprove this is not a natural event we can simply look at the Co2 and acidity of the oceans. The oceans are gaining in Co2 not losing. Meaning this is not a natural event that raises temperature and the Co2 is released from the oceans. Instead, the oceans are absorbing more Co2 then losing. [7] I have met my burden of proof that there is at least a 99% chance that global climate change is man made. VII. ConclusionJust in case you needed more evidence here is some easily observable evidence including glaciers. [8] I have fulfilled my burden of proof, 99% that climate change is real and a threat. Man made global climate change is real and is a threat. Thanks for the debate. </t>

[2] Just because the majority of scientists think man made climate change is real and a threat, does not mean the scientists are correct. At one time we thought the Earth was flat and the sun revolved around the Earth. ' 'Does the Earth go around the Sun, or does the Sun go around the Earth?'If you answered the latter, you're among a quarter of Americans who also got it wrong, according to a new report by the National Science Foundation. ' [3]There is a chance that the entire global warming/climate change is a scam. That the deniers are whistle blowers. If we start jailing whistle blowers we could be in a lot of trouble. [4] Remember that 97% of climate change scientists agree. That means 3% don't, those 3% could be legitimate whistle blowers. Some of the scientist claim there is bullying going on to reach the consensuses. [5] There is talk of data manipulation. [6] Honestly, I will not stoop by backing up the deniers. I think the chances of the deniers being wrong is at least 99%. Nevertheless, there is that 1% chance. More importantly, it sets a precedence as seen in r1.Finally, and perhaps my strongest argument. Assume for a second that the deniers are wrong. Not much of an assumption. Jailing the deniers could backfire. Causing them to become martyrs per say. Holding back political change and giving the deniers a louder voice.Thanks for debating and being respectful. I am not a climate change denier, I just feel both sides of the debate need to be represented. </t>

    <t>There is an overwhelming scientific consensus climate change presents a serious risk to the future of the Earth and to mankind. Many of the threats we face due to climate change are insidious and while with others the connection may not be noticed by the deniers. But they are real and serious. Among these are the spread of potentially lethal diseases such as that caused by the Zika virus. Other diseases formerly confined to the tropics will spread across North America and Europe.  There is also overwhelming scientific consensus climate change is being caused by human activity.  There are a limited number of circumstances under which free speech can be restricted. One of them is child pornography. The reason that can be banned with violating the 1st Amendment is the harm caused to children in the production of child porn is of such magnitude the normal means of combating bad speech-- more speech is not adequate or sufficient.  The ignorance peddled by climate change deniers many of whom like child pornographers do so for greed. Those threatened most by the adverse effects of climate change are children. These will include teenagers sent to fight the increasing number of wars and conflicts which will likely occur.  Yes the risk is too high to allow this ignorance to continue to be peddled.  Should we jail people who write and utter falsehoods about climate change? If need be yes.</t>

<h>My opponent accepts that his first argument is a correlation so there is no need to strengthen my argument there.  My opponents second argument states, '''When the Earth comes out of an ice age, the warming is not initiated by CO2 but by changes in the Earth's orbit. The warming causes the oceans to release CO2. The CO2 amplifies the warming and mixes through the atmosphere, spreading warming throughout the planet. So CO2 causes warming AND rising temperature causes CO2 rise. Overall, about 90% of the global warming occurs after the CO2 increase.'''  To disprove this I will do it line by line.  Line 1: When the Earth comes out of an ice age, the warming is not initiated by CO2 but by changes in the Earth's orbit This line is true but only in some cases. For example, the mini ice age, which we exited 1000 years ago, was not initiated by changes in the earths orbit.  Line 2: This line is just wrong. The oceans do store Co2 but what is released when they warm is mostly water vapor, not Co2. This water vapor then causes more clouds which then cools the Earth. This is common knowledge among scientists because this is exactly how cosmic rays cause cooling.  Line 3: Yes, rising temperature causes more Co2 to be released but by simply looking at ice core data we can see that this does not cause an infinite rise in temperature. The temperature then drops and rises again independent of the Co2 that was released from the previous rise. For an example, look at this graph: http://www.geocraft.com...  My opponents next argument is just plain wrong. My opponent states, ''Even if we ignore long term trends and just look at the record-breakers, 2015, 2014, 2010, and 2005 were hotter than 1998.  The myth of no warming since 1998 was based on the satellite record estimates of the temperature of the atmosphere. However, as discussed in the video below by Peter Sinclair, even that argument is no longer accurate. The satellites show warming since 1998 too.' '  To disprove this all you need to do is read the caption at the top of the graph below where it lists its source. http://4.bp.blogspot.com... As you can see, the graph was not based on temperature estimates but the 'global mean temperature change...' I don't know where you got the idea that 2015, 2014, 2010, and 2005 were hotter than 1998 but from your sources it seems that this data is only true once you remove the El Nino. My question to you is why hasn't the Earth warmed since the El Nino. In the 20 years since the temperature maximum temperature doesn't increase at all. In addition to this, the El Nino just proves the fact that there are other influences in climate that influence temperature more then Co2 or enough to distort data.  For my opponents next argument he states that my source is not credible. This is just not true. Just because the maker of the website is paid to research evidence against man made global warming does not immediately make all of his evidence untrue.

Nextl, to strengthen my point of the debate, I will argue that Earth is not the only planet warming. The entire solar system seems to be going through a sort of 'climate-change phase.' Within the last 20 years scientists at NASA and around the world have realized that the planets we are looking at now are different than those in 1900s. This indicates that the entire solar system is in some sort of solar-system wide climate change.  For example, the ice caps on Mars are shrinking (indicating warming) and the atmosphere is gaining clouds and ozone, Pluto is experiencing a growth of its mysterious dark spots and is experiencing a 300% increase in atmospheric pressure (indicating warming), Saturn is giving off large amount of x rays and there are new appearances of 'hot spots' in its atmosphere (indicating warming), there have been polar shifts on Uranus and voyager 2 picked up large storm spots In its atmosphere that were not there 50 years ago (indicating warming), Mercury is growing a magnetic field, Jupiter's 'white ovals' are disappearing and melding together in its atmosphere (this is theorized to have been caused by an 18 degree Celsius warming and this is supported by the new large storm spots appearing on Jupiter for the first time), Venus has had a 2500% increase in green glow which symbolizes oxygen in the atmosphere, and Neptune is experiencing changes in light intensity.  As you can see from the long paragraph I have provided above, the entire Solar System seems to be warming or experiencing some sort of weird climate change patterns.

    <t>First, I would like to thank my opponent for debating this topic with me in a respectful manner. Courage is needed to go against the majority. Second, I would like to note my opponent's response is very dense. To disprove my opponent's arguments I need to take my opponent's statements a few sentences at a time. 'Your first argument, 'Carbon dioxide is at 404.48 parts per million and the temperature has increased 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880.' That is not a scientific argument. It is a correlation. There is no REAL evidence to suggest that Co2 impact temperature.' rammer5678Yes, you are correct as presented it is a correlation. I will now show that there is causation. ''When the Earth comes out of an ice age, the warming is not initiated by CO2 but by changes in the Earth's orbit. The warming causes the oceans to release CO2. The CO2 amplifies the warming and mixes through the atmosphere, spreading warming throughout the planet. So CO2 causes warming AND rising temperature causes CO2 rise. Overall, about 90% of the global warming occurs after the CO2 increase.'' [2]There should be no doubt that CO2 causes global warming. 'Especially when 25% of all Co2 produced by man has been released in the last 20 years and in that time there has been NO NET WARMING!!!' rammer5678All caps always helps prove science. Temperatures have risen. In 2005, 2010, 2014, and 2015 were hotter than 1998. 'Even if we ignore long term trends and just look at the record-breakers, 2015, 2014, 2010, and 2005 were hotter than 1998.The myth of no warming since 1998 was based on the satellite record estimates of the temperature of the atmosphere. However, as discussed in the video below by Peter Sinclair, even that argument is no longer accurate. The satellites show warming since 1998 too.' [3]Temperatures have risen in the last twenty years. 'You also make it sound like 1.4 degrees is what was predicted by the models showing Co2 causing temperature. I wasn't.' rammer5678You are correct that not all the models were correct. The overall premise is correct that the planet is getting warmer due to CO2. As for your link from wattsupwiththat.com, this is a known climate change denial site. The site is run by Willard Anthony Watts. He is a paid AGW denier, Anthropogenic Global Warming denier. 'Willard Anthony Watts (Anthony Watts) is a blogger, weathercaster and non-scientist, paid AGW denier who runs the website wattsupwiththat.com. He does not have a university qualification and has no climate credentials other than being a radio weather announcer. His website is parodied and debunked at the website wottsupwiththat.com Watts is on the payroll of the Heartland Institute, which itself is funded by polluting industries.[1]' [4]Your source is not credible. Voters please give me the more credible source points if nothing else.'You make a reference to cigarette companies. Please remember that we are talking about Man Made Global Warming, not cigarettes. Keep your own habits to yourself.' rammer5678Yes, this is true. Nevertheless this should impact the resolution since it shows historical evidence of how malice and greed can hold science at bay. Cigarette companies show the depths that people will sink to. 'Al Gores, 'The Inconvenient Truth' predicted that all the arctic ice caps would be melted by 2013. In case you haven't noticed, the ice caps are still there. He also predicted the polar bears would all have died out by now. That hasn't happened.' Rammer5678Not every prediction in the Inconvenient Truth came true. Nevertheless polar bears are struggling and many ice caps are melting. [5]As for the polar bears this is due to hunting restrictions and bans. ' The introduction of the International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears in 1973, which restricted or even banned hunting in some circumstances, consequently resulted in an increase in polar bear numbers.' [6]As you can see, I've destroyed all your arguments while proving causation of CO2 to increase temperature. A few notes, the polar bears are still in danger in the long term. [7] The ice caps melting has provided less hunting ground for them.You also make some inflammatory remarks like Al Gore's documentary was riddled with lies. Many of the predictions have come true. Also, there is a large difference between a falsehood and a lie. The models could not take in every single factor. As time prorgresses we get more and more accurate models.

Manmade global climate change is the general increase in temperature at rapid rates that is mainly caused by CO2 from industry increases. Carbon dioxide is at 404.48 parts per million and the temperature has increased 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880. [0]Although 1.4 degrees doesn't sound much, it ends up being a lot. This is because not all areas of the world heat at the same rate and such a rapid change is hard to adapt to. There is no signs of relief from climate change. My opponent will attempt to deny climate change, but please remember how long the cigarette companies held out despite the science being heavily against them. Now we know as sure as the sun rises that cigarettes cause cancer. I can honestly state that as sure as the sun rises, global climate change is upon us and is a threat. Al Gore's inconvenient truth is still a master piece, and I will not accept defeat until my opponent can defeat the documentary. [1]Not watching Al Gore's documentary is no excuse.

    <t>My opponent does not counter-argue even one of the points I made in my previous arguments/in the comment section. Instead he accuses of of making the argument grow in size to confuse people. Not only is this not true, but it points out how little my opponent understands my argument and this subject. If he had simply read the counter arguments I provided, you can see clearly that I do not try to distract from the topic at hand.  Seeing as my opponent made no further arguments and did not make any comments about how I disproved all of his (relating to man causing the warming) claims, I am only left with the option to strengthen my own argument.  Fact 1: Co2 is a weak greenhouse gas. According to atomic absorption spectroscopy, a method in science used to measure the amount of the electromagnetic spectrum a molecule can store/release, Co2 can only store 7% of the heat that passes through it in the 15 micrometer range. This is minuscule, especially when compared to water vapor which can store 850% more heat then Co2 can.  Fact 2: There is not much Co2 in the atmosphere compared to the rest of the earths history and history tells us there is little to no correlation of temperature to Co2 over long periods of time. It is as simple as looking at this graph: Fact 3: Almost every single planet in the solar system is exhibiting some sort of characteristic attributed to warming. If every planet is warming simultaneously, then why is Earth warming not natural. (For more info check the comment section where there was a mini debate on the subject or my previous debate where I explained the attributes each planet it expressing)  Fact 3: There has been no significant warming in the last 20 years. We have already discussed this topic and my opponent brought up a good argument against it but I disproved it in my last argument (and the comment section). (Keep in mind that in the last 20 years 25% of all Co2 released by man has been released during that period)  Fact 4: The Earth has been warming for the last 20,000 years and the recent uptick started in the 1700's, before the industrial revolution. Fact 5: Sun spots and ocean currents correlated stronger with temperature then Co2 for the majority of the 1900s. Yes, sun spot numbers decreased towards the end of the 1900s but that is also right before temperatures flat lined. Sun Spots Graph: (According to Joe Bastardi the correlation) is .57 1900-2004). Ocean Current Graph: (According to Joe Bastardi the correlation here is .85 1900s-2007) Co2 Graph: (According to Joe Bastardi the correlation (not on this exact graph) is .47 1895-2007). Fact 6: Cosmic rays prove that greenhouse gasses do not have a big impact on the atmosphere. Cosmic rays effect temperature by increasing evaporation, and, in turn, causing more cloud cover which reflects the suns heat off the earth. This disproves man-made climate change because the water vapor doesn't cause the earth to warm more than the clouds it forms causes the Earth to cool. This just proves the fact that other variables in the climate have way more of an effect on the overall temperature then most greenhouse gasses and the idea that Co2, which is weaker then water vapor, solely dictates climate is just plain wrong.  Fact 7: Almost every single climate model prediction warming from Co2 was wrong (see earlier argument for graphs)  Fact 8: There is no way to scientifically test, through a controlled experiment, whether Co2 causes enough warming to drive the atmosphere. You can test that the Co2 is a greenhouse gas, but you can't test that it is a strong enough greenhouse gas to impact global climate. This just proves that the idea that Co2 causes warming is not based in science. It is based off of faith in computer models or flawed logic.  In conclusion, I have now proven, beyond any doubt, that Co2 cannot be the main climate driver. I have given historical evidence, explained the flaws in the logic presented through cosmic ray induced cooling, shown how Co2 driving climate can't be scientifically tested, explained how we are not the only planet experiencing warming and described how much stronger other climate drivers are then Co2 by presenting correlation strengths of each driver. My opponent has effectively given up the argument and accused me of distracting the readers from the problem at hand. As you can see, just by reading the 8 facts listed above, I have not distracted, I have not manipulated. I have provided clear, easy to understand, proof to why my opponent is wrong. I have disproven all of his arguments, whether in the comment section or in my arguments presented above and given countless examples of evidence to why my side of the argument is correct. Thank you for reading this long debate and I hope you are certain of the right choice when you vote.  To my opponent: I will be very surprised if you are reading this because it seems you have been ignoring my arguments from the beginning. You are so biased towards your own opinion that I am surprised you even decided to read any of my arguments instead of saying, 'oh, he didn't separate the lines into enough paragraphs!' and ignoring them. I have looked at your past debates and concluded that, while you have done a good job at defeating some people, Retroz and maybe Epidexipteryx have both gotten the better of you. Even in your past debates (including the ones you have won) you have not been able to prove anything you claim. You attack sources, you focus on grammar, but you don't focus on your argument. This is why you attacked the whatsupwiththat website without providing any actual evidence showing the data I presented from it was wrong. In fact, you even admitted it was right! This just proves that attacking sources doesn't get you anywhere with your argument. Just a side tip, if you are going to attack anyone else's sources in future arguments, skeptical science isn't a trustworthy website either. It is run by John Cook who is known for manipulating and masking real information as he did with the 97% consensus. Go to 3:02 in this video or watch the whole thing. Here is an article saying the same thing. Keep in mind that this renders almost every single one of your arguments useless so if this debate actually focused on how credible sources are, I would instantly win.  I thank you for participating in this debate, it was very fun, and I hope that we can both part from this as friends (or people that know each other online and happened to do a debate together whichever you prefer)</t>

    <t>I am here to debate the MAN MADE side of climate change. I do not disagree that the world is warming, I only believe the current warming trends are exaggerated and people are freaking out over a natural process.  Man Made Climate Change, The FACTS:  1.There is NO way to test whether Co2 is the most contributing factor to the world's climate: Many people I have met say, 'Manmade global warming is real and Co2 is the cause!' but how do you actually test that. Yes, Co2 is a greenhouse gas and traps warmth, I am not denying that. What we haven't tested is whether this warmth has a great enough impact to trump all other factors that influence climate. For example, ocean currents, cosmic rays, sun irradiance, the sun spot cycle, Earth's magnetic field, Earth's orbit, Earth's tilt, Volcanos, etc' all effect the climate. Why is Co2 more important than all of these factors? Let's find out! Oh, wait, you can't. This is where you reach a problem. How do you find out? You can't, scientifically, create a real, controlled experiment to test whether Co2 has a bigger impact than any of these other factors. This means that the entire idea that Co2 causes climate change is based on computer models and it can't actually be tested. This shows that the idea that Co2 causes warming is less science then it is religion because you are putting your faith in a computer model rather than observing and recording data. Keep in mind that simple correlations do not qualify as scientific data. Proof that greenhouse gasses don't have a large impact on climate can be found at the bottom of this page at 'Final Proof.' 2.The computer models don't work The computer models mentioned previously have been shown not to work time and time again. Even the most advanced ones fail and don't predict the correct temperature. This is because people think that Co2 has more of an impact then it really does so when they program it into the models it messes with the correct predictions. This is why the vast majority of climate models predict temperature is way higher than it is.  3.Co2 is a weak greenhouse gas According to atomic absorption spectroscopy, a method used to measure the amount of the electromagnetic spectrum a molecule can absorb, Co2 can only store a miniscule 7% of the amount of heat that passes through it in the 15 micrometer range. Compare this to water vapor, which, in statistics, can store 850% more heat than Co2 can. In addition to this, there is 2100000% more water vapor in the air then Co2. This shows that Co2 is actually a relatively weak greenhouse gas and for it to make an impact you would need much more of it then there is now.  4.There is not as much Co2 as you might think I have constantly heard, over and over again, that there is too much Co2 in the atmosphere. The problem with this statement is that it is just plain wrong. Comparing the amount of Co2 we have in the atmosphere now (400 parts per million, ppm for short) and we have had in the last 650 million years shows that now we are in a Co2 starved era. For example, look at this graph: Keep in mind that this graph only goes back 650 million years. Co2 has been over 10000ppm in the past and temperature had been relatively low at that time.  5.The earth has been warming for 20,000 years now: Not only is the idea that Co2 is causing the recent warming preposterous, but it just doesn't make any sense. This is because the world has been warming naturally for the last 20,000 years and the recent uptick in warming started in the 1700s. Both of these time periods were before any humans were releasing any significant amount of Co2. This only proves that the current warm phase is natural. More evidence would be that there hasn't been any significant warming in the last 20 years. Yes, this is a small amount of time, but if temperature truly relied on Co2 as its main cause then surely the temperature should have gone up. Especially considering that 25% of all Co2 released by man ever has been released into the atmosphere in the last few decades.  The political side of things: This is a big topic so I won't be able to cover everything but I will do the most important topics under this subject. The 97% number: This number is thrown around way too often and most of the time misused. This number came from a study that stated as its conclusion, '97% of climate scientists agree that climate change is real' but everyone seems to think it said man-made climate change was real. Another problem with this number is that it came from a survey that completely manipulated almost every scientific paper that was submitted. All the papers in the survey were ultimately sent to one man (John Cook) who categorized based on what he thought they meant. Not only is this a biased way of filtering through papers but what the papers said depended on his opinion, not on their actual statements. This anti-science method of categorizing papers eventually led thousands of scientific papers to be misrepresented in the survey. Watch this video to hear what I said but in a more in-depth way: The 2 degree rise: This claim is also completely bogus. The idea that a 2 degree rise in average temperature is going to devastate the world is just plain wrong. The world was 2 degrees warmer during the medieval warming period 1000 years. Then, before the medieval warming period was the Roman warming period which was warmer then the medieval. Then, even before the Roman, there was the Minoan warming period which was 4 degrees Celsius warmer then today.  The hockey stick: The graph was fabricated and is completely fake and manipulated. I'm too lazy to explain it all so click on the presentation someone else made below to find out why I'm right: The final proof: And now, I present to you, the final proof of why man-made climate change isn't real: It is known that cosmic rays effect temperature by increasing evaporation, and, in turn, causing more cloud cover which reflects the suns heat off the earth. This disproves man-made climate change because the water vapor, which is 850% more potent then Co2, doesn't cause the earth to warm more than the clouds it forms causes the Earth to cool. This just proves the fact that other factors in the climate have way more of an effect on the overall temperature then most greenhouse gasses and the idea that Co2, which is weaker then water vapor, solely dictates climate is just plain wrong.</t>

    <t>If you wanted a serious debate then you would not have ignored my entire argument. So I guess since you are not paying attention to my arguments I will just have to disprove yours instead of adding to my own.  You firstly say that, 'The temperature has increased .87 Celsius.' This is true, but you forgot to mention that the warming period that caused this rise started in the 1700's before the industrial revolution. In addition to this, the world has been naturally warming for the last 20,000 years. You ignored large amounts of scientific data in your argument and made a claim that I agree with. The world IS WARMING!!! It just is not caused by man. According to your second argument, Co2 is at 400 ppm. This is true, but there has been no substantial warming for the last 20 years which is proof of how temperature and Co2 act independently. In addition to this, 25% of all Co2 released by man has been released during the last 20 year period. This in itself disproves your claim. In addition to this, Co2 has been at much higher levels in the past. To restate what I said above, 'Comparing the amount of Co2 we have in the atmosphere now (400 parts per million, ppm for short) and we have had in the last 650 million years shows that now we are in a Co2 starved era. For example, look at this graph. Keep in mind that this graph only goes back 650 million years. Co2 has been over 10000 ppm in the past and temperature had been relatively low at that time.'  There may be a clear and strong positive correlation between Co2 and temperature but this correlation has been weak compared to that of sun spots. For the majority of the 1900's sun spots correlated MORE STRONGLY to temperature then Co2 did. This means that sun spots had a bigger impact then Co2 on the temperature. Yes, I know that sun spot numbers dropped around the early 2000s but that is irrelevant because for the majority of the 1900's, when tons and tons of Co2 were released, the temperature was affected more by sun spots then it was by Co2. Another thing to point out, when sun spot numbers started to drop is when the flat line in temperature began. In actual statistics, according to Joe Bastardi, Co2 has a correlation strength to temperature of just .43 (1895-2007). Other sources say that the correlation strength is just .07 or .02 (1998-2007). Compare this correlation strength to the correlation strength of sunspots and the ocean, .57 (1900-2004) and .85 (1900-2007). In conclusion, not only have you ignored the majority of my first argument, you state claims that I am not even trying to disprove. You obviously don't understand what I am trying to debate or don't know how to debate my claims. In addition to this, you gave almost no evidence to support your claims, only sources of where you got the information. If you want to have a real debate, maybe reading my arguments would help.

    <t>Please stick to only the man-made part of this argument. I am not denying the world is heating or any possible effects of that. I am saying that man does not cause it.  Also, quoting a consensus is NOT science. I want to hear your argument, not some random scientists. Science is based off of hard facts and evidence to support claims, not a consensus of random scientists whether they studied climate or not.  Here are my reasons: 1.There is NO way to test whether Co2 is the most contributing factor to the world's climate: Many people I have met say, 'Man made global warming is real and Co2 is the cause!' but how do you actually test that. Yes, Co2 is a greenhouse gas and traps warmth, I am not denying that. What we haven't tested is whether this warmth has a great enough impact to trump all other factors that influence climate. For example, ocean currents, cosmic rays, sun irradiance, the sun spot cycle, Earth's magnetic field, Earth's orbit, Earth's tilt, Volcanos, etc' all effect the climate. Why is Co2 more important than all of these factors? Let's find out! Oh, wait, you can't. This is where you reach a problem. How do you find out? You can't, scientifically, create a real, controlled experiment to test whether Co2 has a bigger impact than any of these other factors.

    <t>*Sorry for assuming your gender but I didn't realize that I wrote 'he' instead of 'they' until the very end! :)  Im going to start my argument by countering my opponents observations. His first observation states that he will debate that humans are contributing to the already natural processes but my question is contributing how much. There is not doubt in my mind that Co2 causes warming. The question is whether this warming is significant or not. To clarify, I believe the warming Co2 creates is insignificant and barely has an effect on climate.  His second observation states that quoting a scientific consensus is science. He is correct in saying that a consensus is more scientific then a home experiment but a scientific paper or research article is better then both. Especially when there is so much controversy about the validity of the consensus.  My opponent then addresses my first argument and states, 'I will provide empirical evidence that in fact it has a huge impact if not the biggest' yet he provides no evidence after this claim.  I run into the same problem when he addresses my second claim. He says, ' there is other evidence that proves CO2 does have an impact' while providing NO scientific evidence. (keep in mind that correlations do NOT show causation so giving a graph of temperature and Co2 rising is not sufficient evidence) He also says that computer models are not always going to be 100% correct which is true but you would expect the predictions made by said models to be closer to the observations. The fact that only a small majority of the models show similar trends to our observations indicate that something is wrong with the models.  In my opponents addressing of my third statement, he makes a valid case, pointing out the fact that Co2 increases atmospheric humidity but disregards the fact that water vapor then condenses into clouds which then reflect heat and light energy away from the earth, therefore cooling it down. I mentioned this at the end of my argument under the label, 'The Final proof' where I explained how cosmic rays cause cooling and why this disproves the greenhouse effect.  My opponent then says, 'my opponent is stating we would need more CO2 to see an impact.' Although I did not state this before, I do agree with this statement. My opponent says this is a unscientific claim but ignores that planets, such as Venus, with extraordinary high (96%) levels of Co2 in their atmosphere are warmer because of it. Nasa says that venus would not be as hot as it is without Co2 or methane.  My opponent also says there is an undoubted correlation between Co2 and warming but this statement depends on what time period you are looking at. For example, according to Joe Bastardi, Co2 has a correlation strength to temperature of just .43 (1895-2007). Other sources say that the correlation strength is just .07 or .02 (1998-2007). according to Joe Bastardi, Co2 has a correlation strength to temperature of just .43 (1895-2007). Compare this correlation strength to the correlation strength of sunspots and the ocean, .57 (1900-2004) and .85 (1900-2007). As you can see, the correlation strength of Co2 compared to other correlations is anything but strong. Another thing to point out is that over longer periods of time, Co2 has almost no correlation to temperature. I meant to put this graph in my argument above but I posted the wrong link so here is the evidence supporting my claim. Then my opponent states the Co2 has not been higher then today within the last 800,000 years. This is true, but there is a problem this points out. The temperature HAS been higher then today. This just proves that temperature acts independent of Co2. Co2 has not been higher then today while temperature has risen up to 4 degrees Celsius hotter then today. Then, in my opponents fifth point, he states, 'Today though, we are seeing this clearly attributed to CO2 in the air from humans as the temperature goes beyond what would be seen as natural.' This is just an untrue statement. The majority of the worlds lifespan has been spent with no ice on the poles and the dinosaurs lived in an environment that was much hotter then today. Also, as I mentioned earlier, in the past 1000 years, during the medieval warming period, temperature was 2 degrees Celsius warmer then today and that was only in the last 1000 years!  Thanks for acknowledging that the political arguments are irrelevant, I have argued with many people about this topic before and the political arguments always come up so I wanted to include some just to ward people off if that is what they were planning to debate.  In my opponents case he just states everything that I have already disproven.  He says greenhouse gasses cause warming but Co2 is a very weak greenhouse gas and there is not much of it in the atmosphere.  He says humans are netting 15 gigatons of Co2 into the atmosphere which is true but he doesn't explain why, if there is so much Co2 in the air, there has been no significant warming in the last 2 decades. Especially when 25% of all human caused Co2 emissions occurred during that time period. Another problem is that the chart he provided of the carbon cycle is wrong. I have seen charts like it before and the problem with them is that they don't explain rises in Co2, sometimes over periods of millions of years, in the past. According to that chart, Co2 would be on a constant decline. We know this is not true because looking at a graph he provided us Co2 is constantly in balance with the environment. It is not on an overall decrease.  To my opponents final message, I don't know why the atmosphere is warming if it is not caused by Co2. I am not even going to try and come up with other reasons because the climate is constantly changing and to complex for me to completely understand. I have seen the video you sent me, along with all the other videos in that college course. The problem with the video is that it relies on the idea that Co2 causes warming. Without any significant warming affects, how do they know the 'fingerprint' it leaves? This just causes a loop back to the debate about whether it actually causes warming or not.  After reading your responses and acknowledging the claims you have made, I see no real scientific evidence of man-made global warming. Yes, there are correlations and yes, there are consensuses, but none of these are true pieces of evidence. True evidence would be performing a controlled experiment and testing only 1 variable at a time. As I explained in my first argument, this is not possible.  In conclusion, I await your next argument and wish you the best of luck in debating me.</t>

    <t>My opponent kept mentioning that I was making claims without backing them. I was unclear but that's because my case was at the bottom and had gone over that evidence. To eliminate as much confusion as possible I will add all that evidence with those statements that appeared to have none.  My evidence that CO2 has a huge impact is here:  1: My opponent has acknowledged that CO2 is a green house gas. Green house gasses cause global warming.  2: humans are netting 15 gigatons of carbon into the atmosphere that has no place in the carbon cycle. Prior to industry all carbon fit into the cycle. 3: If CO2 causes warming, and humans are omitting extra CO2 that we are having an impact on climate. Thus I hold my claim that humans are impacting climate change.  Of course my opponent clarified that the real debate is how much CO2 has an impact and whether it is miniscule. So they would say some measure that CO2 is a major player in changing the climate. That evidence is in trends in the atmosphere where lower layers are heating up and upper layers are not. This is a sign of CO2 causing the heating.  On top of that, use my opponents point that if venus didn't have as much CO2 they would be significantly cooler. This proves that there is significant correlation between CO2 and climate. Then throw in how much CO2 humans throw into the atmosphere and what trends we are seeing now and conclude for yourself.  This all rest the case that climate change is being effected by men. My opponent is probably going to argue that they need to see cold hard numbers, but this is not grounds to throw out the logic I have provided. Its impossible to measure with certainty exactly how much people are impacting. But the logic is there and evidence does point to CO2 being the main cause.  Also, just in case my opponent isn't sure that CO2 is coming from people, I ask he or she look to this evidence again that shows the carbon cycle was working naturally until industrial CO2 overloaded it. My opponent is always saying that the correlation is not strong. For this just keep in mind the physical signs we are seeing that it is CO2 such as the atmospheric patterns of heating showing that CO2 is the cause of this, not other signs. It doesn't get much more scientific.  My opponent writes 'Then my opponent states the Co2 has not been higher then today within the last 800,000 years. This is true, but there is a problem this points out. The temperature HAS been higher then today. This just proves that temperature acts independent of Co2. Co2 has not been higher then today while temperature has risen up to 4 degrees Celsius hotter then today. 'Of course the graph they is of one place which is a spotlight fallacy. You can't point to one location. Also the largest difference in temperatures is in 7 degrees Fahrenheit over the past 10,000 years.  When my opponent quotes me saying the temperature todays is unnatural, they misunderstood my point.  I wasn't saying that extreme temperatures haven't occurred naturally. I meant that we would expect the dramatic changes to be much further apart. In the years before the recent era major changes in climate were rare and on somewhat of a cycle of hot to cold and back with even spacing of time. now we are seeing changes much more erratically and quickly.  My opponent is arguing that man made climate change has not been proven with fool proof certainty and has turned this into an evidence debate. So far this debate has been a debate of clashing evidence that cancel out each-others claims. There has been a lot of research on each side that can just as reliably disprove the other. At this point it is time to look to logical claims and each side ought to put up some logic to the claim.  I have given a clear thought process as to why men and women have had an impact on the climate. I would like to see logical sequential ideas that lead to the notion that climate change must be all natural.  Thanks for this debate to this point so far. (:</t>

    <t>First I would like to thank my opponent for the opportunity for this debate,  I would like to start by making a few observations: 1) I am arguing that the human race has had a measurable impact on global warming. I acknowledge that natural climate change does happen. I will debate that humans are contributing to recent global warming. 2) My opponent says that quoting a consensus is not science. However, it has to be seen that a scientific study by real scientists is going to be more reliable than some kind of theory or home conducted experiment.  Before we begin I would just like to ask for evidence behind the claims in point 3 just for reference.  I will begin by analyzing my opponents case and then move on to my own.  My opponents 1st point states that there is no hard proof that CO2 from humans is the most important part to causing global warming. Even if it's not the MOST important part, if humans have any impact than we are changing the climate from what is natural. I will provide empirical evidence that in fact it has a huge impact if not the biggest.  2: My opponent argues that the computer models don't work. Even if this is true, there is other evidence that proves CO2 does have an impact. Also, computer models are just a way of prediction and we can't expect them to be 100% correct.  3: My opponent argued that CO2 is a weak greenhouse gas. My opponent argues that water vapor has a stronger green house effect. Even if this is true, adding CO2 to the atmosphere is actually a cause for more humid atmosphere making it worse. So even if you believe my opponent that it is actually the water vapor that is the more disastrous greenhouse gas, this problem stems from CO2 also, which stems from humans. Basically my opponent is stating we would need more CO2 to see an impact which is not a scientific claim and there is an undoubted correlation between CO2 and warming.  4: In response to my opponents claim that their is less CO2 now than ever before, according to Freedman at climate central, 'CO2 levels are far higher now than they have been for anytime during the past 800,000 years.' Also, from NASA. 'atmospheric carbon dioxide does naturally fluctuate, but it's never been has high as it is today' (i would recommend looking at this graph for the link provided!  5: Your statement about the temperature increasing for the past 20,000 years is true, however that was when the last severe cold stage in the climate happened. So naturally the climate is on its way to being warmer.  Today though, we are seeing this clearly attributed to CO2 in the air from humans as the temperature goes beyond what would be seen as natural.  As for the political arguments. That is probably all true, but does not prove that humans don't have to do with global warming.  Now for my case:  1: Humans are altering the climate.  My evidence comes in 3 stages.  1: My opponent has acknowledged that CO2 is a green house gas. Green house gasses cause global warming.  2: humans are netting 15 gigatons of carbon into the atmosphere that has no place in the carbon cycle. Prior to industry all carbon fit into the cycle. 3: If CO2 causes warming, and humans are omitting extra CO2 that we are having an impact on climate. Thus I hold my claim that humans are impacting climate change.  Some may still remain skeptical in believing that there are things that may not be CO2 causing global warming. While other causes like volcanic eruptions, or the tilt of the earth have had causes thousands of year ago. We are seeing trends in the the atmoshphere that point to CO2 being the cause as opposed to thermal energy. Check out the video here.</t>

    <t>My opponents first second and third points state, 'My opponent has acknowledged that CO2 is a green house gas. Green house gasses cause global warming... humans are netting 15 gigatons of carbon into the atmosphere that has no place in the carbon cycle. Prior to industry all carbon fit into the cycle... If CO2 causes warming, and humans are omitting extra CO2 that we are having an impact on climate. Thus I hold my claim that humans are impacting climate change.'  To respond to this, I would like to bring up the argument that there is not that much Co2 in the atmosphere compared to the Earths past. 15 gigatons sounds like a lot but it compared to the Earths past Co2 has been much higher. In addition to this, historical evidence shows that Co2 has no correlation to temperature and most ice core data shows that higher temperature causes Co2 increase, not the other way around.  My opponents next claim is that there are significant 'fingerprints' caused by Co2 induced heating in the atmosphere. This is not a valid point because I am arguing that Co2 doesn't cause enough heat to significantly impact the atmosphere in the way my opponent is describing. This just brings us in a circle back to the argument that is if CO2 causes warming or not.  My opponents next correlation is that since Venus has high Co2 concentrations and it is known that this is why venus is hot it would make sense that we would be seeing the same effects on Earth.  My response to this is that Venus's atmosphere is 96% Co2. This is more then enough Co2 to have a significant impact on its atmosphere. This is drastically different from Earth where only about .03% of our atmosphere is Co2.  I agree that humans are putting Co2 into the atmosphere  My opponent then states that we are seeing rapid climate changes and that this is unnatural about the current climate change. While we are experiencing rapid rates of climate change, these changes are not unique to Earth. The entire solar system seems to be going through a sort of 'climate-change phase.' Within the last 20 years scientists at NASA and around the world have realized that the planets we are looking at now are different than those in 1900s. This indicates that the entire solar system is in some sort of solar-system wide climate change. For example, the ice caps on Mars are shrinking (indicating warming) and the atmosphere is gaining clouds and ozone, Pluto is experiencing a growth of its mysterious dark spots and is experiencing a 300% increase in atmospheric pressure (indicating warming), Saturn is giving off large amount of x rays and there are new appearances of 'hot spots' in its atmosphere (indicating warming), there have been polar shifts on Uranus and voyager 2 picked up large storm spots In its atmosphere that were not there 50 years ago (indicating warming), Mercury is growing a magnetic field and polar ice caps, Jupiter's plasma clouds melding together in its atmosphere and becoming brighter (this is theorized to have been caused by an 18 degree Celsius warming and this is supported by the new large storm spots appearing on Jupiter for the first time), Venus has had a 2500% increase in green glow which symbolizes oxygen in the atmosphere, and Neptune is experiencing changes in light intensity. A dramatic shift that may be the cause of all these weird interplanetary changes is that the suns magnetic field is increasing in strength. Over the last 100 years, the suns magnetic field has increased by 230%. This increase attracts stardust from the surrounding area and this overflow of stardust may have something to do with this solar-system wide event. This evidence shows how Earth is not the only planet going through a rapid period of climate change. This indicates that something solar-system wide may be to blame for the recent fluctuations in temperature, not Co2.  In addition to this, compared to the past 100,000 years, the rate of temperature increase does not seem to be any more rapid then it has been in the past. For example, look at this graph. In fact, looking at this graph shows that we are seeing even less fluctuations in temperature then we have in the past. This means that the rate of change and increase is unnatural because it is slow, not fast.  I have now disproven all of your claims and look forward to your next argument. No, thank you for the debate :)</t>

Supporting evidence that the claims of manmade global climate change are dramatically overstated: We've seen record total amounts of ice, snow, and cold. Polar bears are thriving. Oceans are rising much less than predicted. -Further note here. I've shown multiple times that the predictions of those claiming manmade climate change is going to destroy the world have been incorrect. If these predictions based on the scientific findings are incorrect, perhaps some of their overall claim is also incorrect. If I said something was going to happen and here's what we expect to see to show it is happening, but then none of my predictions came true, you might assume my overall premise/hypothesis is also incorrect.  Again, I'm not saying manmade climate change is not real. We are warming the client. I, again, take issue with the 'threat' that everyone is blowing out of proportion.  Further evidence: 31,000 Scientists signed a petition saying they do not support CATASTROPIC global warming. (including over 9,000 with PhD's. Perhaps there's more to the story?

    <t>My opponent is correct the Earth's temperature has been hotter a long time ago. This falls into the stage 4a of climate change denial. [2] Meaning my opponent accepts the first part of the resolution but rejects the second half.The problem is not the temperature itself, but the rate of change. High rate of temperature change historically has lead to mass extinction. In summary, species including humans will struggle to adapt to such changes, if adaptation to such a change is even possible. [3]Impact, high rate of temperature change equals mass extinctions, which are a threat. Next my opponent uses information sourced from an ultra conservative website called the dailycaller.com I will first attack the source of the argument and then the argument itself. The dailycaller is an ultra-conservative website. You can verify this yourself by seeing the news story against Hilary placed first on the dailycaller.com.'ultra-conservative Daily Caller' [4]Next, lets take a look at the argument. Basically this is a reiteration of the first argument and again falls into stage 4a of denial. [2]Yes, not all the predictions came true. Yet, the overall premise, that co2 and temperature are rising an alarming rates is true. Thank you for taking the time to debate.

    <t>In this round I will be refuting my opponent's arguments and I will be resupporting my own arguments My opponent stated'First my arguments still stand. I think everyone already knows the Pope is not a climate change scientist.'But what my opponent fails to realize is that quoting the pope is not an argument, an argument needs evidence, the quote from the Pope is not evidence of climate change, rather it is only a claim followed by my opponent's warrant. You can't just quote the pope and call it an argument, thus you have no first argument. The Pope's statement does not further your case (unless he was a climate scientist, then it would)So, because the pope is not a climate researcher I really don't even need to refute his statement but I have done so by showing that the Pope is not a climate scientist. In his first rebuttal my opponent stated that'science has shown repeatably that CO2 emissions increase green house gases', but he shows no specific evidence of this occurring. Then my opponent quotes the EPA 'The main human activity that emits CO2 is the combustion of fossil fuels' However, if this were true then how come the decade long decrease in CO2 was seen, even as fossil fuel combustion increased (In the US alone 3 billion more barrels were used per year). In fact, my opponent conceded that point when he said 'Why CO2 levels happen to drop that year is uncertain', so my opponent has conceded my first point. My opponent stated in rebuttal 2'Argument two is cherry picking.'But he shows no evidence of how it is cherry picking... Thus, this statement ought not to be considered, however I will prove how my second argument was not cherry picking... The definition of cherry picking is 'When only select evidence is presented in order to persuade the audience to accept a position, and evidence that would go against the position is withheld.' [1]However, I have not cherry picked evidence because of the fact that I offered the statistical analysis of two major climate research satellites which have had their results peer reviewed by the scientific community and been found to be accurate. In fact, if I had cherry picked this evidence it would not show the .2 degree warming trend that it did...What is even more ironic is that my opponent goes on to say 'El Nino was responsible for the height of the graph.' But even I conceded that the warming trend was there, in fact my opponent just contradicted his entire case by calling the warming trend that was apparent on the graph; El Nino, a regional, natural phenomena, that has nothing to do with Global Climate Change. So, if El Nino caused the warming trend on the graph, then Global Warming is a hoax because all warming trends over the period of the graph can be explained by El Nino (He said it, I didn't). My opponent in rebuttal 3 stated 'First, any argument that tries to use a regional phenomenon to disprove a global trend is dead in the water. Anthropogenic global warming theory does not predict uniform warming throughout the globe. We need to assess the balance of the evidence.'By definition if the phenomena is not experienced GLOBALLY, then GLOBAL Climate Change is not occurring [1] (simple definition 1)'Second, ice-sheet thickening is not inconsistent with warming! Warmer climates tend toward more precipitation. The Antarctic is one of the most extreme deserts on the planet. As it warms, we would expect it to receive more snow. But even a whopping warming of 20 degrees ' say, from -50 degrees C to -30 degrees C ' would still leave it below freezing, so the snow wouldn't't melt. Thus, an increase in ice mass.'If this is true then how come one of the biggest proponents of Global Warming said that the poles would be ice free by 2013 [2], Leon Penetta once said [while talking about Global Climate Change] 'The melting of the Polar Ice Caps' [3]. There seems to be a consensus among scientists and Global Warming Theorists that the Ice caps will melt when Global Warming occurs. Then How did my opponent find contradictory evidence? He found such evidence because he quoted a man with 0 climate science experience. His sources 4,5, and 6 are written by Coby Beck 'Former musician, turned tree planter, turned software engineer.' [4] So, any quote by him ought to be ignored because it offers no expert value or value of any sort. In fact, my opponent is not even quoting the credible science in some of Beck's blogs, my opponent is quoting Beck's opinions which hold no value. My opponent in his 4th rebuttal quotes the same man again... and his statement ought to be ignored but in another one of my opponent's contradictory statements, he says 'temperature moved first [in relation to CO2]', but if this is true, then how come the IPCC said that CO2 caused temperature to move? Which one is it? Either way my opponent has contradicted Global Warming theory as we are debating it and has negated his own refutation. My opponent's graph is quite interesting. The graph appears to show a correlation between CO2 and Temperature, however there are several occasions of temperature and CO2 acting independently, one major example is 400k years before present when the temperature increased dramatically for a (relatively) short period while CO2 decreased, and then again around 380k years ago where temperature decreased dramatically while CO2 increased. So, my opponent's chart, however intriguing, shows once again, that temperature and CO2 act independently from one another. Now I will Strengthen my original cases1: Fossil Fuels do not cause an increase in CO2 emissions, which makes the first part of the IPCC's basic version of global warming invalidMy opponent has conceded this point (see above for more details)2: Despite common belief the last few years have not been the warmest on recordI have shown my opponent's rebuttal of this claim to be false, and his claim of a logical fallacy to be false, however I'd like to strengthen this point more. USCRN the largest and most advanced climate research network in the US has shown a decade long cooling trend. While the trend is statistically 0, it still shows no evidence of global warming. If the entire world is warming, (definition of Global Warming, see above) then how come the United States isn't? [5]s://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com...; alt='' width='1005' height='551' /gt;Furthering my point, A large integrated network of Argo ocean buoys operated by the British Oceanographic Data Center in combination with satellite-enhanced data reveal no statistical warming. Again I posit the question, If the world is warming, then how come the US AND Britain (and the surrounding ocean) are not. [6] 3: Antarctic Ice was larger than ever in 2012 and 2014, thus the Antarctic Ice caps have not been melting which is thought to be a sideffect of the Global Warming theorySeeing as my opponent's refutation of this point was insufficient, I do not feel the need to strengthen this point. 4: There is no direct link between CO2 Emissions and Temperature IncreasesAs I have refuted my opponent's statements about this point I'd like to point out that my opponent has neglected to mention both of my charts for this point, both of which show an obvious independence between CO2 and Temperature, even over the time span of millions of years of data. Judges, seeing as my opponent has not fulfilled his BoP at this point in the debate you would be required to vote in favor of the Con. I look forward to reading my opponent's next argument, and I'd like to say that I'm enjoying this debate. </t>

    <t>Thank you for posting this debate, I hope to be a worthy opponent!!!!Your argument is based on the pope's opinion as well as a scientific documentaryMy argument will be based on historical evidence as well as current scientific evidence that contradicts the theory of Global Climate ChangeFirst I'd like to clarify that Global Warming and Global Climate Change are the same theory with a different name and I will treat them as such. First, I'd like to define Global Climate Change (or Warming)Thus the theory of Global Climate Change (warming) is - a change in global climate patterns, in particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onward and attributed to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels.I'd like to give a more simplified version of the above statement by giving this general statement released by the IPCC on what Climate Change is 'Increasing fossil fuel causes increasing carbon dioxide in the air; and increasing carbon dioxide in the air causes climate change.'Next, I'd like to refute my opponent's argumentsArgument 1) Pope Francis recognizes climate change and he 'Knows what he is doing and thus man-made global climate change is real and a threat' My Response: Pope Francis has no college degree in science (he does have a 'titulo' as a chemical technician, which is not a college degree) and either way he is not a climatologist and his opinion does not count as an expert's opinion and his opinion is on par with the opinion of world leaders and celebrities... Essentially, his opinion on climate change is just as important as the opinion of Vladimir Putin's, neither count as an expert, but their opinion's count as a World Leader's opinion. Argument 2) An Inconvenient Truth My Response: I will watch the entirety of this movie so I can refute the movie in my next argumentNow I will give my basic arguments1: Fossil Fuels do not cause an increase in CO2 emissions, which makes the first part of the IPCC's basic version of global warming invalidDuring World War II, U.S. oil production increased by 3 billion barrels annually during the war. Both the Allies and the Axis used incredible amounts of oil and the best scientific data available, which is from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, shows that carbon dioxide levels literally 'flat-lined' during the decade between 1940 and 1950 staying at 311.3 PPM and actually going down between 1941 and 1945, (the period that the US was in the war) [1] So, how did burning another 12+ billion barrels of oil not increase CO2???? Because, there is no direct link between oil usage and CO2 emissions in the atmosphere. Of course CO2 is a byproduct of the burning of oil, but that CO2 has had little to no affect on atmospheric CO2 as seen in my example above.2: Despite common belief the last few years have not been the warmest on record... According to the UAH and RSS climate research satellites there had been no warming between the late 90's and 2015 in fact 2014, was only .01 degrees hotter than 2005, and 2013 was only .02 degrees warmer than 2005. The conclusion from the analysis of the data is that while there has been a .05 degree warming trend since 2002, according to researchers that is 'statistically insignificant' [2] The small upward trend from 1978 to 2015 is .2 degrees Celsius and is once again classifiable as statistically insignificant and is not proof of any man made global warming, in fact the lack of a significant upward trend shows not only that global warming predictions on climate and temperatures have been well off, but that there may not be any man made global warming at all. (excuse the site on the chart, woodfortrees.org is not where I got the chart, the source I used for the chart is the one listed as source 2)3: Antarctic Ice was larger than ever in 2012 and 2014, thus the Antarctic Ice caps have not been melting which is thought to be a sideffect of the Global Warming theoryNASA satillites discovered that the antarctic sea ice had reached a new record high in 2012 and then again in 2014, in 2014 it set a record for the largest Antarctic Sea Ice in recorded history [3]. Global Warming theory dictates that the Ice caps would begin to melt at an alarming rate, but if that's the case then how come this has occurred. In fact Al Gore and many Global Warming theorists stated that the ice caps would be completley gone by 2013, when the exact opposite has occurred.The red line in the photo is the largest that the ice had ever been recorded at.4: There is no direct link between CO2 Emissions and Temperature Increaseslook at both of the below charts, the first chart is CO2 and temperature data for the last 750 million years, each blue dot represents the temperature and CO2 levels. What you can see is that the dots are everywhere and seemingly when CO2 is raised the dots tend to be higher, but there are several dots (call them outliers if you wish) that even nearing 5000 PPM CO2 are still cooler than the average Earth Temperature. On top of this, why are there dots near the 1000 PPM range that are higher up on the anomaly range than the dots at 7000 PPM.The Second chart shows CO2 and Temperature from 1999 to 2014, what can be seen is a very, very small trend line which is again considered Statistically Insignificant, showing no proof of a global climate change. (specifically the trend is .00668, which is essentially 0 to statisticians). Both Charts show a lack of evidence with CO2 and Temperature, In fact, it could be said that there is no correlation between CO2 and Temperature Change. However IPCC's definition of Global Climate Change requires such a correlation and if such a correlation is not apparent than Climate Change theory is flawed and thus Global Climate Change would not exist. So, based on all 4 of my points I am in firm negation of the topic in which we are debating. Thank you for reading this argument and looking at my charts!!! I hope you understood it, and I can't to see your next round.I'd like to remind my opponent of his BoP, which because of him being the pro he must prove specifically that Man Made Climate change is real and a threat he must prove this beyond a shadow of a doubt, my BoP is not to disprove Climate Change but rather to cast a shadow of a doubt, similar to a court case the judges must not have ANY SHADOW OF A DOUBT that he has won or they must give me the victory.</t>

    <t>My opponent stated that'First and foremost, my opponent has dropped the issue of the Inconvenient truth documentary' However, my entire case has been in contradiction to the inconvenient truth documentary, as seen when my opponent states 'scientific evidence clearly backs up this claim in the documentary an inconvenient truth', I have offered scientific in direct contradiction to the scientific evidence in the movie, thus I have negated my opponent's ENTIRE argument. ' As for the Pope's contribution, this shows just how much climate change deniers are within the minority.'Seeing as my opponent likes to spew out the term 'fallacy', I will spew out the term band wagon fallacy which this argument is, because The bandwagon fallacy is committed by arguments that appeal to the growing popularity of an idea as a reason for accepting it as true. My opponent has admitted to doing this by sating that 'climate change deniers are within the minority' In my opponent's (rather short) rebuttal he said that I was cherry picking again (in my first argument) He did show that I chose a time fame that best suits me, but that time frame that best suits me shows a DIRECT INDEPENDENCE between oil consumption and CO2 in the atmosphere. This isn't cherry picking because I didn't just show a single year or two of independence I showed an entire decade of data. Not only this, but in my 3rd graph (on my first argument) I showed how CO2 levels has been extremely higher than we've ever seen in humanity's history (in some cases over 8000 PPM well before the industrial revolution). Once again I showed independence between ATMOSPHERIC CO2 and Fossil Fuel Consumption. My opponent doesn't seem to understand my argument that ATMOSPHERIC CO2 has no direct relationship to fossil fuel consumption, he lists the obvious fact that CO2 is released by the burning of fossil fuels, but shows no explanation to why an entire decade (and more) of data shows no relation between fossil fuel consumption and atmospheric CO2, in fact he drops the point in his second argument when he says he cannot explain why this statistic occurred. My opponent's second rebuttal states'My opponent seems to miss the original claim he/she made. I have shown that the overall trend is upwards. El nino was particularly potent in the spike of the graph.'I haven't forgotten any claims that I have made, however my opponent has not shown anything contrary to my original claim, his only counter argument negates his entire argument when my opponent blames the spike in temperature on El Nino, a climate feature unrelated to Global Warming. But again even I admitted there was a slight warming trend since 1978, but if the El Nino spike is removed from the data the trend disappears, so my opponent admits that Global Warming is not the cause of the temperature since 1978. My opponent's third rebuttal states 'The overall tend is hotter. Climate can be difficult to predict, just because not everything predicted came true at the correct time, doesn't destroy the overall premise is false.'However I have shown 3 different examples of a lack of an overall warming trend. My first example being my 1st chart on my first argument, which shows that GLOBALLY the overall warming trend (that there is) is 'statistically insignificant' (since 1978). My second example shows that in the US temperatures are cooling over the last decade. My third example shows that in the North and East Atlantic Ocean, as well as, the British Isles have not experienced any warming. My opponent's fourth rebuttal states'The graph clearly indicates that Co2 and temperature show a strong positive relationship. Yes, there are a few anomalies but that doesn't discredit the theory.'My opponent has offered one singular graph showing a relationship between CO2 and temperature. However, I have pointed out that there are events on his graph that shows an independence between the two variables, on top of this, I have offered TWICE as much evidence in the contrary, which my opponent has neglected to mention, showing independence between the two variables even over millions of years. Again I'd like to crystalize my arguments1: Fossil Fuels do not cause an increase in CO2 emissions, which makes the first part of the IPCC's basic version of global warming invalidMy opponent has not other a sufficient refutation for this argument, because this point refutes the definition of Global Warming, it proves that, as we are debating it, Global Warming is not real and thus not a threat.2: Despite common belief the last few years have not been the warmest on record... My opponent calls this point 'cherry picking' however as I have proven, this is not true, and because my opponent has not offered contrary evidence and because of that this point still stands3: Antarctic Ice was larger than ever in 2012 and 2014, thus the Antarctic Ice caps have not been melting which is thought to be a sideffect of the Global Warming theoryMy opponent's first reputation was to say that the ice caps would not melt if Global Warming occurred, however I have shown that this is false, then my opponent made a refutation that is not in contradiction to anything that I stated, so this point still stands.4: There is no direct link between CO2 Emissions and Temperature IncreasesMy opponent has neglected to mention either of my graphs and my opponent's evidence has been refuted making this point still relevant in this debate. Now I'd like to show why I have won this debate My opponent's arguments have been proven false or a fallacy. My opponent's first 'point' is the pope's quote which I've shown to be worth no value to this debate, and I have proven it to be a bandwagon fallacy. My opponent's second point is the Inconvenient Truth Movie which posits scientific evidence for the theory of Global Warming, However, my entire case is in direct contradiction to this movie and acts as counter evidence and a rebuttal to the movie. So, because both of my opponent's arguments have been proven wrong, and my opponent's refutations have been untrue and unfounded, and I have proven them to be so, Thus, I have won this debate... Judges must vote in favor of the Con because of the overwhelming amount of evidence presented and the lack of evidence for my opponent.  I'd like to thank my opponent for this fun and enlightening debate.</t>

Fossil Fuels do not cause an increase in CO2 emissions, which makes the first part of the IPCC's basic version of global warming invalidThis is overtly false, since science has shown repeatably that CO2 emissions increase green house gases. This is also stage 3c of climate change denial. [3]'The main human activity that emits CO2 is the combustion of fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, and oil) for energy and transportation' [2]From the above statement you can clearly see that burning oil causes green house gases. Why CO2 levels happen to drop that year is uncertain. Yet, from your own graph, you can see that CO2 levels are increasing dramatically. Argument 2 Despite common belief the last few years have not been the warmest on recordArgument two is cherry picking. El nino was responsible for the height of the graph.

But even a whopping warming of 20 degrees ' say, from -50 degrees C to -30 degrees C ' would still leave it below freezing, so the snow wouldn't melt.

[5]4: There is no direct link between CO2 Emissions and Temperature IncreasesThis is stage 3c of climate change denial. [3]''When viewed coarsely, historical CO2 levels and temperature show a tight correlation. However, a closer examination of the CH4, CO2, and temperature fluctuations recorded in the Antarctic ice core records reveals that, yes, temperature moved first.Nevertheless, it is misleading to say that temperature rose and then, hundreds of years later, CO2 rose. These warming periods lasted for 5,000 to 10,000 years (the cooling periods lasted more like 100,000 years!), so for the majority of that time (90% and more), temperature and CO2 rose together. 'show picture of graph if possible.' [6][7]Antartica ice provides supporting evidence due to increase snow fall in sub freezing tempatures. Phew, made me work for the victory.

I have fulfilled my burden of proof with this documentary in round one. As for the Pope's contribution, this shows just how much climate change deniers are within the minority. Argument one, burning of fossil fuels increase Co2.I've shown that the EPA states that burning of fossil fuels increase the greenhouse gas of CO2. I was unable to figure out why CO2 levels dropped during the time interval of 1940-1950. Yet, I did show that by my opponent's same graph CO2 levels have risen dramatically. In 1850 with Co2 at 285.2 ppm and in the year 2011 391.15 ppm. This is a cherry picking fallacy, my opponent has chosen a time frame that best suits him/her despite the obvious overall trend of higher concentrations of CO2.'The two main byproducts of natural gas combustion are carbon dioxide and water vapor' [8]As you can see the combustion of natural gas causes carbon dioxide, Co2 emissions. 2. Despite common belief the last few years have not been the warmest on record... My opponent seems to miss the original claim he/she made. I have shown that the overall trend is upwards. El nino was particularly potent in the spike of the graph.3. Ice in AntarcticaThe overall tend is hotter. Climate can be difficult to predict, just because not everything predicted came true at the correct time, doesn't destroy the overall premise is false. 4. CO2 and temperature are strongly correlated.The graph clearly indicates that Co2 and temperature show a strong positive relationship. Yes, there are a few anomalies but that doesn't discredit the theory. ConclusionsMy opponent relies almost exclusively on cherry picking as a strategy. The overall trend is warmer and Co2 levels are increasing. Thanks for debating.</t>

<h>Global warming is caused by the emission of greenhouse gases . 72% of the totally emitted greenhouse gases is carbon dioxide (CO2), 18% Methane and 9% Nitrous oxide (NOx). Carbon dioxide emissions therefore are the most important cause of global warming. CO2 is inevitably created by burning fuels like e.g. oil, natural gas, diesel, organic-diesel, petrol, organic-petrol, ethanol. The emissions of CO2 have been dramatically increased within the last 50 years and are still increasing by almost 3% each year, see graph below:      Word-wide CO2 emission are steadily increasingGraph 1: CO2-emissions world-wide by year (data from wri.org)  World-wide CO2 emissions and concentrationsGraph 2: CO2 emissions world-wide by year and CO2 concentration in the atmosphere by year  The carbon dioxide is released to the atmosphere where it remains for 100 to 200 years. This leads to an increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere (see above on the right hand side), which in turn causes the average temperature on Earth to raise (see graph below).  Increase of world temperature Chart 3: Increase of global average temperature for the last 20 years (source: wri.org) Recent investigations have shown that inconceivable catastrophic changes in the environment will take place if the global temperatures increase by more than 2° C (3.6° F).

<h>In fact, over the last decade, the rate of climate change has been declining, despite the fact that we use more Co2 emitting energy sources. Now, I believe that Co2 has a small effect on the climate, but there is simply no evidence saying that we will die. And fossil fuels can be used to make countries stronger in the face of the effects some scientists hypothesise will effect them the most. for instance, fossil fuels can actually be used to make stronger structures and communities that can easily bounce back from devastating natural disasters. For instance, there is a correlation between fossil fuel and clean water, this is because fossil fuel can be used to power refineries and the entire pipe system used to get water to the tap. Now, of course all this energy can be found in other energy sources, such as nuclear and hydroelectric, but I suppose that you want to talk about wind and solar right? After all they are free supposedly? Well, not true, in fact, it is quite pricy, just to get the rare resources to make solar panels. But in inclusion to the solar panels and wind power, you'd need a reliable alternate. After all, the sun isn't shining all the time and the wind isn't blowing all the time. This is why despite the fact that Germany has invested so much in solar and wind energy, they have more coal plants then ever. And this in turn has caused some to go in to 'energy poverty' I hope this clears up why we can't elect a president with no experience just because of climate change.  Now, I'd like to talk about the flaws in Jills other plans. She would like to raise taxes on the rich. Of course this sound like a great plan, after all, virtually everyone (including me) thinks the rich should pay their fair share. But the top 10% already pay 70% of government funding. And not only that, but research shows that the laffer curve for the rich indicated that the revenue collected from them INCREACES then taxes on them are DECREASED. Weird right? Well it turns out that when the rich know that less of their money is going to govt, they are far more willing to spend it. This also often indicates that they are putting money into their business, meaning they are probably hiring more people. And luckily for me Gary Johnsons tax plan will allow this to happen.  And again, Jills environmental plan was tried in Germany, and as I said, failed.  Her minimun wage of $15 will put far to may people out of work.

    <t>With the environment becoming increasingly an issue I think its a high time we elect a green party representative. The fact that Jill is both a woman and a Harvard graduate aids her. This is because she will be the first woman president if elected. I think it is high time we break the trend of all male presidents. A Harvard degree is no small task. 'She graduated magna cum laude from Harvard College in 1973, and from Harvard Medical School in 1979.' [0]Compare this to Gary Johnson's degree from the university of New Mexico. 'While studying at the University of New Mexico, Gov. Johnson started a handyman business as means to achieve financial independence. After graduating with a degree in political science in 1975, his company, Big J Enterprises, expanded into remodeling and renovation, and eventually, construction. ' [1]Therefore, there are three areas in which Jill has an advantage over Gary. First she focuses more on the enviorment than Gary. Second, she is a woman, which would make her the first female president. Third, she has a more prestigious degree than Johnson. Why is the environment so important? If we don't act soon, as early as 2034 climate change will be out of control. Meaning only a supreme being could save the human race at that point. 'in fact, the report shows we might exceed a 2 C increase as early as 2034.' [2]We have to act now. The end of days is upon us unless we get our acts together. There can be no liberty, justice, nor freedom for anyone under such conditions. Nevertheless, there is plenty of climate change deniers. Both in elected offices and the masses. [3]'63% of those with no post-school qualifications were unconvinced about the role of humans in producing climate changeUniversity graduates were much more likely to take the opposite view, with 86% agreeing that human activity was responsible' [4]This means 37% of people with no post-school qualifications don't believe in man made climate change. This is huge, we need to bring awareness to as many people as possible and act accordingly. Pope Francis believes climate change is a threat and so do scientists. Meanwhile, Gary seems to take a weak stance on environmental issues. If nothing else electing Jill Stein will send a strong message that climate change is real. The time to act is now before it is too late. </t>

    <t>Pros for JohnsonI would like to first talk about Johnson's time as a republican. While I normally don't find it important to bring up, but people often bring it up, but Johnson's achievements as a Republican are not meaningless just because he is now a Libertarian, for as a republican, Johnson upheld a strictly Libertarian sort of Raegan Coolidge like platform, so nothing really changed except party. Now I would like to talk about his time as governer of New Mexico. He achieved a huge approval ration in a state where democrats out number republicans 2 to 1. He also left a statte previously struggling terribly with budget problems with a huge $1 billion budget surpluss. He also constructed two privately funded prisons, meaning the government doesn't pay for it. He vetoes more costly bills then all other governers combined. He also started a major road building program and shifted medicaid to a more efficient managed care. I think that these show that Johnson would be a very solid choice for presidentCons for Jill Stein Unlike a debate between Ms. Clinton and Mr. Trump, I speculate that this debate will mostly be left up to the pros, not the cons. I can't really criticize Jill Stein to much because she has never held an elective office. Which simply leaves me with lack of experience. We can't simply let someone who has little to no knowledge of how to work in government.  And Jill Stein graduating Harvard cannot be used to soldify her claims, as no political courses were taken, and she only took medical related courses.</t>

Now onto the aspects that Jill loses to Gary Johnson, other than having no political degree and has never holding elective office. First, Gary Johnson will be for better at improving our economy, he would implement the same acts as he did while governor of New Mexico, which left the horribly budgeted state with a huge surplus. Jill has not proven herself prominent in this category, again, because she is not experienced. She also fails to address Americas terrible budget problem. The congressional budget office states that by the end of the 2016 FY, Congress will have gone $534 billion over there budget, as usual. What has Jill agreed to do?</t>

    <t>Your lack of rebuttals makes me think you're stumped. You only responded to one thing I said because you think it is the only important thing I said, and didn't even bother to bring up the evidence I used to support it. You simply said that Co2 levels are higher then we expected. Which is not what I said was expected, what I said is that a warming trend is expected, as we have recently entered an inter galacial period as part of the paleostine ice age. You see, the climate is constantly changing, and my point was that the Co2 theory is becoming more and more flawed. Now you bring up hurricanes, again, this is all part of the warming trend. And anyway, if you really do want to help countries in danger because of hurricanes, then you are on the wrong path. When a developed country gets hit by a hurricane, the effects are far less devastating than when a hurricane or typhoon hits a less developed country. Mainly because of low quality shelter. This causes that country's economy to crash. So if you are really concerned about hurricane damage, then get of the problem of climate change, and focus on bringing those countries out of poverty.  Now on to your claim of Co2 levels. Now, the term carbon emissions is wrong, as it is not just carbon, but carbon dioxide. And every single form of fossil fuel is made of it, and all of that Co2 was once in our atmosphere. And for most of our planets existence, Co2 levels were far higher than they are today. Now, Co2 levels cannot be used to blame your stated problems on. For instance, low plant growth, if anything, can be blamed on low Co2 levels, as the optimal level for plant growth is 4x higher then ours today. And our high levels of Co2, as noted by satellite imagery, are actually making the Earth greener in terms of plant growth, as plants and forests begin to regrow at noticeably fast rates.  Now, I have made legitimate claims and backed them up accordingly, and I would appreciate it if you acknowledge these claims, instead of cherry picking for one group of words to attack.</t>

' The last time there was this much carbon dioxide (CO2) in the Earth's atmosphere, modern humans didn't exist. Megatoothed sharks prowled the oceans, the world's seas were up to 100 feet higher than they are today, and the global average surface temperature was up to 11°F warmer than it is now.As we near the record for the highest CO2 concentration in human history — 400 parts per million — climate scientists worry about where we were then, and where we're rapidly headed now.' [2]As you can see we are about to break the record for highest CO2 concentrations in human history 400 parts per million. All signs indicates the concentration will get higher and higher. Your claim about plants growing faster is also flawed. 'But an unprecedented three-year experiment conducted at Stanford University is raising questions about that long-held assumption. Writing in the journal Science, researchers concluded that elevated atmospheric CO2 actually reduces plant growth when combined with other likely consequences of climate change -- namely, higher temperatures, increased precipitation or increased nitrogen deposits in the soil. ' [3]You dispute mainstream science and popular opinion with weak arguments. Meanwhile human population is still above 7 billion. There is no sign of electric cars becoming main stream, people still eat factory farmed beef, and so forth. Thank you for the debate.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank my opponent for the opportunity to be able to debate this fascinating topic. I have only debates on this subject before in a debate talking about the 97% statistic, and for the sake of time, I will leave a link to that to explain why the 97% statistic is untrue. Now onto the rest. Science is highly unreliable when in the climate sphere. Back in the 70s virtually every scientist agreed that we were going into a massive ice age, and now they have flip flopped and now think the globe is warming. Science has been doing this forever, one weakly supported claim is said so much that it basically becomes fact. Also, reliable science shows that we are coming out of a minor ige age. So this warming trend it natural. Also, the climate is constantly changing, and it has been doing so since it was formed billions of years ago. For us to think that it is controllable or that we caused it is completely unethical. My whole point is that science argues more against climate change then for it, and it's not that hard to understand, its really common sense.  Also, I understand that ice is melting and sea levels are rising. But a recent study shows that while arctic sea ice is melting antarctic sea ice is expanding. Another study shows that the sea level rise rate has decreased.  And your comment to the pope is completely irrational. The Pope's opinion is not fact, just because he is a figure head for the Catholic church doesn't mean he speaks for it. You can be Catholic and still disagree with what the pope says.  Basically, science says that the warming trend is natural and expected, we are coming out of a little ice age and we will be fine, the Roman Warm period was warmer and they had no carbon emissions to blame it on, just because things are changing and the public didn't know enough to expect it doesn't mean we blame it on something based on the first half-baked argument we hear.</t>

    <t>The greenhouse effect is a thing, and hypothetically it would raise temperatures. But adding more and more to our atmosphere does not infinitely raise the temperature, it only raises it to an extent. Yet again I see you have ignored the very important claim that we are coming out of a galatial period, which explains the warming trend, and everything you think it has caused.  Also, few climate scientists actually worry where we are headed, those are environmental activists, corrupt politicians, and a few scientists hired specifically to prove it is man made. In most cases, you will see that studies that indicate a rapid change are botched, as seen in my 97% debate.  And may I ask you some questions you are free to answer in the comments, what have you done. Are you yelling about a problem you are part of? Do you drive an electric car? Do you plant? Have you actually gone out as I have and contribute to a worthy solution?  And what does population have anything to do with climate change?  Also, may I end with an argument that I may have benifited from starting with. The only constant is change. When the media makes these claims, they leave so much out of the picture. As you have done with my arguments. They take one thing, leave out the rest, which makes it easy to destroy its foundation. If we actually see the whole picture, and know the problem for what it is, then we can come up with actual solutions that can make an actual change. Not just weak EPA political action.

The places that usually have hurricanes have more intense hurricanes. Remember hurricane Katrina? That hurricane was more intense due to global climate change.

    <t>Thanks for the debate and good luck!  My opponent unfortunately makes some shallow assumptions, in that they believe Donald Trump legitimately believes everything he's said. Remember, my opponent has the burden of proof, and as such must prove beyond reasonable doubt that Trump actually believes this during the course of this debate. Failure to do so means a lack of his fulfillment of his burden of proof and thus means the negative wins the debate. I don't need to show that Trump DOESN'T believe this, just show that there isn't enough evidence to demonstrate that he does. I can further explain the burden of proof in a later round if this becomes an issue or is confusing somehow, but I'll leave this where it is for now and move onto my main contentions.  As I said earlier, my opponent just quotes Trump at face value and assumes that is enough to assert that this is what he believes. However, it's a well known fact that politicians in general will fake beliefs to pander to a specific audience. Looking back at his history as a candidate, it's common knowledge that Trump already had his supporters locked down early in the republican primaries and really couldn't do anything to lose his supporters, even claiming he could shoot someone in the middle of the road and not lose support. A potential reason for him faking belief in climate change then could be to pander to Cruz supporters, of which only 38% believed in climate change. This is a clear reason for Trump to pander to a specific audience in order to get votes, which gives us a motivation for Trump's actions. Trump even has told people that he has a strategy of saying odd things in order to attract the audience of different groups. Take for example what Carson reported after discussing the matter with Trump himself: 'I needed to know that he could listen to other people, that he could change his opinions, and that some of the more outlandish things that he's said, that he didn't really believe those things,' Carson said. When asked which statements Trump might back away from, Carson demurred'. 'I'll let him talk about that because I don't think it's fair for me to relay a private conversation,' he said. How can my opponent say for certain that Trump fully believes this if there's evidence of him saying that he'll back away from some of the more outlandish claims, and that he doesn't necessarily believe all of it? My opponent even recognized in the comments section that this is a somewhat outlandish and silly claim for Trump to make. We've seen Trump back away from policies such as the muslim ban, so why assume that this is his actual belief? Unfortunately my opponent uses mostly personal speculation and does not consider the large body of compelling evidence casting doubt over Trump's actual beliefs.  With that I'll give pro a chance to respond to my contentions. Thank you!</t>

The fact that Donald Trump words suggest that Donald Trump thinks Climate Changeis a hoax does not matter. I'll accept that. Politicians are know to lie.

    <t>Alright...  So first of all, the burden of proof means YOU have the burden of demonstrating your claim to be true beyond a reasonable doubt. *I* just have to demonstrate that it's not necessarily true. Dividing it into percentages or fractions doesn't make any sense. Think of it like a courtroom, the defense is just trying to refute the claims of the prosecution, and doesn't carry a higher burden than that.  Anyway, my contentions haven't been addressed at all... My opponent just re-read another statement with Trump saying he doesn't believe in climate change but my original contention already refutes that as it discredits the words of Trump and actually looks deeper into his intentions as a presidential candidate.

    <t>Ok so my opponent conceded the first 2 rounds of the debate and decided to bring a completely new contention the very last round. The problem here is that he also basically concedes that if I were to demonstrate that Trump is greedy enough to just not care about it then that's sufficient to win the debate.  A quick Google search reveals an article in which Trump literally states 'I am very greedy' [1]  It's a well known fact that Trunp is excessively greedy, he even says it himself. He's a businessman who brags about his wealth constantly. Why not assume that he's greedy enough to do this? My opponent doesn't provide any counter evidence to his immense greed over the course of the debate and concedes that he'll go to excessive measures for more power so I suggest that this refutes his contentions.

<h>Addressing the first prong of my argument concerning the leftward lean of journalists generally and the St. Petersburg/Tampa Bay Times specifically, Conservative Democrat wrote:  '(T)his doesn't prove that PoliticFact [sic] is biased unless we have other evidence as well.'  The debate challenge does not ask for proof. The debate challenge asks whether PolitiFact has a liberal bias. The bias among journalists and at PolitiFact's parent newspaper offer reasonable grounds for thinking PolitiFact leans left. The first prong is not meant as proof, for the debate challenge does not require proof.  It's a bit late to amend the rules of the debate, such as they are.  Addressing my second prong, regarding PolitiFact's failure to provide a principled distinction between its 'False' and 'Pants on Fire' ratings, Conservative Democrat wrote:  'No, they did state why they give some claims False and some Pants on Fire. (...) For example; False claim: I am leading over my opponent in Poll A - But you were not leading; Pants on Fire: I am leading in every poll - But your opponent actually is beating you in many polls.'  Where I inserted the ellipsis, Conservative Democrat simply repeated the description of the ratings like one I had already supplied. The remainder of Conservative Democrat's answer offers example as a substitute for principle. But why is a string of wrong statements not merely wrong but in addition 'ridiculous'? PolitiFact never states any such difference in terms of principle. When pressed on the matter during a 2014 podcast interview, PolitiFact editor Angie Drobnic Holan said '(T)he line between 'False' and 'Pants on Fire' is just, you know, sometimes we decide one way and sometimes decide the other' (1). Her statement does not provide any principled distinction between one rating and the other.  Providing an example in rebuttal without identifying the principle in the example counts as a failed rebuttal.  Again addressing the second prong, this time in terms of the PolitiFact's tendency to more likely grade Republican false statements 'Pants on Fire' than those of Democrats, Conservative Democrat wrote (accounting for the next few sections of quoted text):  'Regardless of whether the rating is subjective or not, there is still a reason for this.'  If the reasons follow no objective principle then the ratings are effectively subjective and the disparity in the ratings shows PolitiFact's liberal bias.  'Republicans are generally more religious then liberals, so many don't believe in evolution.'  PolitiFact rarely rates claims touching the issue of evolution. If Conservative Democrat can offer as much as one example of such rated 'Pants on Fire' then the point would be at least slightly interesting. But even then it does not turn my third prong.  'Many also don't believe in Global Warming.'  Conservative Democrat might have cited that factoid to PolitiFact. Unfortunately, the example plays to my advantage in this debate. PolitiFact does not bring scientific rigor to its ratings on global warming, and in fact sometimes reverses its rating principles on the topic. PolitiFact uses a 'burden of proof' standard in its statement of principles. If politician does not support a claim and PolitiFact cannot support it with evidence, PolitiFact calls the claim false (2). Yet a Democrat can say 'It is true that there's virtually no Republican who accepts the science that virtually is unanimous' and PolitiFact gives it a 'Mostly True' rating despite the fact that most Republicans have offered no statement of their beliefs on climate change (3). PolitiFact will sometimes simply trash its own principles in favor of a popular public narrative. When a Republican does not offer a position on climate change, does it follow that the Republican does not accept the science? Is that logical? When a fact-checker abandons its principles to favor one side of a debate, it's a solid sign of bias.  '(M)ore Republicans will get fact checked, so more of them will make 'Pants on Fire' statements.'  The research takes that into account. It does not look merely at which party receives more 'Pants on Fire' ratings but instead at which party's false statements are more likely to receive 'Pants on Fire' statements. If the proportions were equal, Republicans could have 20 times more 'Pants on Fire' statements but the research would show no evidence of bias by that measure. Conservative Democrat misstates the nature of the evidence.  'Liberals are generally more intelligent then conservatives'  What's the relevance, other than affording the opportunity to use a citation? If it's not relevant, it's not an intelligent move to include that factoid.  'So why would the apparently liberal PoliticFact [sic] allow PoliticFact [sic] Wisconsin to not be liberally biased? What is more likely is that the claims Wisconsin Democrats make are more likely to be false then the Republican statements.'  How would PolitiFact National stop PolitiFact Wisconsin from favoring Republicans in its selections of 'Pants on Fire' statements? There's no use asking why if there's no how. The notion that Wisconsin Democrats are more likely to make false statements lacks any evidence in support (using PolitiFact statistics would beg the question), and more importantly Conservative Democrat should note that both 'False' and 'Pants on Fire' ratings supposedly indicate false statements. It doesn't solve the mystery to say that Wisconsin Democrats more likely make more false claims. That's irrelevant to a disparity in the chances of the application of the 'Pants on Fire' rating.  Turning attention to the third prong of my argument, Conservative Democrat wrote:  'First off, PoliticFact didn't use, 'The wrong denominator nine times.' Your source says they miscalculated 9 times.'  There's no discrepancy. Using the wrong denominator results in a miscalculation of percentage error (4). My source says as much, but in different words ('It is incorrect to divide by the incorrect estimate, 175 lbs' (5)). The thing you divide by is the denominator.  'If this site was liberally biased, why even allow the republicans any bonuses?'  That was explained. Wrong procedures by poor fact checkers are more likely to favor the fact-checker's ideology. 'More likely' does not mean 'exclusively.' Lack of bias would mean no pattern of one party receiving more unfair harm than the other. Any other understanding represents a straw man.  'we don't get any links to the miscalcuations [sic].  The source links to a spreadsheet that identifies every case in question.  'There were 6 calculation errors (apparently) that helped Democrats. This means they have a .9% chance of making an error in favor of a Democrat.'  That statement shows a lack of understanding of the research. The search strand provided a suitably random sample of PolitiFact's work looking for one type of calculation. A sample looking for special cases. Your conclusion doesn't follow at all.  'Look at the democratic chart on this website. That hardly looks like they are helping democrats much.'  That's unresponsive to the point. We have no baseline from which to judge the fairness of the charts. Your opinion is only evidence of your opinion. Maybe the Democrats made more false claims.  Conservative Democrat dealt briefly with my fourth prong:  'A) You didn't show how this is a liberal bias.'  Did. 'If PolitiFact National's worst work favors Democrats over Republicans, then it serves as an evidence of PolitiFact National's liberal bias.'  'B) You are focusing on an unrelated part of this fact check.'  Biased fact-checkers are more likely to commit and sustain a blunder that agrees with their bias. How is that not related?  'C) This is out of context.'  Based on what evidence? How can rising costs ever reduce a deficit in any context?  'Government spending stimulates the economy.'  The only way that could lead to deficit reduction is when taxes are collected on the increased economic activity (revenue, just like I said). But you don't get back more than you spend, do you?  'D) Again, what does this mean? You didn't explain how this proves a liberal bias.'  Do I need to repeat myself? PolitiFact's apparent incompetence favored the liberal position. I don't need proof. I just need reasonable evidence, as I've already explained.  As this stage of the debate shows, Conservative Democrat has failed to refute any prong of my argument. PolitiFact's institutional bias probabilistically shows a liberal bias, two research projects show strong evidence of PolitiFact's liberal bias, and Conservative Democrat has no counter to my anecdotes.  Conservative Democrat summarized: 'So of these 4, you failed to back up 2 of them, one of these 'biases' is out of context, and the other one is nitpicking.'

I said that if you do not refute each prong of my argument then you need your own affirmative evidence. That's perfectly true, despite your (straw man) hint that I improperly shift the burden of proof.

You haven't refuted any part of my argument (evidence in my reply above), nor have you provided your own affirmative case. Based on our arguments, it is reasonable to conclude that PolitiFact has a liberal bias. All of the evidence is on my side.</t>

    <t>I offer thanks to 'Conservative Democrat' for extending this challenge. PolitiFact's leftward lean does not yet receive the full attention it deserves, so I appreciate the opportunity to make the case.  The fact checkers at PolitiFact, referring to PolitiFact National, have a liberal bias. My argument will make this clear based on a preponderance of the evidence. While that should prove sufficient for the argument to succeed based on the terms of the debate, this argument should also convince the audience beyond a reasonable doubt that PolitiFact National has a liberal bias.  What's the evidence?  First, American journalists as a group are to the left of the general U.S. population (1). Second, PolitiFact was created by the St. Petersburg Times (now the Tampa Bay Times), a newspaper with a notable history of partiality to the left. For example, the newspaper has never in over 100 years endorsed a Republican in the general presidential election (2). The most important evidence, though, comes from PolitiFact's content, not from the likely predispositions of its writers and editors or the editorial history of its parent newspaper. Three lines of evidence together make a strong case that the liberal lean at the Times manifests itself in PolitiFact's fact checking. The first two lines come from research. The third derives from PolitiFact's poorest attempts at fact-checking, which tend to unfairly harm Republicans while sparing Democrats.  The first research project (3) uses PolitiFact's rating scale to show unjustified harm to Republicans compared to Democrats. The research focuses on the difference between the 'False' and 'Pants on Fire' Truth-O-Meter ratings.  A continuing research project I designed provides a powerful evidence of the bias at PolitiFact National. PolitiFact's failure to provide any objective means of distinguishing between its 'False' and 'Pants on Fire' ratings strongly suggests the ratings reflect an editorial opinion about select statements PolitiFact finds false. PolitiFact decides its ratings based on the vote of three (possibly more) editors (4). The research project randomly surveyed about a quarter of PolitiFact's 'Pants on Fire' ratings in search of an unstated objective principle justifying the ratings. The findings showed nothing close to a consistent result, supporting the hypothesis that PolitiFact has no objective justification backing its 'Pants on Fire' ratings (5).  The 2012 study showed the apparently subjective 'Pants on Fire' rating was 74 percent more likely to fall on a Republican false statement than a Democrat false statement, covering the years from 2007 through 2011. At the end of 2014, updated statistics showed that Republicans were still 74 percent more likely to have their false (by PolitiFact's reckoning) statements rated 'Pants on Fire' than those of Democrats (6).  The same research approach was applied to other PolitiFact franchises, including its state and 'PunditFact' franchises. The franchises that deliver the most robust volume of data show fairly consistent trends which do not necessarily track with the trend at PolitiFact National. PolitiFact Wisconsin, for example, tends to give Democrats' false statements harsher treatment than those from Republicans by more likely giving them the 'Pants on Fire' designation (7).  The other research project was based on reasoning that journalists could be expected to make a common math error more often in cases where the error favored their ideology. Using the often-made error of using the wrong denominator when calculating percentage error, the research project used a search routine to collect a set of PolitiFact stories that might contain percentage error calculations. The research approach turned up a small sample of stories with that equation present, yet the results were lopsided. Out of 14 examples reasonably classified as percentage error calculations, PolitiFact used the wrong denominator nine times (8).  Out of those nine errors, six either unfairly harmed a Republican or helped a Democrat. Three either helped a Republican or harmed a Democrat (9).  The third line of evidence comes from an examination of PolitiFact National's poorest work. If PolitiFact National's worst work favors Democrats over Republicans, then it serves as an evidence of PolitiFact National's liberal bias. The strength of that evidence depends on the strength of the anecdotes offered in illustration. I'll provide examples as space allows.  A) PolitiFact Florida ruled that a Republican candidate raised his own pay a number of times while serving in the U.S. House of Representatives (10) A later parallel fact check by PolitiFact Ohio rated a Republican candidate's claim that his Democratic opponent had raised his own pay in the House. The reason? PolitiFact Ohio correctly said the rules prevent representatives from raising their own pay (11). Though it involves PolitiFact Florida, this example contributes to the argument because the writer (Louis Jacobson) principally writes for PolitiFact National (12).  B) A PolitiFact defense of the ACA absurdly counted the ACA's projected deficit reductions as spending cuts to help justify rating the ad of a conservative group 'False.' PolitiFact claimed the Congressional Budget Office said the ACA would cut spending by $124 billion (13). But the CBO actually said the ACA would cut the budget deficit by $124 billion (14). Spending is not the same as the budget deficit. This PolitiFact Florida item was written by Angie Drobnic Holan, now chief editor at PolitiFact.  C) PolitiFact found it 'Mostly True' President Obama's claim that health care was the single biggest factor driving down the budget deficit, despite the fact that health care costs were increasing (15). The only things that can shrink the budget deficit are costs that drop or revenues that go up. Slowing the growth of a category of costs does not decrease the budget deficit (16).  D) During one of his State of the Union addresses, President Obama mentioned the 23-cent gender wage gap, called it 'wrong' and said women deserve equal pay for equal work. PolitiFact ruled that Obama was correct that a 23-cent wage gap exists, docking him only for an apples-to-oranges aspect of the statistic. PolitiFact said Obama's call for equal pay for equal work was not part of his gender pay gap claim, excusing the former as 'aspirational' (17). The Washington Post Fact Checker disagreed, finding Obama implied the gap was relevant to gender discrimination (18).  In the space remaining, I'll address the argument that PolitiFact gives Republicans worse rating as a group than Democrats.  By itself, more poor ratings for Republicans says essentially nothing about bias at PolitiFact. Bad ratings for Republicans might occur because Republicans make more false statements. However, when we consider Republicans' poor record with PolitiFact in context, it serves as an additional, albeit weak, evidence of PolitiFact's liberal bias.  It is important to note that we have no scientifically supported baseline for which political party makes more false claims. So when PolitiFact rates Republicans more harshly than Democrats, it supports no reasonable prediction about PolitiFact's ratings matching a known tendency. On the other hand, knowing that journalists lean left makes it reasonable to predict that if that bias affects PolitiFact's ratings then it may result in harsher ratings for Republicans. The harsh ratings for Republicans support a prediction associated with the hypothesis that PolitiFact has a liberal bias.  So, it is reasonable to conclude that PolitiFact has a liberal bias because journalists tend to lean left, two research approaches support the idea, and PolitiFact's most glaring mistakes tend to unfairly harm Republicans or aid Democrats.  Conservative Democrat will need to either refute each prong of the argument or instead provide affirmative evidence of either PolitiFact's neutrality or its conservative bias, otherwise it is more reasonable to accept that PolitiFact has a liberal bias.  Thanks again to Conservative Democrat for issuing this challenge.</t>

    <t>Thank you for accepting! I hope we can have an interesting discussion.  'First, American journalists as a group are to the left of the general U.S. population (1). Second, PolitiFact was created by the St. Petersburg Times (now the Tampa Bay Times), a newspaper with a notable history of partiality to the left. For example, the newspaper has never in over 100 years endorsed a Republican in the general presidential election.' - True this may be, but this doesn't prove that PoliticFact is biased unless we have other evidence as well.  'The findings showed nothing close to a consistent result, supporting the hypothesis that PolitiFact has no objective justification backing its 'Pants on Fire' ratings.' -No, they did state why they give some claims False and some Pants on Fire. They give False to statements that are just wrong, but not ridiculous. They give Pants on Fire to claims that are ridiculous and wrong. For example; False claim: I am leading over my opponent in Poll A - But you were not leading; Pants on Fire: I am leading in every poll - But your opponent actually is beating you in many polls. 'The 2012 study showed the apparently subjective 'Pants on Fire' rating was 74 percent more likely to fall on a Republican false statement than a Democrat false statement, covering the years from 2007 through 2011. At the end of 2014, updated statistics showed that Republicans were still 74 percent more likely to have their false (by PolitiFact's reckoning) statements rated 'Pants on Fire' than those of Democrats (6). - Regardless of whether the rating is subjective or not, there is still a reason for this. Republicans are generally more religious then liberals, so many don't believe in evolution. Many also don't believe in Global Warming. PoliticFact believes those things are true, so they rate those claims accordingly. Another thing to consider, there are more Republicans then Democrats in congress, so more Republicans will get fact checked, so more of them will make 'Pants on Fire' statements. Republicans probably make more bogus claims, so they will get fact checked more.  'The same research approach was applied to other PolitiFact franchises, including its state and 'PunditFact' franchises. The franchises that deliver the most robust volume of data show fairly consistent trends which do not necessarily track with the trend at PolitiFact National. PolitiFact Wisconsin, for example, tends to give Democrats' false statements harsher treatment than those from Republicans by more likely giving them the 'Pants on Fire' designation (7).' - Liberals are generally more intelligent then conservatives. So why would the apparently liberal PoliticFact allow PoliticFact Wisconsin to not be liberally biased? What is more likely is that the claims Wisconsin Democrats make are more likely to be false then the Republican statements.' 'The other research project was based on reasoning that journalists could be expected to make a common math error more often in cases where the error favored their ideology. Using the often-made error of using the wrong denominator when calculating percentage error, the research project used a search routine to collect a set of PolitiFact stories that might contain percentage error calculations. The research approach turned up a small sample of stories with that equation present, yet the results were lopsided. Out of 14 examples reasonably classified as percentage error calculations, PolitiFact used the wrong denominator nine times. Out of those nine errors, six either unfairly harmed a Republican or helped a Democrat. Three either helped a Republican or harmed a Democrat.' -First off, PoliticFact didn't use, 'The wrong denominator nine times.' Your source says they miscalculated 9 times. It also says that of these 14 claims, 2 were ambiguous, and 3 were correct. So we are down to 9 miscalculations. And of those, 3 helped republicans. If this site was liberally biased, why even allow the republicans any bonuses? Plus, we don't get any links to the miscalcuations, probably because PoliticFact fixed their errors, like any site would. Next, PolitiFact has done at least 1000 fact checks. There were 6 calculation errors (apparently) that helped Democrats. This means they have a .9% chance of making an error in favor of a Democrat. That doesn't seem biased at all. Also, your source is 'PolitiFactBias.' That doesn't seem like an unbiased source.  'It is important to note that we have no scientifically supported baseline for which political party makes more false claims. So when PolitiFact rates Republicans more harshly than Democrats, it supports no reasonable prediction about PolitiFact's ratings matching a known tendency. On the other hand, knowing that journalists lean left makes it reasonable to predict that if that bias affects PolitiFact's ratings then it may result in harsher ratings for Republicans. The harsh ratings for Republicans support a prediction associated with the hypothesis that PolitiFact has a liberal bias.' -Look at the democratic chart on this website. That hardly looks like they are helping democrats much. Just under 1/2 of the democratic claims are 1/2 false, mostly false, false, and pants on fire. The republican circle is much more to the negative, but as the source points out, there are many Republicans that make ridiculous claims, and those people are quite popular, so they will get fact checked. A) You didn't show how this is a liberal bias. B) You are focusing on an unrelated part of this fact check. Anyway, their point is that this legislation won't cost as much as the Republicans were saying. C) This is out of context. Read the fact check. They are saying that healthcare now will reduce the deficit in the long run. Plus, you just used this example in B, but now you are calling it false? Government spending stimulates the economy. D) Again, what does this mean? You didn't explain how this proves a liberal bias.  So of these 4, you failed to back up 2 of them, one of these 'biases' is out of context, and the other one is nitpicking.  So I believe I have rebutted your arguments. I see in your argument that you want me to provide evidence for my side. I don't need to do this. You have the burden of proof. It is not my job to prove PoliticFact is not biased, when no evidence to the contrary exists. If I worded the resolution as, 'PoliticFact is not liberally biased', I would have the BoP. But since you have the positive position, you have to prove your side.  Thank you for accepting! Good luck in the final round!</t>

    <t>I'm too lazy to write rules.  I have seen this multiple times; the website Politifact haas liberal bias. Evidence? They rate more claims by conservatives false then they do liberals. To me, this doesn't show any bias. It just shows more conservatives say false or ludicrous things. For example, Donald Trump is often fact checked, which will obviously increase the amount of false conservative claims. For example, Donald Trump believes climate change is a Chinese hoax. Liberals just don't say things like that on the same frequency as conservatives. Also, since our political spectrum is so far to the right, we don't see many insane far-left claims, because that position isn't represented in the media or by politicians. And since our spectrum is on the right, more conservatives will make claims then liberals, so more conservatives will get fact checked, as they have more claims. I believe I have madey point. Good luck to whoever accepts this short debate.</t>

    <t>Environmental law has developed in response to emerging awareness and concern over issues impacting the globe. 'Beginning in the 1970s, Congress enacted a set of laws to protect the nation's air, water and lands from uncontrolled pollution. These laws responded to the consequences of unregulated industrial development that had fouled those resources to the point where rivers were not fishable, air was unhealthy to breathe, and land contamination put Love Canal at the forefront of national consciousness. Over time, environmental regulation has been very successful at reducing the amount of pollution Americans face every day' [1].  The Clean Air Act is the principle law addressing air pollution including carbon dioxide emissions. 'In 2002, a report by the Journal of American Medical Association credited the act's automobile emission regulations with reducing carbon monoxide related deaths, saving 11,700 lives between 1968 and 1998' [2]. Similarly, the Montreal Protocol Act could be preventing 11 billion tons of CO2 from entering Earth's atmosphere [3]. These laws have made it easier for people to breathe and are crucial to our well being.  President Nixon signed the Clean Water Act in 1972, the primary federal law addressing water quality standards for the nation's waterways. Most importantly, this act puts the onus on states to develop plans to protect their watersheds from non-point pollution [2]. Still, a 2009 study by Duke University concluded that while water quality has improved, 'population growth, limited jurisdiction, and unforeseen water stressors, such as emerging contaminants and climate change' nevertheless plague our waters. This means regulation and enforcement of those regulations is still very relevant to our health and the well-being of our planet.  We know that there is a great deal of stress on our environment that puts the livelihood of both animals and humans in danger. Yet people still tend to behave selfishly or in their own (financial) self-interest. 'The tragedy of the commons is an economic theory of a situation within a shared-resource system where individual users acting independently according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting that resource through their collective action' [4].  To prevent people from ruining the environment for their personal gain, prosecuting environmental crimes has become routine to serve as a deterrent. Pro would have to explain how education alone serves as a useful deterrent. </t>

The link is http://www.conserve-energy-future.com......As I've shown before, the author of the article doesn't give any sort of conclusion. He gives 5 reasons why it's true, and 5 reasons why it's not. Not only that, but for his '50% more arctic ice' point, he doesn't give us any sources! This is ElmerB all over again!2) The global sea levels rose about 6.7 inches in the last century. The source is http://www.conserve-energy-future.com...... and if the rate of rising sea level remains same, it won't be having much effect. Also, it may promote development of underwater cities as they would have to do it for survival.But that's the problem, the sea levels are rising faster than they used to be! Instead of 6.7 inches in a year, the article I've linked indicates it will rise far more than 6.7 inches (1). Con also states, 'It may promote development of underwater cities as they would have to do it for survival.' I thought we were going to try and solve global warming, not run away from it.3) We must find a viable replacement of fossil fuels rather than targeting the removal of co2. If production of co2 continues at this level, what will be the use of reducing it through plants and stuff when we can directly attack the source? It is just like instead of plugging a leak in a ship, we take a bucket and keep throwing the water away. First we must tackle the leak, then we can clean up the ship.I have an analogy for you. Let's say your sink is leaky. You find where it is leaking, and you see a hole in a pipe. Instead of just ordering a replacement part, you need to find a way deal with the leak before the replacement part arrives! Analogies aside, who says we can't do both? I've already stated my plan (fertilizing the sea in order to create algal blooms). The U.S. Government is working on converting algae into a bio fuel with success (2). In other words, we can solve the global warming problem, and then harvest the algae once the pollutants are absorbed out of the atmosphere. 4) Yes, but the point I want to make is that fossil fuels are a finite resource and must be saved for later generations, or we will run out of it sooner or later. The predictions may or may not be accurate, but we all know that production of fossil fuel is not possible. We have to drill under the Earth to find their reserves. If there is a way to make sure energy production continues, we must take more concrete steps towards finding new sources of energy.We are (see above). But these steps are not economically or environmentally feasible yet, and the CO2 we produce is still an issue (3). Also, why do you think we should 'save some fossil fuels for later generations?' I thought you wanted to develop different alternatives to fossil fuels altogether.5) 'I've already shown how global warming is a reality, and you accept that'Just for this debate. Otherwise it will become a separate debate, and we will divert from the crux of the debate.Strange, because in every round thus far (including this one), you have linked 'evidence for why global warming isn't true.' I don't think you're telling the truth to the judges here. Examples:'Has co2 really increased that much, or is there another reason? And are the readings of 1900's even correct?

Should we start killing people? No.6) But instead if we tackle the source, naturally even with the number of plants we have right now co2 will be gradually reduced and temperatures would recede to normal. 'Normal.'

Weather science is still flawed and developments are still occurring, how can we rely that readings of previous unadvanced centuries were correct and that this century is really colder than before? Diversion-Fallacious argument. 'There is no way to prove that the sources are correct, and therefore, global warming isn't true.' Fallacy of ignorance (they haven't dis/proven it, so it must be true/false).8) Fossil fuels have not been used properly until the industrial revolution, when machines required power that was generated from fossil fuels, and drills were made that could find new reservoirs of oil. 'Until Mad Max becomes a reality, no one will be killing each other over a gallon of gasoline or a watt of electricity.' Yet we know the unrest in the Middle East is because nations want to take control of the oil reservoirs. It is also because some Arabic countries believe Israel isn't entitled to the land they were given by the UN. It is also because of terrorist activity. It is also because of bad rulers, dictators. The article I've linked at the bottom talks about how it is not only oil that causes unrest in the Middle East (4).9) Worse still, fossil fuels can't be synthetically produced in lab, at least without wasting more resources than it is worth. Say if there was a way to utilize the energy of fossil fuel without burning it and causing pollution, how valuable and eco-friendly would fossil fuels become? And if a new energy source that would be renewable and cost efficient was invented, wouldn't people remark burning stuff for energy as archaic? We already have a solution to decrease co2, we must at the very least find a solution to meet the energy demands, should we not?See in my round 2 argument on algal blooms and how they a) solve the global warming problem, and b) can be converted into energy once carbon dioxide levels subside.Now, closing.Global warming is too big of a problem to ignore.We pollute this world. My opponent agrees. However, we disagree on how to solve it. Con would like you to believe that focusing on fossil fuels is all one has to do in order to combat global warming. This is far from the truth. We must first combat the emission, and then the source. We, the human race, are responsible for two million deaths a year due to our carelessness when it comes to air pollution (5). That's not even counting land and water pollution! We must combat the emissions, as they are simply to dangerous to let 'gradually reduce,' as is Con's plan. Instead, we must focus on absorbing these pollutants out of the atmosphere by encouraging growth of certain plants.

    <t>1) Yes, the fuel shortage won't kill lives, but it would make survival difficult, as energy production would be severely affected. However, currently global warming isn't killing anyone as such, yes the Polar bears are losing some habitat, but according to my sources Arctic ice had increased from 2010, which is contrary to the expectations of global warming experts. For the temperature to be above the limit for our survival would take a lot more time than for fuel sources to be drained.First off: 'according to my sources Artic ice had increased from 2010, which is contrary to the expectiations of global warming experts.' What sources? Who wrote them? Are they up to date? Second, 'For the temperature to be above the limit for our survival would take a lot more time than for fuel sources to be drained.' Actually, it's not the temperature, it's the water! According to the National Wildlife Federation, 'New science published after the IPCC report has shown how global warming is happening faster than anticipated (1).' I recomend you read the article I'll link to this argument.2) We must work on devising alternative clean and efficient sources of energy rather than JUST planting trees.'You have agreed to this point.Not exacly. If you look through my Round 1 argument, I say I agree with you when it comes to 'JUST planting trees.' I then go on to state that trees are not the primary factor when it comes to cleaning up the enivironment. In other words, this statement you made is grossly overversimplfiying the problem that global warming is. Seeing as you may have been confused with my argument in round 1, I'll state it now: I dissagree with this point.3) Moreover, dealing with the fuel crisis will reduce global warming as well as vehicles cause pollutionYou say vehicles cause 34.9 percent of co2 emissions. What do factories and businesses use? Fuel, or in short electricity. Electricity production happens through clean sources like dams, solar panels and stuff, but also through nuclear reactors and generators. Generators take fuel. That adds up as well. Plus, does gasoline count as a fuel source? If it does, then its burning and production also cause pollution. Dealing with the fuel crisis will definitely impact global warming.And how is that electricity generated, Con? There's a scientific formula, in case you are unaware: Motion + Magnetism = Electricity. The most common way to get that motion is by using fossil fuels. Not hydropower, not solar panels, but fossil fuels. Annother limited resource. According to the EIA, renewables (Neuclear, hydropower, and other renewables) produce 1/3 of all electric power in the US (2). We are already formulating clean energy sources, as you would call them, and yet global warming is still occuring!4) Also, some of these links believe global warming may not be true.....Your final site redirects me to an article written by the one and only expert on the subject: Elmer B. I recommend you read this article in it's full extentI read the article, it gives ten reasons why climate change is a hoax.I'm glad you read your own article, but what I'm attacking is ElmerB's credibility as an expert on the subject of global warming. Using his article as proof is like finding annother debate on DDO and using their argument. He's a lay witness to the effects of global warming, and his 'findings' should not be treated as evidence.5) The facts on this site are mostly predictions about the future effects of global warming, and data from the previous century that could have been moulded due to outliers, such as location and the weather cycle.The facts on your site are also predictions about the future effects of a fuel shortage. Have you read your article? You even say it yourself, 'Here's a link that shows the predicted rate of fossil fuel depletion.' You even add that it is not accurate! Your link: In other words, your arguments have an equal amount of proofs against them. And since you are offering a counterplan, BoP is shared between Pro and Con. I've already shown how global warming is a reality, and you accept that. 'If it does, then its burning and production also cause pollution. Dealing with the fuel crisis will definitely impact global warming (Round 2, Con).' You agree to global warming being a problem caused by our pollution. My plan is to encourage growth of plant life to counteract the effects of CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide. Specificaly, to fertilize the ocean to encourage growth of algae in the ocean. Lead Researcher Prof. Rob Raiswell of Leeds University, part of a research team devoted to combating global warming through algae, states, 'The team will seek to create a massive algae bloom by releasing several tons of iron sulphate into the sea off the coast of the British island of South Georgia. The patch will apparently be large enough to be visible from space (3).' The article also states that 'If successful, the technique could be rolled out across vast swathes of the Great Southern Ocean. Scientists calculate that if the whole 20 million square miles was treated, it could remove up to three and a half Gigatons of C02, equivalent to one eighth of all global annual emissions from fossil fuels (3).' Out of all the possible ways to combat global warming, this seems to be the one that holds up. </t>

But instead if we tackle the source, naturally even with the number of plants we have right now co2 will be gradually reduced and temperatures would recede to normal. Also, eliminating all greenhouse gas will result in an ice age, and they shouldn't be seen as some sort of dirty pollutants. Co2 is a natural gas that has existed for many years on this Earth. Has co2 really increased that much, or is there another reason? And are the readings of 1900's even correct?

    <t>Seeing as you took the liberty to post an argument in round 1, I will as well. Beginning with definitions:Fuel crisis: a great bottleneck (or price rise) in the supply of energy resources to an economy.Global warming: a gradual increase in the overall temperature of the earth's atmosphere generally attributed to the greenhouse effect caused by increased levels of carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and other pollutants.Now, I'll refute your arguments.1) Currently, it would take more time for global warming to become extremely lethal than it would be for the fuel crisis.The fuel crisis will also take a long time to become extremely lethal. I don't see a lot of death when it comes to the fuel crisis. As defined above, this means if there is less supply, and the same demand, prices will rise. Until Mad Max becomes a reality, no one will be killing each other over a gallon of gasoline or a watt of electricity.2) We must work on devising alternative clean and efficient sources of energy rather than JUST planting trees. I agree. We shouldn't be focused on 'JUST planting trees.' Global warming is a way bigger problem than can be solved by planting a few saplings. According to Scientific American, '...A new study, however, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reports that forests' other climatic effects can cancel out their carbon cleaning advantage in some parts of the world. Using a three-dimensional climate model, the research team mimicked full global deforestation and also studied the effects of clear-cutting in different regions of latitude, such as the tropics and boreal zones. Apparently, these natural carbon sinks only do their job effectively in tropical regions; in other areas, they have either no impact or actually contribute to warming the planet. In fact, according to this model, by the year 2100, if all the forests were cut and left to rot, the annual global mean temperature would decrease by more than 0.5 degree Fahrenheit (1).' Trees are not the primary factor when it comes to decreasing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. I could get more into this, but I'll move onto your third point.3) Moreover, dealing with the fuel crisis will reduce global warming as well as vehicles cause pollution.Or will it? Studies done by the EIA (Energy Immision Administration) indicate that cars create approximately 29% of CO2 emissions (2). The rest? Factories, businesses, and other modes of transportation. Vehicles altogether count for only 34.9% of man-made CO2 emmisions (2). Attacking the fuel crisis alone would be to ignore 65.1% of other man-made scorces of CO2!4) Also, some of these links believe global warming may not be true. First off, links don't believe anything. The people who write them do. Secondly, your first link redirects me to an article that tells me, 'Here are the top 5 arguments for and against global warming.' In other words, the article does not affirm or deny global warming. Your second article redirects me to a couple, as the site calls them, 'COMMON MISSCONCEPTIONS ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING.' In response, here is a site on facts about global warming. Your final site redirects me to an article written by the one and only expert on the subject: ElmerB.

It doesn't say which two years are being compared. And even if it is true, just see how much time global warming has before it affects us severely. Temperature increase in different localities are different as well. The facts on this site are mostly predictions about the future effects of global warming, and data from the previous century that could have been moulded due to outliers, such as location and the weather cycle. Some more links (or people) that are against global warming. Anyways, I would say that there is no concrete measurement of the intensity of global warming. Our weather prediction is bad enough as it is, what makes the people believe in global warming all of a sudden? Global warming has been overhyped due to media attention and the media should give more focus to the fuel shortage. Here's a link that shows the predicted rate of fossil fuel depletion. Yes, it may not be accurate, but the fact that fossil fuels take millions of years to form is accepted everywhere, and that once we are out of fuel, we may have no way of getting it back anytime sooner. Worse still, there are oil deposits in the Arctic, and if extraction takes place, it will have a negative effect on global warming. But if the fuel crisis is dealt with, there will be no need to melt the ice. Rather than looking at solving global warming before the fuel problem, we must solve the fuel shortage before global warming. Just look at the time spans. Fuel would run out roughly in a 100 years, global warming would only increase 2 celsius average in a 100 years, if the emissions double from the present.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank beforeifall for accepting this debate.CO2's Effect on TemperatureFirst, correlation. The climate data over the last 700,000 years or so show that temperature and CO2 track very close to each other. '...there is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2. The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv. The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr.'[1]This graph shows the CO2-temperature correlation over the last 650,000 years[2]: CO2 can be the dominant forcing for the climate. Consider the Cenozoic era (the last 65 million years). Overall, solar activity increased 0.4% over this period. 'Because Earth absorbs about 240 W/m^2 of solar energy, that brightness increase is a forcing of about 1 W/m^2. This small linear increase of forcing, by itself, would have caused a modest global warming through the Cenozoic Era.' The CO2 levels caused a much higher forcing. 'In contrast, atmospheric CO2 during the Cenozoic changed from at least 1000 ppm in the early Cenozoic to as small as 170 ppm during recent ice ages. The resulting climate forcing, as can be computed accurately for this CO2 range... exceeds 10 W/m^2. It is clear that CO2 was the dominant climate forcing in the Cenozoic.'[3]But then, there's also the matter of causation. CO2's effect on temperature can be explained by appealing to the carbon cycle. The Earth receives all of its energy from the sun. Some of this is reflected by the Earth's surface and by clouds and other particles present in the atmosphere. In addition, some of the built up energy in the Earth's surface can be emitted back into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases like CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide trap some of this emitted heat by reflecting the radiation back to the surface. However, greater concentrations of greenhouse gases cause more of the energy that is being emitted from the surface to be reflected back to the surface. This causes more heat to build up, warming the planet.[4]Now consider climate sensitivity. Climate sensitivity is the amount the temperature would rise if the CO2 concentration were doubled. Obviously, if there's a large climate sensitivity, then increases in CO2 have large effect. It is known that the climate sensitivity is around 1 degree C. However, this can be amplified through feedbacks. Positive ones amplify the sensitivity, while negative ones diminish the sensitivity. The evidence overwhelmingly comes down on the former, that positive feedbacks are happening. Increases in CO2 cause temperature increases, which are amplified by water vapor and the effect on clouds.'Since the radiative effects associated with the buildup of water vapor to near-saturation levels and the subsequent condensation into clouds are far stronger than the equilibrium level of radiative forcing by the non-condensing GHGs, this results in large local fluctuations in temperature about the global equilibrium value.'[5]This can be shown in the below graph[5]: Now back to the carbon cycle. Global warming can result in the death of vegetation (due to droughts) and the warming of the ocean. Both of these further reduce the maximum absorption of the Earths carbon cycle, thus resulting in even more CO2 being released into the atmosphere. And with this, CO2 increases even more. In other words, CO2-caused temperature increases are amplified by positive feedbacks and the mechanics of the carbon cycle.So, the positive feedback amplifies the climate sensitivity. How much it is amplified can be determined through study. Using a Bayesian statistical approach, which is “the dominant [method] in the literature”, these findings support the notion of climate sensitivity as maximum 4 degrees C, a mean of 3 degrees C, and likely not lower than 3 degrees.[6]The graph below gives a statistical analysis[7]:The mean is around 3 degrees C. The CO2 that humans emit thus has an effect of 3 degrees C per doubling of CO2. This can be shown by the fact that CO2 concentrations have increased from around 275 ppm to around 400 ppm. This is an increase of around 40%. This should manifest itself with a temperature increase of a little less than 1.5 degrees C. Indeed, temperatures have increased around this amount over the last 150 years. The anthropogenic-forcing climate models thus match observations.[8]In other words, in addition to the direct evidence of how the Earth is warming, the climate models based on a greenhouse gas cause to global warming explain almost perfectly the recent global warming. This is a lot of evidence for a human case to the recent global warming.Humans' Emission of CO2It would be rather coincidental if the recent rise in global warming happened to start just around the time that humans started to emit large quantities of greenhouse gases. However, there is direct evidence as well, in addition to the already established correlation between temperature and CO2.Now, it is known that CO2 levels are increasing. 'In pre-industrial times over the last 10,000 years, CO2 was relatively stable at around 275 to 285 parts per million. Over the last 250 years, atmospheric CO2 levels have increased by about 100 parts per million.' CO2 levels are increasing at a level not seen in at least 500,000 years, if not longer.[9]Here is a graph showing CO2 concentrations over the last 10000 years[10][11]:The evidence that this excess CO2 is the cause of the recent global warming is voluminous. One of the biggest indicators is the fact that less heat is escaping into space. Satellites measure less heat escaping out into space, particularly at the specific wavelengths that CO2 absorbs. In other words, the Earth is retaining a greater percentage of the heat that it receives from the sun than it did before. This excess heat manifests itself through global temperature increases. 'If less heat is escaping to space, where is it going? Back to the Earth's surface. Surface measurements confirm this, observing more downward infrared radiation. A closer look at the downward radiation finds more heat returning at CO2 wavelengths, leading to the conclusion that '...this experimental data should effectively end the argument by skeptics that no experimental evidence exists for the connection between greenhouse gas increases in the atmosphere and global warming.''[12][13][14]Another piece of evidence is a comparison of warming in the troposphere and stratosphere. Because the CO2 is in the upper troposphere, the troposphere temperature would increase, while the stratospheric temperature would decrease, because there would be less heat reaching the stratosphere. 'Computer model estimates of the ‘human influence’ fingerprint are broadly similar to the observed pattern. In sharp contrast, model simulations of internal and total natural variability cannot produce the same sustained, large-scale warming of the troposphere and cooling of the stratosphere.'[12][15][16]This graph shows this[15]:Related to this is the fact that the tropopause, the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere, is rising. This is because the temperature gradient between the top of the troposphere and the bottom of the stratosphere is greater, as just described above. This causes the warmer air from the troposphere to rise, pushing the troposphere up. 'Observations indicate that the height of the tropopause - the boundary between the stratosphere and troposphere - has increased by several hundred meters since 1979.'[12][17]Another related piece of evidence to this is the cooling of the ionosphere. The ionosphere is the layer of the Earth's atmosphere where ionization takes place. It comprises the upper mesosphere, thermosphere, and lower exosphere. More precisely, it extends from 60 km to 1000 km above the surface. Studies indicate, '...moderate negative trends of about 2 to 3 K per decade at heights of 50 to 70 km... slightly larger cooling trends at heights of 70 to 80 km in the low and middle latitudes... essentially zero temperature trends between 80 and 100 km... at heights near 350 km, a negative trend of about –17 K per decade.'[12][18]Yet another piece of evidence is the frequency of cold days and nights. Because the sun only shines in the day time, if the sun was causing global warming, the days would warm faster than the nights, while if greenhouse gases were causing global warming, this wouldn't be observed. It is the latter's prediction that is observed. 'What we observe is a decrease in cold nights greater than the decrease in cold days, and an increase in warm nights greater than the increase in warm days.'[12][15][19]This can be shown in the below graph[15]:Overall, the evidence shows that human-emitted greenhouse gases are the main cause of global warming. CO2, in addition to other greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide are being emitted by humans in very large amounts, and this is manifesting itself in an increase in the average global temperature.ConclusionGreenhouse gases cause global warming because of their heat trapping abilities. Humans have been emitting vast amounts of greenhouse gases over the last 150 years, and this shows itself on the CO2 measurements. The atmospheric warming pattern and greater heating at night are evidence that the recent global warming is caused by those human emitted greenhouse gases. These increases are amplified through the water vapor and cloud positive feedbacks and the positive feedback that arises through the climate cycle. The climate sensitivity ends up being around 3 degrees C. Finally, the CO2-temperature record shows that the two correlate with remarkable correlation.SourcesSources in comments.</t>

    <t>Numerous alternate causes to global warming prove that humans are not the primary source. Adopt a mindset of innocent until proven guilty, the affirmative must prove beyond correlation and doubt that human cause warming. The Pro must win that mankind is the 'principal [and] leading' meaning that if I win that there is an alternative cause that is more responsible for warming than humans, or at least humans are not a major cause, then I win the debate. (First Pro speech)As the Con, I may contradict myself as my sole purpose is to disprove the Pro's statement. The Pro must remain consistent to prove their position.First, 1,500 year climate cycles. Fred Singer, an atmospheric and space physicist with a PhD from Princeton who founded the the Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) and Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC), and Dennis Avery, a agricultural analyst who was awarded the National Intelligence Medal of Achievement, agree that there is substantial evidence around the world that climate cycles easily explain the warming we currently see. There is already a scientific consensus that cooling cycles (Ice Ages) exist, so it already not unreasonable to assume that warming cycles also exist. From 1300 to 1850, the Little Ice Age caused the earth to be about 2.5 degrees Celsius cooler than average. The Modern Warming portion of the cycle began in 1850, and 'warming will continue for some time in the future, perhaps 200 years or more, regardless of human activity.' Thus, today's warming can be explained by these climate cycles. These scientists gathered data from North America to Asia, and they use the ice caps in Greenland to further prove that by the way the ice formed, there must have been 1,500 year warming cycles. Sea sediment core in Ireland also shows the 1,500 year cycle. Fossilized pollen, boreholes, tree rings, and mountain tree lines all provide evidence to this theory because scientists can find how they were created or observe differing distances of tree rings to find the amount of warming that these objects underwent while being created. It's important to realize that completely dismissing 1,500 year cycles dismisses 'human histories from the past 2,000 years...and a variety of physical evidence found by a huge body of serious researchers.' (1) The Vostok ice sample that the rise and fall of CO2 correlate with natural cycles. Temperatures correlate with Ice Age minimus and maximus. There is a 420,000 thousand year cycle of carbon emissions. Given that humans release very little of the total carbon ouput, the correlation is between the carbon cycle and temperature cycle. (5)Secondly, human emissions of carbon dioxide are specifically not to blame. Patrick Moore, a former member of Greenpeace and an ecologist said the following while testifying in front of Congress: 'There is no scientific proof that human emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) are the dominant cause of the minor warming of the Earth's atmosphere over the past 100 years.' In fact, carbon dioxide levels were 10x higher during the Ice Ages than they are now. This was also true 500 million years ago before evolution had created humans. Not only does this empiric disprove that humans are a major cause of increased carbon dioxide, but it also disproves that CO2 causing warming. Regardless of the theoretical examples the Pro provides, empirics trump. Third, the industrial revolution began in 1750, yet only from 1910 to 1940, there was an increase in .5 degrees Celsius of the global temperature. There was more than enough time for factories to produce enough carbon dioxide to have resulted in warming before those 200 years. This delay in increase prove that humans are not the main cause and is evidence of the climate cycles. (2) During this time, temperatures were much higher than today, but CO2 levels were lower. This places doubt in the significance of anthropogenic CO2 release. (7)Fourth, the climate rapidly changes to different stimuli. Anthony Lupo, assistant professor of atmospheric science at the University of Missouri at Columbia and an expert reviewer for the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Chang, discusses the fact that regional climates tend to experience much more change than globally. However, climates change rapidly, so if human emissions of CO2 really are responsible for warming, then 1) there should already be a much larger change in global temperature given the huge increase of CO2 emissions and 2) even when there were smaller amounts of CO2, this should have been enough to trigger an environmental change (3).Fifth, climate models fail. There was an increase in global temperature of 0.57C during the 30-year period from 1970 to 2000. Since then there has been no increase, perhaps a slight decrease, in average global temperature. This clearly disproves the numerous computer models that the Pro cites as CO2 had increased after 2000 (2). Many believe that there will be an increase of anywhere from 2-11 degrees Fahrenheit due to info from computer models. Misinterpretation of results and models lacking the complexities of the fundamental global processes mean that these cannot be trusted. Consistently, politicians like Al Gore have predicted that the world would have literally ended by now. Prefer direct facts and empirical examples rather than theoretical results of greenhouse gases. Thus, do not automatically trust that greenhouse gases cause warming without direct evidence from changes in temperature â€' the facts don't support this conclusion. (3) Though the Earth is warming, it's cooler than expected. There should have already been a two degree Celsius increase 100,000 years ago. (5) [Insert pie graph from this source]Sixth, fossil fuels do not cause an increase in CO2 levels according to the most accurate NASA data. From 1940 to 1950, CO2 levels flatlined. The only change was roughly .8 ppm downwards. World War II caused a massive increase in fossil fuel levels, yet this did not change CO2 levels. Prefer empirics. (4) Also, the Vostok ice core sample proves. CO2 increases did not increase temperature for 800 years. This sample also explains why a fall in temperature and a fall in CO2 correlate — cold water can hold more CO2 than warm water. Even more, temperature falls around 800-1,000 years before CO2 levels rise or fall giving water time to absorb the CO2. (5)Seventh, even if humans do increase CO2 levels, they're only responsible for a 3% increase. Even that released CO2 is not all directly released into the atmosphere given that the oceans absorb so much of it. Limestone, chalk, and other rocks have 100x as much CO2 as the atmosphere. This 3% is responsible for .27% of the greenhouse effect. 'If we were to cease all transport and industry right now, it is very unrealistic to assume that it would have any impact on global warming.' (5) Eighth, solar radiation is the single largest cause of warming. NASA repeatedly releases articles explaining the importance of the sun and sun cycles on the Earth. The near infrared and visible light waves are absorbed by the lower atmosphere, the oceans, and the land. Thus, these areas heat resulting in a higher global average temperature. Even more, absorption of UV rays heats the stratosphere. There's a general scientific consensus that this increases temperatures in the troposphere. Additionally, sun spots serve to reduce or increase warming. These can sway warming either way considering that these are 11 year cycles. This can explain why times of higher CO2 did not increase temperature. Scientists believe that the sun is responsible for at least half of all the climate change seen in the past 110 years. Even the IPCC, an organization devoted to creating response to globa warming, agrees. (6)The 100,000 year cycle of radiation resulting from the elliptical orbit of the Earth is at a peak and will be for the next several thousand years. This radiation is consistent with spikes in CO2 methane. The melting of ice caps has happened with each of these cycles. The huge volume of these gases is too high to be anthropogenic but is consistent with previous cycles. Mars is also increasing in temperature due to the recent increase in solar radiation. Dr. H. Abdussamatov, head of the  St. Petersburg Pulkova Astronomical Observatory, believes that the Earth has hit a temperature ceiling and will enter a cooling period despite fossil fuel use. This explanation accounts for the lack of increased greenhouse gas emissions since 1988. (7) [Insert Figure III]ConclusionSolar radiation, solar cycles, and multiple terrestrial temperature cycles are greater and more probable causes of warming. Humans produce very little emissions given the oceans' absorption and solar radiation cycles. The Earth has consistently changed temperatures before humans populated the planet. Even more, multiple empirics and evidence from around the world disprove the importance of humans on warming. 3% is a ridiculously small number when compared to multiple other emittors. CO2 levels were higher in the Ice Age when the Earth was substantially cooler. By placing some amount of doubt in the significance of mankind's importance on warming while promoting several other causes, humans are at least not the main factor of warming.</t>

Most of the data that scientists have found on this has come from the northern hemisphere. However, in the southern hemisphere, the exact opposite trend happens. In other words, whenever the northern hemisphere is warming, the southern hemisphere is cooling, and vice versa. 'Whereas Antarctic and Greenland climate records do exhibit approximate anti-phase behavior around 50% of the time, they are generally in phase during cooling. A phase lead of Southern Hemisphere climate of 1000-1600 years is statistically indistinguishable from a lag of 400-800 years, whether for Dansgaard-Oeschger [1500-year cycles], Heinrich, or longer-duration events. The 'seesaw' or 'Southern lead' appearance of the data arises from the fundamentally different characeristics of the climate series, most importantly the absence of rapid warming events in Antarctica comparable to those in Greenland'.[1]However, in the current case, we see that both the northern and southern hemispheres are warming, meaning that it cannot be due to the 1500-year cycles.[2]Human Emissions of Carbon DioxideThe claim that CO2 levels were higher during certain ice ages is based off of old, faulty data. A recent study found that the levels during the Ordovician era (the era most climate skeptics focus on when making arguments like this) were eight times below pre-Industrial levels. This is indeed still a little high, but it's also important bearing in mind that the sun was dimmer then. During the Ordovician era, the sun was 4% dimmer. This meant that higher CO2 levels would have been necessary for Earth to have not been frozen over. This is based on established nuclear models of main sequence stars. Considering all of this, '...over the long term, there is indeed a correlation between CO2 and paleotemperature'.[3][4][5]Apparent Mismatch Between CO2 and Temperature IncreasesIt is true that the vast majority of the warming happened over the 20th century. However, it is also true that the vast majority of the CO2 emitted into the atmosphere was emitted over the 20th century. See the graph below[6]:It is easy to see that only a small fraction of the emitted CO2 was emitted before 1900, and this correlates with the fact that only a small fraction of the temperature increases occurred before 1900.Amount of CO2 EmissionsAny CO2 emitted into the atmosphere would have an adverse effect on the climate. As I said in the last round, there was a study that said, using a Bayesian statistical approach, the climate sensitivity as maximum 4 degrees C, a mean of 3 degrees C, and likely value of not lower than 3 degrees. This means that the CO2 that humans emit thus has an effect of 3 degrees C per doubling of CO2. This can be shown by the fact that CO2 concentrations have increased from around 275 ppm to around 400 ppm. This is an increase of around 40%. This should manifest itself with a temperature increase of a little less than 1.5 degrees C. This is indeed around the amount of global warming we have seen so far. It should not be more than this.[7][8]If less CO2 had been added into the atmosphere, then the planet would have warmed less, but it still would have warmed. This would be true for any non-zero amount of CO2 emission. Climate ModelsThis point is irrelevant. The climate is much more complicated than just a correlation between CO2 and temperature (even though it still exists). Climate models have to be extraordinarily complicated, and even so, they might leave out very important climate forcings. Even if they didn't, there might still be glitches in the models that would make the model give an invalid result. The ability for climate models to accurately predict the climate is completely independent of the whether or not CO2 levels are related to temperature levelsIt is worth falsifying the notion, however, that there has been no warming since 2000. This idea is based on satellite measurements of atmospheric temperature. However, there are two problems with this. One, while the atmosphere accounts for only less than 3% of increased heat content, the oceans account for the vast majority, and they show no such trend.[9] The graph below shows this[10]: And two, there have been a lot of negative short term forcings over the last 20 years. Removing the short term trends of the extremely powerful El Nino in 1998, volcanic activity, and solar activity, the atmospheric temperature plot looks more smooth[11]:(You can faintly see what the plot looked like before the negative forcings were removed; the variability after 1998 makes any analysis before a statistical reanalysis suspect).Correlation Between CO2 Emissions and CO2 LevelsMany studies have shown that the 'airborne fraction', or the fraction of human CO2 emissions that stay in the atmopshere, is around 43%. The fact that the CO2 levels flatlined during WWII is actually rather complicated. While military activity spiked, other industrial activity plummeted and millions of people died, decreasing the need for non-military CO2 emission even lower. In addition, CO2 levels are not known with the precision necessary to unravel this mystery before 1960, due to improper measuring techniques. There are simply too many factors too consider to make a sound conclusion here.As for the apparent 800-year lag in CO2 levels after temperature increases, this is indeed true. However, this is because there was no non-natural (i.e. human) forcing of CO2. Instead, another forcing initiates the warming trend, and CO2 amplifies it. 'When the Earth comes out of an ice age, the warming is not initiated by CO2 but by changes in the Earth's orbit. The warming causes the oceans to release CO2. The CO2 amplifies the warming and mixes through the atmosphere, spreading warming throughout the planet. So CO2 causes warming and rising temperature causes CO2 rise. Overall, about 90% of the global warming occurs after the CO2 increase.'[12]Human Versus Natural CO2 EmissionNatural CO2 emissions are typically stable, meaning that there is rarely any long term climate change that results from natural emissions of CO2. However, humans have emitted a lot of CO2, above and beyond what is naturally emitted, and this unbalances the climate stability. 'Although our output of 29 gigatons of CO2 is tiny compared to the 750 gigatons moving through the carbon cycle each year, it adds up because the land and ocean cannot absorb all of the extra CO2. About 40% of this additional CO2 is absorbed. The rest remains in the atmosphere.'[13]Solar ActivityThe most important of the natural climate forcings is indeed the sun. It is the source of the Earth's energy. This energy comes from the radiation emitted as a result of fusion reactions at the core of the sun. This radiation is known as the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI). Any change in the TSI causes energy imbalances on the Earth. This energy imbalance can be calculated using the formula below[14]:Delta means change, so Delta(F) means the change in energy (i.e. energy imbalance) and Delta(TSI) means the change in solar irradiance. The 0.7 factor comes from the fact that the Earth reflects about 30% of the solar radiation it receives, and the 1/4 factor comes from spherical geometry.Changes in temperature are proportional to the energy imbalance. This can be expressed in the formula below[14]:Lambda is the constant of proportionality, representing the climate sensitivity (discussed in my first argument) in this case.The only thing that's left is to actually determine the values. First, the change in TSI (in this case, between 1900 and 1950). '...we'll estimate the change in TSI at 0.5 to 2 W-m-2.' This corresponds to an energy imbalance of around 0.1-0.35 W-m-2. Next, the lambda factor. I explained in the last article that the statistically most probable value for the climate sensitivity was around 3 degrees C. But, there was a lot of variation. 'Studies have given a possible range of values of 2 to 4.5°C warming for a doubling of CO2, which corresponds to a range of 0.54 to 1.2°C/(W-m-2) for λ.' This gives range of values from 0.05 to 0.4 degrees C, with a most probable value of 0.15 degrees C (corresponding to the statistically most likely climate sensitivity). In other words, solar activity from 1900 to 1950 raised the temperature of the Earth 0.15 degrees C. Looking at the effect of CO2 emissions over that same period, humans increased the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere by about 20 parts per million, giving a range of values of 0.14-0.32 degrees C for the effect of that emission on the climate, with the most probable being 0.22 degrees C.[14][15]This corresponds to CO2 amounting for 60% of the warming from 1900-1950. After that, it gets higher. CO2 emissions rise exponentally, and changes in the TSI start getting less positive, and eventually become negative after 1975. 'Over the past century, this increase in TSI is responsible for about 15-20% of global warming. But since TSI hasn't increased in at least the past 32 years (and more like 60 years, based on reconstructions), the Sun is not directly responsible for the warming over that period.' Solar activity cannot account for the warming after 1975, and even before that was a smaller factor than CO2.[14][15]This can be shown in the image below[16]:Therefore, we see CO2 correlates with recent temperature increases better than solar activity, especially after 1975.Long Term Forcings and MarsThe cycle of radiation is so long that it would not be having the sudden, enormous effect we've seen over the last 150 years. As for Mars, the studies concluded that it was a change in the surface dust, not solar activity, that caused the warming. Surface dust has a massive effect on Mars's climate. The supposed warming trend went from before the surface dust change to after it. Therefore, Mars did not warm because of solar activity.[17][18]SourcesSources in comments.</h>

One, while the atmosphere accounts for only less than 3% of increased heat content, the oceans account for the vast majority, and they show no such trend.[9] The graph below shows this[10]: And two, there have been a lot of negative short term forcings over the last 20 years. Removing the short term trends of the extremely powerful El Nino in 1998, volcanic activity, and solar activity, the atmospheric temperature plot looks more smooth[11]:(You can faintly see what the plot looked like before the negative forcings were removed; the variability after 1998 makes any analysis before a statistical reanalysis suspect).Correlation Between CO2 Emissions and CO2 LevelsMany studies have shown that the 'airborne fraction', or the fraction of human CO2 emissions that stay in the atmopshere, is around 43%. The fact that the CO2 levels flatlined during WWII is actually rather complicated. While military activity spiked, other industrial activity plummeted and millions of people died, decreasing the need for non-military CO2 emission even lower. In addition, CO2 levels are not known with the precision necessary to unravel this mystery before 1960, due to improper measuring techniques. There are simply too many factors too consider to make a sound conclusion here.As for the apparent 800-year lag in CO2 levels after temperature increases, this is indeed true. However, this is because there was no non-natural (i.e. human) forcing of CO2. Instead, another forcing initiates the warming trend, and CO2 amplifies it. 'When the Earth comes out of an ice age, the warming is not initiated by CO2 but by changes in the Earth's orbit. The warming causes the oceans to release CO2. The CO2 amplifies the warming and mixes through the atmosphere, spreading warming throughout the planet. So CO2 causes warming and rising temperature causes CO2 rise. Overall, about 90% of the global warming occurs after the CO2 increase.'[12]Human Versus Natural CO2 EmissionNatural CO2 emissions are typically stable, meaning that there is rarely any long term climate change that results from natural emissions of CO2. However, humans have emitted a lot of CO2, above and beyond what is naturally emitted, and this unbalances the climate stability. 'Although our output of 29 gigatons of CO2 is tiny compared to the 750 gigatons moving through the carbon cycle each year, it adds up because the land and ocean cannot absorb all of the extra CO2. About 40% of this additional CO2 is absorbed. The rest remains in the atmosphere.'[13]Solar ActivityThe most important of the natural climate forcings is indeed the sun. It is the source of the Earth's energy. This energy comes from the radiation emitted as a result of fusion reactions at the core of the sun. This radiation is known as the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI). Any change in the TSI causes energy imbalances on the Earth. This energy imbalance can be calculated using the formula below[14]:Delta means change, so Delta(F) means the change in energy (i.e. energy imbalance) and Delta(TSI) means the change in solar irradiance. The 0.7 factor comes from the fact that the Earth reflects about 30% of the solar radiation it receives, and the 1/4 factor comes from spherical geometry.Changes in temperature are proportional to the energy imbalance. This can be expressed in the formula below[14]:Lambda is the constant of proportionality, representing the climate sensitivity (discussed in my first argument) in this case.The only thing that's left is to actually determine the values. First, the change in TSI (in this case, between 1900 and 1950). '...we'll estimate the change in TSI at 0.5 to 2 W-m-2.' This corresponds to an energy imbalance of around 0.1-0.35 W-m-2. Next, the lambda factor. I explained in the last article that the statistically most probable value for the climate sensitivity was around 3 degrees C. But, there was a lot of variation. 'Studies have given a possible range of values of 2 to 4.5°C warming for a doubling of CO2, which corresponds to a range of 0.54 to 1.2°C/(W-m-2) for λ.' This gives range of values from 0.05 to 0.4 degrees C, with a most probable value of 0.15 degrees C (corresponding to the statistically most likely climate sensitivity). In other words, solar activity from 1900 to 1950 raised the temperature of the Earth 0.15 degrees C. Looking at the effect of CO2 emissions over that same period, humans increased the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere by about 20 parts per million, giving a range of values of 0.14-0.32 degrees C for the effect of that emission on the climate, with the most probable being 0.22 degrees C.[14][15]This corresponds to CO2 amounting for 60% of the warming from 1900-1950. After that, it gets higher. CO2 emissions rise exponentally, and changes in the TSI start getting less positive, and eventually become negative after 1975. 'Over the past century, this increase in TSI is responsible for about 15-20% of global warming. But since TSI hasn't increased in at least the past 32 years (and more like 60 years, based on reconstructions), the Sun is not directly responsible for the warming over that period.' Solar activity cannot account for the warming after 1975, and even before that was a smaller factor than CO2.[14][15]This can be shown in the image below[16]:Therefore, we see CO2 correlates with recent temperature increases better than solar activity, especially after 1975.Long Term Forcings and MarsThe cycle of radiation is so long that it would not be having the sudden, enormous effect we've seen over the last 150 years. As for Mars, the studies concluded that it was a change in the surface dust, not solar activity, that caused the warming. Surface dust has a massive effect on Mars's climate. The supposed warming trend went from before the surface dust change to after it. Therefore, Mars did not warm because of solar activity.[17][18]SourcesSources in comments.</t>

    <t>It seems to be difficult to get someone to debate me on this topic. Hopefully my opponent will at least respond to my original arguments.</t>
<h>Thank you for the chance to debate this topic. I am an avid believer that climate change is mainly man made, at least now.  Your first point was how even though data shows a correlation between CO2 emissions and temperature, carbon emission is not the largest factor. But according to the World Meteorological Organization (as well as NASA and countless organizations and scientists), CO2 is the largest factor of global warming. This study included natural substances like water vapor. The problem with CO2 is that it is a very abundant greenhouse gas which takes a long time to dissipate from the atmosphere. 65% of global emissions are CO2 emissions, making it by far the most abundant man made greenhouse gas. Even though it isn't as abundant as water vapor, it is much more effective at trapping the Sun's rays. Now, greenhouse gases are the largest cause of global warming, while the most effective and very abundant greenhouse gas is CO2. Here are some graphs:  From NASA, this is probably the most infamous graph as it shows just how drastic CO2 emissions have gone up.  (It won't let me post photos, so here is the link) http://climate.nasa.gov...  Enlightening, isn't it?  Now this concerns temperature rise at the same time as CO2 rise.  http://climate.nasa.gov...  This link should have the graph close to the top on the right hand side Not only that, but a massive 97% of all scientists agree global warming is man made. ------- Your second point was that temperatures were higher in the past than they are now (specifically, during the time of Roman civilization). While there definitely are natural cycles that rise and lower, Earth's temperature is accelerating at a much faster rate than any natural cycle before, and shows no sign of stopping like a cycle would. This is again, because of man made emissions, and the majority of those are carbon. ------- Your third point was that global warming is mainly due to sun rays hitting the earth and heating it up. While sun rays hit the earth and that is what causes all weather, the amount of rays stays basically stable like the earths orbit. So when greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere, they trap sun rays and warm the earth.  So the evidence shows clearly that global warming is mainly people driven, although natural cycles may contribute to the increase. The evidence shows clearly that greenhouse gases are the largest cause of global warming. The evidence shows clearly that CO2 is the largest greenhouse gas threat. Therefore, the evidence shows that CO2 is the main cause of global warming. </h>

    <t>The Macquarie Dictionary defines the term 'climate change' as- a significant change in the usual climatic conditions especially that thought to be caused by global warming. This 'climate change' can be caused by natural or human induced impacts.  The global average temperature has risen by nearly a degree in the past 50 years. Scientists around the world have been recording temperature increases, raised ocean levels and melting of ice caps. All this is evidence that the earth is experiencing a 'climate change'.  Many people believe that this change is primarily due to the fact that our CO2 emissions have created more greenhouse gases. They believe that there is a relationship between the rise in temperatures and the rise in CO2 emissions.  Data shows an 'association' between temperature levels and CO2 emissions but does not necessarily prove that increased CO2 levels are the most significant aspect of today's climate change.  For something complex like the weather system, many scientists are needed to unravel the story behind climate change. While most scientists believe climate change occurs, not all agree on the extent and relevance of human activity as an influence on climate change.  While major international climate agencies all emphasise the critical role of CO2 emissions in climate change, others are not so sure.  For example, some scientists have conducted research that suggests that temperatures were higher than they are today, during the Roman and Medieval periods. These ancient civilisations would not have emitted CO2 emissions as we do today, so why did their temperatures rise?  Temperatures have risen and fallen for a long time. The National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) states that climate change over the longer term is mainly due to the amount of sun energy hitting the Earth. Slight changes in the Earth's orbit and changes in sun ray intensity, can alter the temperatures here on Earth.  Even so, most scientists still emphasise the role of CO2 emissions in unprecedented, rapid global warming. The frank fact is that climate change cannot be stopped. It is completely natural.</t>

    <t>Before I begin I would like to initially reinforce the topic of the debate: CO2 emissions are DIRECTLY responsible for climate change. As the negative, I will rebut the affirmative as to why CO2 emissions (whilst adding to the heat of the planet) are not directly responsible for the changes we are experiencing on our Earth today.  The affirmative stated statistics such as- 'CO2 is the largest factor of global warming', '97% of scientists agree global warming is man-made', 'CO2 is the largest greenhouse gas threat'. Whilst these points may be tried and tested, they do not favour the topic when the phrase 'directly responsible' is included.  From what I gather, the affirmative believes that CO2 is speeding up the process of global warming. Whilst this may be true, in between the lines of this statement we can discover that another factor is actually CAUSING the process of global warming. As the negative, I believe that the cause is the fluctuation of the Earth's orbit (which the affirmative incorrectly stated as 'stable') and the consistent rise and fall of the planet's historical temperatures.  I stand by the points I raised in the first round and have now refuted the rebuttal put forward by the affirmative and regarded it as invalid. Does the affirmative have anything within it's case to state why my reason for global warming is incorrect? Do they believe that CO2 emissions are the initial cause of the Earth heating world-wide? By now, they should surely agree that CO2 emission are not directly responsible for climate change.</t>

    <t>To conclude my case I would like to point out the obvious flaws in the opposition's previous case. They stated:  'Before I make my points, I would like to address the mistaken Negative. I do know that the topic is 'CO2 is the largest factor in global warming', and that is what I am arguing. I'm sorry if that wasn't made clear in my evidence, but if you look back you will find that I certainly did argue that point. Your evidence was arguing against CO2 being the largest factor, and as your opponent that is what I must counter. Now that it's out of the way, let's begin.'  Once again I correct the affirmative on the correct wording of the topic. The topic of this debate is that CO2 emissions are directly responsible for climate change. Throughout their entire case the affirmative seems to be referring to their fictional topic of: CO2 is the largest factor in global warming.  The affirmative also stated that my evidence was backing this fictional topic. Whilst this may be true, proving that CO2 emissions are not the largest factor of global warming only adds to the overall proof that they are not directly responsible for the effects.  To clear confusion, the definition of directly responsible is: without anyone or anything intervening. Whilst the affirmative continued to provide arguments proving the existence of CO2 emissions as the largest factor, they did not provide any points stating the absence of an intervention.  There are many examples of other processes in our natural world that are speeding up the global warming. Some of these include methane emissions from cattle, deforestation and chemical fertilisers on crop lands. Although the affirmative believes that CO2 emissions play the largest role in heating the planet, they are not the sole reason behind the issue.  If the impossible event of a CO2 emission cease occurred, the Earth would still be heating up. Slowly but surely, the effects of the Earth's orbit and the causes mentioned above will continue to heat the planet that we live on today.  The affirmative also stated: 'the effects of the Suns rays on earth are increasing.'  In theory, this phrase mentions the effects on sun rays on Earth. Incredulously, even these sun rays play a role in global warming and further diminish the affirmatives picture of CO2 emissions being directly responsible.  In a surprising twist to the debate, the affirmative suddenly seems to understand the topic of the debate towards the end of their case and produces the statement below. Unfortunately, it is also flawed.  'CO2 was the initial cause of global warming, and this is shown in hundreds of studies and tests since that show the before and after the industrial revolution. The fact is, today CO2 is the largest factor and the cause, and I have all the sources to support it.'  Cold hard evidence against the point brought up by the affirmative can be found in my first argument. Global warming is simply defined as increasing temperatures on our planet. Carbon dating and a myriad of other scientific tests show the heating and cooling of the planet well before the involvement of the Industrial Revolution. If the planet was heating up during Medieval periods, how can the affirmative say that CO2 is the cause of global warming when the people of the past had not even heard of the word carbon?  In finality, I am not denying the fact that global warming exists. I am not denying that CO2 emissions play a considerable role in the heating of our planet. However, I do deny the views of the affirmative in thinking the CO2 emissions play a sole role in global warming. There are many other factors that are also contributing to the heating of our planet.  In further expansion, I deny the politicians and organisational leaders within our world. The planet is heating up and it is effecting ecosystems and environments alike. Whilst we sit here and debate whether CO2 emissions are directly responsible, politicians all over the globe are doing the same. It is time to stop the debate and face the fact that although CO2 emissions have played a big role in global warming, the gradual heating of our planet is totally inevitable.  As an international force we need to combat global warming and thus climate change by investigating new methods of adapting to a changing climate. Cooling down the Earth by reducing CO2 emissions is a false statement because the Earth will continue to heat via its natural cycles which we as humans would be wrong to alter.  As the negative side, I strongly believe that CO2 emissions are not directly responsible for climate change. Thank you.</t>

    <t>Before I make my points, I would like to address the mistaken Negative. I do know that the topic is 'CO2 is the largest factor in global warming', and that is what I am arguing. I'm sorry if that wasn't made clear in my evidence, but if you look back you will find that I certainly did argue that point. Your evidence was arguing against CO2 being the largest factor, and as your opponent that is what I must counter. Now that it's out of the way, let's begin.  Negative thinks I only believe CO2 is speeding up the process of climate change. It most definitely is, and they are not mistaken in that. But not only is it speeding up and forcing climate change to continue, it is the main factor in this.  No matter what my opponent may think, my evidence clearly showed CO2 is the largest threat. Greenhouse gases are proven to be the largest contributor to global warming, and CO2 is the largest greenhouse gas. And according to the World Meteorological Organization, the US Environmental Protection Agency, NASA, the European Commission and thousands of scientists, CO2 is the largest factor.  Negative may say that fluctuations in the earths orbit are the largest cause. To say that fluctuations in earths orbit are the largest cause is a bold statement. I think that by orbit fluctuations, he means that it causes Suns rays to hit the earth more. But according to NASA, solar maxima is only .1 percent higher than solar minima on average.  To further my counter argument, if there had been an increase in solar output, both the stratosphere and troposphere would have warmed up. But instead, patterns show that the stratosphere has actually cooled. Meanwhile, land and the troposphere have been warming, which is no doubt due to greenhouse gases (particularly CO2). This shows that fluctuations in earths orbit, although drastically climate changing when they occur, are not occurring right now.  However, the effects of the Suns rays on earth are increasing. Not because of orbit fluctuation, but because of greenhouse gases that trap the Suns heat.  CO2 is directly responsible for global warming today. In the earlier graph, I showed how carbon emissions have increased drastically since the industrial revolution. I then linked a graph that showed temperature increase over the same time period. The fact is, since the industrial revolution, temperatures have drastically increased at a rate that would never have occurred without coal burning and that whole era. So CO2 emission IS directly responsible for global warming.  The negative, in their conclusion, called my points invalid. I say the exact opposite. I stand by my points, and the facts that went with it. I most surely do not agree that their case is correct. I have just shown why their case is completely wrong. CO2 was the initial cause of global warming, and this is shown in hundreds of studies and tests since that show the before and after the industrial revolution. The fact is, today CO2 is the largest factor and the cause, and I have all the sources to support it. And sources I cited earlier.</t>

    <t>Sorry for the overuse of qoutes brevity and late timing. I have an unexpected on demand essay to finish by midnight.1. One of your main arguments against zoo/aquariums is that most are for-profit and basically roadside attractions. I obviously recognize that many of these side zoos/aquariums practice animal cruelty, which is definetley illegal. However, you can't deny an institution that has the ability to conserve, educate and protect animals because others exploit the system. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of zoos/aquariums have properly accredited under organizations such as the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums, the Zoological Association of America,etc, and who serve millions of people, not just towns, childrens birthday parties. Work should be done to encourage improvement, not discourage zoos because their are exploitations.2. It is impossible to measure the certain magnitude of which people learn when visiting a zoo. This is because some of the public may visit for purely entertaimment, many students and adults paticipate in wide varities of learning acitvities. Saint Louis is a prime example:'At the Saint Louis Zoo, about 400,000 children and adults participate in our formal programs, including classes and Camp KangaZoo each year. And of our 3,000,000 visitors annually, about 1,900,000 interact with an educational interpreter, docent or zookeeper who provides educational experiences and information. Each year the Zoo is visited by over 1,400 school groups who come for a free field trip. Of these schoolchildren, 31% are from economically disadvantaged neighborhoods, and 17% are special needs children.'[1] Zoos have a uniqe ability to educate the public, with over 600 million visitors a year.  'The chance to see real animals close up can evoke an emotional response, allowing people to attach values to animals, making them aware of the biodiversity crisis, as well as teaching and motivating people (Ballantyne and Packer, 2005; Gwyne, 2007; Fa, Funk and O’Connell, 2011; Rabb and Saunders, 2005). Within this mission, zoos provide an experience which is also recreational but which can inspire cognitive learning, long-term positive attitudes and behaviour change (Broad and Weiler, 1998). provides an opportunity for families to learn in a more relaxed environment, often limited elsewhere (Briseno, Anderson and Anderson, 2007)'. Some authors believe that education is more challenging when distracted by entertainment. However studies have shown that many students tend to learn in positive and active enviroments such as zoos.3 Zoos are actually vital to conservation of animals.'A species protected in captivity provides a reservoir population against a population crash or extinction in the wild. Here they are relatively safe and can be bred up to provide foundation populations. A good number of species only exist in captivity and still more only exist in the wild because they have been reintroduced from zoos, or the wild populations have been boosted by captive bred animals. Quite simply without these efforts there would be fewer species alive today and ecosystems and the world as a whole would be poorer for it. Although reintroduction successes are few and far between, the numbers are increasing and the very fact that species have been saved or reintroduced as a result of captive breeding shows their value. Even apparently non-threatened species and entire groups can be threatened suddenly (as seen with white nose syndrome in bats and the Chytridiomycosisfungus in amphibians) it’s not just pandas and rhinos that are under threat.'</t>

    <t>Zoos are are valuable for public education, awareness, and scientific research. Zoos allow humans to connect and learn about animals through a personal level.F or an example to outline the good of zoos, I will be using the Saint Louis Zoo as well as other institutions.1. Many children, as well as adults, visit zoos through field trips formal classes, workshops, tours, outreach programs, camps, lectures etc. To understand this impact lets look at the The Saint Louis zoo:'At the Saint Louis Zoo, about 400,000 children and adults participate in our formal programs, including classes and Camp KangaZoo each year. And of our 3,000,000 visitors annually, about 1,900,000 interact with an educational interpreter, docent or zookeeper who provides educational experiences and information. Each year the Zoo is visited by over 1,400 school groups who come for a free field trip. Of these schoolchildren, 31% are from economically disadvantaged neighborhoods, and 17% are special needs children.'[1]Zoos can also provide an education far beyond the confines of a classroom, since it allows children (and adults) to be physically awed and inspired by many magnificent creatures. Not only is the learning in the outside world and active, but it gives students greater appreciation of the natural world.[2]2. The rates of animal extinction and endangernment through human acticity grows increasingly alarming everyday. This is a mostly undisputed fact. According to the Center for Bilogical Diversity:'Although extinction is a natural phenomenon, it occurs at a natural “background” rate of about one to five species per year. Scientists estimate we’re now losing species at 1,000 to 10,000 times the background rate, with literally dozens going extinct every day,with as many as 30 to 50 percent of all species possibly heading toward extinction by mid-century n fact, 99 percent of currently threatened species are at risk from human activities, primarily those driving habitat loss, introduction of exotic species, and global warming.'Zoos can slow the rate of extinction because it allows researchers to analyze the behaviors of animals in their enviroments without expensive expeditions into the wild. This information is valuable to park rangers, nature documentaries, field researchers etc. because of increased understanding on  behavior, reproductive biology, nutrition, animal health and genetics.[4]3. Zoos around the world are leaders in encouraging the safety and protection of animals and wildlife. Man zoos set up insituitons and fundations that work throughout the world to save wild life, beyond just the valuable research they provide. For example, the Saint Louis Zoo 'has set up the WildCare Institute to work in conservation hotspots locally and around the globe.' 4. Of course incidents occur in any facility and intitution, but zoos have taken strides to increase human and wildlife safety.'Particularly, those facilities and the individuals employed by them that aspire to the ideals, ethics and ever-increasing standards of animal care and behavioral training represented by organizations such as the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums, the Zoological Association of America, the International Marine Animal Trainers’ Association, and the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, to name a few.'

    <t>I admit the zoos aren't the ideal situation for animals. Some may be kept in cruel and unfortunate cages and concrete slabs. One of your main arguments are that since some animals are mistreated and suffer from mental illness, animals should not be kept in zoos. This disregards not only the potential of zoos to raise awareness, engage the public, increase research, and conserve species, but the strides that many credited, and the most popular and visited, zoos have made. These facilities have teams of experts who analyze the mental state of the animals, massive facilities that are perfectly adequate for animals to roam, and can use these efforts to conserve species world wide. These zoos conform to the AZA standards that enforce strict animal safety. It is true that only 12% of zoos contribute/registered directly to conservation, but many zoos cannot afford to pay for such programs. Instead, the zoos engage the public in learning and interacting with animals on a physical, if not personal, level, which in turn raises appreciation of animals and the therefore an increased effort towards conservation. In the zoos that can afford to be involved in conservation programs, progress has been notable:'Most zoos are not only great places to get up close to wildlife, but many are also doing their part to bolster dwindling populations of animals still living free in the wild. To wit, dozens of zoos across North America participate in the Association of Zoos and Aquarium’s (AZA’s) Species Survival Plan (SSP) Program, which aims to manage the breeding of specific endangered species in order to help maintain healthy and self-sustaining populations that are both genetically diverse and demographically stable. The end goal of many SSPs is the reintroduction of captive-raised endangered species into their native wild habitats. According to the AZA, SSPs and related programs have helped bring black-footed ferrets, California condors, red wolves and several other endangered species back from the brink of extinction over the last three decades. Zoos also use SSPs as research tools to better understand wildlife biology and population dynamics, and to raise awareness and funds to support field projects and habitat protection for specific species. AZA now administers some 113 different SSPs covering 181 individual species.'[1]There is no doubt that zoos can and do provide valuable researchs and insights into animals, inspire the public to learn about and care for animals, and ensure the survival of species. And the number of zoos that do this grow incresingly everyday. Why do we discourage zoos when the have this potential and the safety and understanding of animals increase everyday? To put this in perspective, I'll detail I quick scenario that happens in the world today. China is the world's leading producer of rare earth metals, with an estimate  of 90% of world production, and enforce a strict monopoly. Now, American mining companies have started up with rare earth metals. Some of the mines were shut down for safety/enviromental reasons. However, some mines maintain safe circumstances and are actually more efficient than some Chinese facilities through progress and are slowly but surely lessening the monpoloy. The question is, do we abandon the mines because many mines fail without the proper circumstances, or invest in what can and is beneficial to further increase its abilities to progress and avoid the shut down of an industry?[2] </t>

    <t>In a British study, 59% of children at the zoo had no positive educational outcomes at a zoo. That number rose to 66% without a guide. In another study, 62% of children had no positive outcome or a negative outcome. One of the researchers for the British study said: 'In many cases, a trip to the zoo had a negative impact on the children's understanding of animals and habitats.' Showing children animals in zoos simply teaches them that animals are ours to control. It sets a very bad example. Think of the last time you went to the zoo. Don't lie. You probably didn't learn very much. Sure, you may have read some of the plaques, but more likely you just considered the animals as entertainment. You may have laughed as the otters or seals swam in endless circles in there small pools, or gotten excited when the lion finally paced past the glass where you are standing. But you also may have rolled your eyes and walked right by the bear exhibit when you saw that the polar bears were sleeping (booooring, right?) But you may not have realized that they were sleeping because their body is not meant for the hot climate where you may live.  People can get a lot more educated by simply watching a nature documentary. In this they will see the animals acting normally, and they will see them in their natural habitat. When you see an animal in a zoo you are not seeing them as they would be in the wild. You are seeing a miserable institutionalized animal that is being exploited for entertainment.  As I said before, only 12% of zoos are registered for captive breeding or wildlife conservation. One activist pointed out that 'Wild animal parks and zoos almost always favor large and charismatic animals.' The fact remains that most animals in zoos are not endangered.  Some examples include: Kangaroos, llamas, ostriches, capybaras, emus, black bears, moose, deer, beluga whales, lions, and giraffes. And if we are specifically talking about Seaworld, well, there is no data on whether or not orcas are endangered. So they cannot use that as an excuse.  Human activities that cause pollution, climate change, and the destruction of habitats are not helped by the captive breeding programs, although these problems threaten more than 7000 species. There is no point breeding animals in captivity when one, they cannot be released into the wild because of behavioral issues since they were born in captivity, and two, they have no habitats to go back to. We need to end animal prisons and start raising awareness for the habitat loss that kills millions of animals.  If zoos wanted to encourage the safety of wildlife, they should leave them in the wild where they are happy. Mental health is just as important as physical health.  'zoos have taken strides to increase human and wildlife safety.'  This supports nothing. Strides means nothing to the animals currently suffering in zoos. Up to 10,000 animals are killed for no reason in European zoos. That does not sound like wildlife safety to me.  And people can talk about education, conservation, and awareness, but the fact is that most zoos are not well respected institutions. They are roadside zoos or entertainment hubs that are NOT non-profit and strive to exploit these animals for their 'cuteness'. It is cruel and inhumane.

    <t>Every time you go to the zoo, you can see how much people are learning. As the spend a few seconds at each exhibit and often taunt the animals for entertainment. Of course, some people do not do this. But that doesn't make it any better. The fact remains, that no matter what zoos do in education or conservation (although they do not do much) they are torture for animals. For example, let's think about elephants. Elephants walk up to 30 miles a day in the wild. It is simply impossible to replicate their habitat in a zoo setting. And it is not natural or safe for them to be in zoos. Zoo animals show the public exactly how they are mentally tortured. You can see it in the way monkeys at zoos sway back and forth (zoochosis) or the way the lion or tiger paces for hours on end. You can see it in the collapsed fins and worn down teeth of the animals at Seaworld. It is simply /not ethical/ to do this to animals. And while a tree frog might not mind living in a zoo, you can bet a tiger hates every second. And let's not forget the endless visitors, camera flashes, and screaming children. It is no way to live.  And let's not forget that even in the best zoos, animals do not live happy enriched lives. They live slightly better lives than the ones in roadside zoos. But not by much.  I have fond memories of zoos, most people do. I remember when I was in a zoo camp and they let me make a salad for the giant tortoise and I got to go into the enclosure with these huge creatures. That was amazing. But I also remember crying as my parents took me to visit the tiger because it was just pacing. Back and forth, all day long. It broke my heart.  And as for conservation, you said it yourself. Few species are successfully reintroduced. And yes, animals can 'become threatened' but that is definitely not a valid reason to keep them caged up. Giraffes shouldn't be held in small cages because there is a small chance they might become endangered. It is, well, crazy! And let's not forget my other statistic I said, only 12% of zoos are actually registered for conservation.  'is it ethical for animals to suffer for the 'good' of their species?'  Well, would you stay locked in a small cage for the good of the human race? I doubt it.</t>

    <t>Zoos claim to be good for many things, but they do more harm than good overall. Many of the things zoos claim to do could be done better in different ways without caging animals up.  1. They do not educate people well, despite what they claim. Most people just look at the animals in zoos as entertainment.  2. Very few of the animals in zoos are actually endangered. And even less of those endangered animals are actually helped by those programs. Only 12% of all the zoos in the world are actually registered for captive breeding or wildlife conservation.  3. Zoos are dangerous for animals and humans. Many animals in zoos present with forms of depression and psychosis. They also display self mutilation such as the orcas at seaworld gnawing at the side of their pool and wearing their teeth down to nubs. Most of the zoos in the world are not prestigious institutions, they are roadside zoos or entertainment hubs that only care about using the animals for their personal gain. This awful behavior is displayed in books like 'The One and Only Ivan.'</t>

<h>I understand the argument.  First, 2050 is a projection given by Bill Gates for zero emissions throughout the whole world IF serious and drastic changes are made in reducing of C02 levels. It's not that they wouldn't take effect until 2050 but rather that humans have to work very hard to reach that point by 2050. I did not mean to attack that specific part of the argument but I just wanted to make that clear.  Now, with that being said, this ties into my argument which is that global warming is a greater issue than poverty.  That is, global warming is effecting us now, as I have said before. Drastic changes are already being made right now in order to make an attempt at reaching that goal of Zero C02 emissions by 2050. So, I must make it clear that climate change is a problem that is effecting all humans, right her and now.  Some current effects of climate change are... -Increased coastal flooding and sea level rise. -More damaging wildfires. -More severe droughts. -More severe deforestation. -More severe health risks to humans by pollution. ...Just to name a few http://www.ucsusa.org... -This website run by the Union of Concerned Scientists evaluates the situation properly.  So, as far as the immediacy of this issue I would argue that is is more so than poverty because it effects everyone one on Earth and mostly because it takes LONGER to fix.  Poverty is an immediate issue currently effecting many people but climate change is also immediate and will take much longer to resolve.  Finally, I would also like to state that the solutions for climate change coincide with the solutions for poverty. Just as an example, the Tesla Power Wall allows consumers to store energy that is collected by solar panels, and use it anytime they want. This will prove to be extremely useful for underdeveloped areas which are not anywhere near a power grid.  In reference to that statement, I argue that solving the climate change issue first would be more beneficial to the human race than attempting the vice-versa option which you are arguing. While I agree that educating people will lead to the reduction of global climate change, I think that by the time every underdeveloped country catches up in education, it will be too late for the earth.  With that, I do believe that global climate change is a greater issue than poverty, and that focusing attention on that would be better for the human race.</h>

    <t>Firstly I would like to apologize to my opponent for missing the last round. it was not my intention to miss the debate, simply the fact that time river and my studies in school demand much of its water.  Now on to my argument  Climate change is an issue. It is definitely going to have major consequences on us in the future if we don't do anything. However, Poverty, education, and hunger are all immediate issues. People are suffering right now and dying right now because of it.  I believe that by declaring war on poverty, lack of knowledge, and hunger, the consequences given by climate change will be much reduced if not completely removed  Firstly, People who are educated poorly practice bad habits that could be avoided if they were properly educated. for example, the practices of mass chopping of trees, excessive fishing, and actions that produce emissions are performed by those who do not know the full extent of what can be caused in the future if they do not change their ways.  Also, educating more people puts more minds to work on solutions to the issues at hand. By putting more effort into allowing people in poverty to obtain the financial recourses to obtain an education, more people will be at work armed with knowledge to help combat climate change.  Which leads me to my next point; poverty. Poverty can be defined as 'a financial state in which one is not able obtain the basic necessities such as food, water, clothing, etc.'. As in your earlier statement, the issues from climate change is a long term issue with plans that don't take effect until 2050, while poverty is causing people to suffer right now. By lessening poverty, we reduce crime rates, increase overall happiness, and make the country more progressive in every way such as services and infrastructure. More jobs, and the economy will roll, allowing people to buy more things, and once again, improve technology.  As for convincing me as a debater, You would have to prove to me that Climate change is a more immediate problem, and that solving it would create more of an overall benefit for the human race  Once again im sorry for not being present for the previous round and i will do my best to be present for the final round</t>

    <t>I thank my opponent for this opportunity. I will be arguing against the statement that 'Global Poverty, Education, and hunger are greater issues than global climate change.' I will begin by defining my terms and clarifying my argument:  Poverty: The state or condition of having little or no money, goods, or means of support; condition of being poor.  Education: The act or process of imparting or acquiring general knowledge, developing the powers of reasoning and judgment, and generally of preparing oneself or others intellectually for mature life.  Hunger :A compelling need or desire for food.  Greater: Unusually or comparatively large in size or dimensions.  Issue: A point in question or a matter that is in dispute, as between contending parties in an action at law.  Climate change: A long-term change in the earth's climate, especially a change due to an increase in the average atmospheric temperature.  All definitions were directly quoted from Dictionary.com. The context of all key terms and words should be understood otherwise I will further elaborate.  When the instigator refers to the issue of education I am assuming that they are talking about the lack of free education in specific countries. Also, I assume that hunger is an Issue that is attached to poverty as a result. With that being said, I understand that lack of education and hunger are typically effects that are caused by poverty.  I am arguing against this claim because I do not believe that it is true. I do believe that poverty is a serious issue. I do believe that every country should allow free education through the 12 grade. I also believe that hunger and death from malnutrition are Important issues.  But, I argue that none of these three issues are as important as Climate change. Here's why: Poverty, and the issues surrounding it such as hunger and education effect a select few. Climate change effects every single person living on Earth and every single person who ever will live on Earth.  That is my argument, I look forward to this debate.</t>

That is, what can I do, as a debater, to change your mind and make you believe me?  All you have to do is tell me what that is and I will go and get it.  I would also like to provide more evidence: In a TED talk by Bill Gates called 'Innovating to Zero,' the richest man on earth describes the movement towards Zero C02 emissions by 2050. The way that this will happen is through the expansion of renewable energy infrastructure. Now, in reference to this talk, Bill Gates claims that this effort will also greatly reduce poverty as an extra beneficial result. The biggest reason why this is true is because renewable energy structures, in areas of poverty, will greatly increase the standard of living. This is because small villages and communities of extreme poverty are not usually anywhere near an energy grid.</t>

    <t>Sorry for my long delay, I have been busy  Argument: While it is true that currently the climb of global warming is slow, just wait for the 'point of no return.' Haven't heard of it? There are multiple website talking about it, so go search it up. Anyway, the point of no return is basically the fact that when global warming reaches a point of badness, it will tumble, pick up speed, and there will be no way to stop it. One example of this are the polar ice caps melting. As more ice melts, there is more water to attract warmth. As the water gets warmer, the ice melts faster. See how that could tumble out of control? Now, how does this have to do with anything? Well, there will be a 'runaway' in global warming. What is currently a really small amount increase per year, could very well become catastrophic, maybe even 0.5 degrees a year. And it will be near impossible to stop it. If things don't change by 2020, we will hit the point of no return by 2042. Rising temperatures can cause major drought and wildfires (just look at California,) and it can even cause computers to over heat. Imagine what would happen if hospital machines, machines keeping people alive, over heated because of the 120 or so degree Fahrenheit temperatures that could be seen if we don't stop global warming from tipping to the deep end. If all of a sudden, there were no more wars, how would we get everyone to get together, be friends, and stop global warming in such a small time frame. Remember, most of the world's economies rely of burning coal and oil, which causes global warming. So, even if everyone unified all of a sudden, which isn't very likely, there would be a huge risk of destroying all economies to fix it. And if everyone destroy's their economy to fix global warming, how can they help the others with dead economies. Huh, not very black and white, is it?</t>

    <t>First off, Pro states that plants would be shriveling and dying because of the greater temperature. I'd like to point out that while that is a sobering possibility, it wouldn't be happening anywhere in the near future. According to the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, the global temperature has risen 1.53 (Fahrenheit) since the Industrial Revolution. In about two and a half centuries, our global temperature has only gone up by that non-remarkable amount (0.00612 per year). In 50 years, our global temperature will have risen only .3 degrees Fahrenheit. I don't believe that's a large enough amount to carry any significance in it.  As for the prospect of weighing human lives on a scale, so many more lives would be saved if we were to have world peace. Pro states that wars only occur every 20 or so years and cause tens of millions of inexcusable deaths, however, global warming causes 400,000 deaths a year. I'd like to point out that these figures are questionable, and that even if tens of millions of people did die in these 'superwars' that occur every other decade, the proportion of deaths per year is greater by that of which caused by war. (ten million / 20 = 500,000).  Next, wars don't occur just every 20 years. Especially from our developed country's biased eye, we love to twist figures. Our globe is in chaos right now. Just look at the Yemen Civil War or the infamous ISIS fight. It doesn't take an extremely bloody war to capture our attention.  We have the power to destroy ourselves right now, and the only thing stopping us from doing so is the knowledge that others contain that power also.  War is a terrible thing, and world cooperation would be the easiest solution to our problems.</t>

    <t>Alright. First things first (I'm the realest..gosh that song's old), if we were to ensure the cooperation of our world organization, then we could accomplish so much more! Our world is run on money and competition. Greed is embodied into our human nature. However, if we were to collaborate, we could tackle this problem of global warming together. Thus, world peace places a higher priority on our list than global warming. Next, let's again remind ourselves that the rate of increase in temperature is 0.00612 degrees Fahrenheit per year. This minuscule figure tells us that we should have nothing to worry about. Therefore, I'd like to kindly remind Pro to chill out (pun intended) and remember that the world isn't anywhere near falling over the pit yet. Because of our natural urge to want more for ourselves, yes, we do fight wars over resources. Pro states it himself-they can contribute to the fire that fuels the flame for a war. However, we are nowhere near burning up.  Therefore, I conclude my argument, and thus, the debate, with the notion that our society as the human race should focus on discontinue our quarrels and turn our eyes to the greater issues.

That's going to be hard to fix if all the plants are shriveling and dying because of the over-livable heat! Many websites say that if global warming was stopped, it would help world peace a lot. Oil and coal are major contributors in a strong economy, and can be a large point in a war. If we stop global warming by not burning and using the resources, we no longer have that strong reason to go to war. Also, global warming is causing a lot more than fiercer storms. Lots of people may die in wars, but how many people are dying by abnormally large tsunamis and hurricanes, which are larger due to global warming. War happens once every 20 or so years and kill a few ten million each time, which is a lot and is inexcusable. Global warming, however, kills about 400,000 people a year[1] (through means of tsunamis, hurricanes, etc.), and that number is constantly growing. True, it currently doesn't kill as many as wars do, but what about in 50 years? </t>

    <t>Global Warming. It is our biggest issue. I didn't choose world peace because we were always be fighting. For as long as we have lived, we have fought. And yet, we are still alive and 'healthy'. Global warming, on the other hand, is a new problem. A new problem that isn't going away. Our ice caps are melting, raising our temperatures and killing hundreds of arctic animals. By raising temperatures, it's evaporating more water, making the ground dryer, making it harder for plants to grow. Less plants, less food, less people. Not to mention the fact that it's incredibly uncomfortable to be in super hot weather. Plus, if global warming is stopped by no longer burning oil, there is no longer the danger of what would happen if there is no more oil to burn. In short, wars will always be a problem, but it will never threaten our extinction. Unless stopped, global warming will.</t>

    <t>To consider this resolution and evaluate both possible solutions a few things must be established. Firstly, the main value that both sides are defending is the value of human life. The common goal is saving the most possible humans. The pro side will be arguing that preparation is fundamental and necessary to achieve this while the con should be arguing that reducing the damage to the environment is enough. Before I lay out my arguments I would like to make one clarification: the pro side is not arguing that prevention is the ultimate solution. Instead, we will prove that it should be the immediate and necessary action.  These are our reasons:  1. We will suffer the consequences of climate change. (It will rise above 2 C).  The vast majority of scientists agree that a rise in the average temperature of the world above 2 degrees Celsius from before industrial levels will be extremely catastrophic to the human population. This is a very alarming fact because we have already risen 1 degree above these industrial levels, and from the current course we have set our industries on, it is virtually impossible to prevent going above 2 C. This means we WILL deal with the catastrophic damage of climate change! Now the question is what is the best solution to deal with these consequences such as extreme droughts, flooding, harsh storms, etc.? The solution proposed by the the opposition is completely inviable since switching to green energy or any other measure will not save the lives of the people whose house was washed away by floods or who do not have water to drink. I'm from Brazil and recently we have had the worst drought in 50 years. This made a many people realize the importance of the environment and start taking actions to help it, yet that did not solve the immediate problem. People still did not have water to live! Preparation was necessary and would have remediated the issue. This same logic can be applied to the rest of the world. We need to be prepared to face what is coming, and that is why it should be our main goal.  2. Not all nations will agree on preventing climate change; therefore, nations that do not prepare for its effects will be harmed.  One example of this is China, one of the biggest producers of greenhouse gases, which has recently stated that it would not maintain its emission control pledges. As a result of that, it is inevitable that significant damage will occur due to climate change. It is nearly impossible to force countries like this to comply with climate change prevention measures; therefore, it would be more beneficial for the other nations to prepare themselves to the effects of climate change rather than spending trillions on trying to prevent it in vain. How can you ask a small country like the Maldives to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions when the sea is rising and destroying their cities? Even if they did agree to take these measures, because other countries like China don't, the seas will continue to rise. Their main concern currently should be to prepare with the effects of this rise.  3. It would be illogical for a few countries to make the change to green technology because of the magnitude of capital investment in the oil amp; gas industry.  The oil amp; gas industry is a billion dollar industry. Only in the time period 2009-13 more than 3000 billion dollars were invested in the oil amp; gas industry. It is needless to point out the huge negative effects the adoption of green technology would mean for the world economy. The results would be catastrophic and there would be no turning back. Thousands of people would lose their jobs and years of technological developments in the industry would be wasted. It would cost 44 trillion dollars to switch from fossil fuels to green energy. The cost of this is unviable. There are no investors willing to spend that much money on green technology. Logically, the costs would be split. However, given the profits the oil industry brings only a crazy person would spend on green technology. This once again demonstrates how prevention is completely impossible in our world and preparation is the best immediate solution.  4. If climate change prevention does not work, then mankind would have wasted all of its resources into something futile, and we would not be able to survive the effects of climate change.  In order to change the ways of mankind now, we would have to change so many habits that have been ingrained in our society for decades, since the discovery of oil. How we run our factories, how we trade, change all of the packaging on foods, beauty products, even clothing. It is impossible to impede the productions of these items, since nowadays fossil fuels are present all around us. The keyboard you are typing on is made of plastic for example, the case around your phone is plastic as well. It is incoherent to assume that we can slow this process now, so instead of spending trillions on prevention methods that we are not certain can work (they haven't until now), we must start thinking about the future, and preparing for the worst that can come. One of the largest mistakes that humanity makes is to begin something and not look deep enough into the future to know how to control that something. This is not a fatalistic view, it is a cautious one.  For all these reasons, we are arguing that the preparation to deal with climate change should currently be valued above preventing the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Arguing that suddenly changing the path we are on will happen and is viable is thinking of a utopian world. It is a completely inviable solution. The main goal of nations should be to prepare, and later, when the mentality concerning climate change starts to shift, prevention can be discussed.</t>

    <t>No one is denying that climate change is upon us. The present effects of global warming and other forms of climate change are well documented. As we see it, the people of the world have two choices: --shore up our defenses against the worst effects of climate change and hope that we won't eventually be incapable of coping with the rising seas, floods, droughts, disease, etc. that are even now threatening communities on every continent, or  --focus our energies and resources on preventing further climate change damage to mitigate the impact on humanity and planet.  Given the ominous fact that there is nothing that can be done to immediately halt and reverse the effects of climate change, humans need to take the long view. Where will we be in 50 or 100 years if we fail to take steps now to prevent even greater climate change? The effects we are feeling now are so threatening to human health and the ecosystems we depend upon that it is inconceivable we could survive many generations at the current rate of damage. The alternative to real and concerted prevention of further climate change, is to accept a future in which the people of Earth who are not killed by heat waves, mosquito-born diseases, floods, famines and the other inevitable effects of global warming find themselves fighting over the few verdant patches of land high enough to escape seas that have risen [find stat] feet once the polar ice caps have melted completely. The preparation position is a fatalistic one. It accepts the eventual demise of humankind. The only viable position is the prevention of further climate change in hopes of reestablishing ecological balance in the world. No amount of raising levees, recycling water, or distributing mosquito nets will be sufficient over time to save our race and the world from the climate change damage we have put in motion. Given a choice between preparing for the worst, and attempting to prevent the worst--humanity's best hope lies in prevention. We must do everything we can, starting now, to halt the shameful dependence on fossil fuels, the destruction of tropical rainforests, and pumping of hydrocarbons into the air.</t>

Yes the race is advancing from the scratch ,but the fact is not false that this advancement is leading to many problems like climate change,population explosion and global warming.In all these problems technology has its hands . I am not saying that we should go back to the same old primitive age but I what I want to say is that it has made our life hopeless .My opponent has represented the figures of people using Facebook,twitter, instagram .These things possesses a danger of sharing any sensitive information in a blink of eyes .  THE ADVANCEMENT OF TECHNOLOGY HAVE MADE ALL HUMANS BLIND :- The rise of technology have created deadly weapons , the atomic bomb dropped twice on Japan brought to surface the fact that if human minds becomes selfish due to their prestige then its because of technology .The people who dropped the bomb did not even thought for a while what it will bring to the people who face d it. The ravaging wars represent the a greater guilt at the humanity that we are unable to stop these wars .

    <t>== Intro ==  A carbon tax is a tax levied on the carbon content of fuels, which results in most carbon emissions -- emissions of carbon dioxide, which increases temperature, and occasionally carbon monoxide, which is toxic. The resolution says the United States should introduce a carbon tax.  The government legislates pragmatically, based on what benefits and harms the people. The job of the State is to ensure that the people aren't harmed. Thus, government legislation ought to be based on John Stuart Mill's 'harm principle,' which holds that the only purpose for which control can be exercised over a person who doesn't consent to it is to prevent harm to non-consensual others. There are two reasons to accept this. First, the only reason people recognize the government's legitimacy is to prevent harm to themselves and to maximize benefit for themselves. If the government doesn't follow the harm principle, it is illegitimate. Second, the harm principle fits with normal conceptions of ethics in that it prevents harm.  What are the burdens in this debate? The debate is a normative resolution, which means the burdens of persuasion are shared. The word 'should' implies a debate of opinions, and, therefore, requires both sides to justify that opinion. My burden is to show that a carbon tax would be a net benefit to society. Con's burden is to show that it would be a net harm.  == Climate change ==  Global warming is primarily human-caused and poses a fairly significant threat to humanity. Most scientists agree on that. The scientific consensus on climate change is that it's primarily human-caused. Human-emitted greenhouse gases trap insolation within the Earth, and increase its mean temperature. Carbon dioxide has a huge impact on temperature. Research by most scientists confirms so. Leading climatologist JD Annan uses a Bayesian statistical approach, which is 'dominant in the literature,' and finds that mean temperature would increase by 3 degrees Celsius per doubling of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. [1] That would mean carbon dioxide is responsible for around 70% of global warming.  The effects of climate change on humans is severe. There's immense urgency as to the effect of climate change, and the problem is on a huge scale. If greenhouse emissions continue at the current rate, climate change will make the planet uninhabitable to humans. [2]  A carbon tax would act to mitigate global warming. With a tax on carbon emissions, it will deter people from using carbon-content fuels at high levels, therefore reducing carbon emissions. Carbon taxation is not very costly, and has been proven to be effective at reducing emissions, therefore mitigating the threat of global warming. Research has shown that Norway's carbon tax has reduced carbon-based pollution by 20%. [3]  == Nuclear power ==  Implementing a carbon tax will deter people from using carbon-based fuels. That much has been established by lots of research, and has been observed in Norway's carbon tax. Logically, it entails that people will look for alternatives. Most people agree that nuclear power will present significant competition to coal energy if a carbon tax is enacted. [4] Nuclear power poses a net benefit to society. Nuclear power further helps mitigate the threat of climate change. It's more efficient than many other forms of energy, and produces the most electricity in relation to it's minimal environmental impact.  Nuclear power is helpful, because it has very little pollution and poses a viable power source. Therefore, it's a benefit to the plan.  Climate change poses a harm to people. A carbon tax would mitigate that harm. The government's job is to prevent or reduce harm. For those reasons, vote Pro. </t>

    <t>I'm disappointed that my opponent forfeited. It's considered common courtesy that you have a no-forfeit guarantee when you apply in the comments section of the debate. I'll crystallize my points and show you why you should vote Pro:  There's immense urgency to the crisis of climate change now. Temperatures are rising at rates much faster than people think. Carbon dioxide concentrations are constantly rising, and if they're doubled, it'll mean a three-degree Celsius rise in temperature. At the current rate of carbon emissions, the human race will go extinct. I understand that there are studies doubting the impact of global warming, and many researchers think the climate sensitivity is at 1.1 degrees Celsius. But there are various studies that show much higher climate sensitivities. Many of these studies use climate models, which many skeptical researchers -- and even some members on this site who believe in anthropogenic global warming, such as 16k -- doubt, but the consensus is that climate models work. And there are many non-modeling studies as well, such as the one I cited by JD Annan, that uses a Bayesian statistical approach, which is the dominant method in the literature. All of these entail a major urgency to climate change.  Of course, many people -- even those who actually acknowledge this -- just sit in front of their computers debating, and don't stop to ponder how huge the impact is. It's enormous. Stop for a second and close your eyes, and imagine if conditions were as I'm saying. Don't just think 'ok, this is a debate, this is fun to read,' or don't be just a judge for this debate, or a person who's interested. Think as a person who actually cares for the race, and for their own lives. Imagine heat waves everywhere killing many. Imagine floods, many more storms, and multiple phenomena causing them. Many satirists have jokes -- extremely realistic ones -- on how people just care about those that died in a flood just for those two weeks or so. I, like most other humans, was like that; I cared, but I soon forgot. Until I experienced the devastation caused by floods, and witnessed the sheer human fear and panic that's so inherent. Just post the Chennai floods, there was a rumor that a dam's wall had collapsed -- and at that moment, those that had lost so much just ran, and you could see the fear in their faces. The rumor was a false one. But that helped me appreciate how serious any loss is. Nearly dying changes nothing. Someone else dying changes nothing. But dying changes everything. Ponder for a moment about that, and imagine the sheer impact caused by climate change. That can be mitigated by a carbon tax.  Imagine the reduction in fear. Think of that slight mitigation that could prevent the brutal, horrifying specter of change and death. Just creating a tax would stop that. It would mitigate heat waves and flooding. 'Burning all fossil fuels . . . would make most of this planet uninhabitable to humans.' [2] That's why you should vote Pro. The magnitude of the impact is so immense, it's close to nuclear impacts in 'North Korea vs Iran' policy debates. I'm sure most people didn't imagine a debate about taxation comes to that -- but it does.  Nuclear power is another, smaller, impact. There's little question that nuclear power is immensely beneficial to society. It doesn't pollute much, there's a very low risk of emergency scenarios, and it benefits the economy. A carbon tax increases that. It's much simpler than the above impact.  For these reasons, vote Pro.</t>

<h>The word 'main' as used in the debate heading presents the position that humanity's contribution to global warming is greater in magnitude than any other factor. The definition of 'main' could be explained as: chief or principal in rank, importance, size, etc. Therefore, Pro must prove that the human portion is in fact the largest of factors. Of course, the human portion needn't be greater than 50% of the total effect if there are multiple elements/factors at play. I also agree that it is more than possible that human activities could affect, change or initiate natural processes, but again, that would have to be quantified (what portion of a natural system has been altered by human elements versus natural change). Natural and human effect can be intertwined and extremely complicated, if not impossible to differentiate and separate. This is referred to as the 'attribution of recent climate change'. I will reference the following scholarly article: https://gfdl.noaa.gov... 'Detection and Attribution of Recent Climate Change: A Status Report'. The authors make several important conclusions in this comprehensive study: 'Greenhouse warming alone is insufficient to explain the observed pattern of climate change.' and 'The most probable cause of the observed warming is a combination of internally and externally forced natural variability and anthropogenic sources (see also Tett et al. 1999). But given the large model uncertainties and limited data, a reliable weighting of the different factors contributing to the observed climate change cannot currently be given. In short, we cannot attribute, at this time, with a high level of statistical significance, the observed changes in global and large-scale regional climate to anthropogenic forcing alone.'. This research contradicts Pro's assertion that human causes are definitively more important than natural ones. In addition, to say that our current warming trend was caused solely by the industrial age based on the chart I presented (in round 3) would be to dismiss the fact that the sharp rebound from the Little Ice Age and commencement of our current warming trend (1600-) was initiated and occurred well before human activity was a relevant factor. I agree with much of the content contained within the two sites referenced by pro, but none of them contains information that establishes that human activity plays a greater role than natural variability. The CO2 now website asserts that 'The human impact on climate during this era greatly exceeds that due to known changes in natural processes, such as solar changes and volcanic eruptions.' and lists several of the unique contributions and circumstances associated with human activity and greenhouse gasses. It also states that 'the radiative forcing from human activities is much more important for current and future climate change than the estimated radiative forcing from changes in natural processes.' These are grand statements, but there is no attempt to quantify them unlike the formal research document I presented above (which contradicts these sites). There is also no mention on Pro's sites of the fact that our current warming period was initiated well before the industrial age and human influence by natural forces. Even the IPCC continues to protect its reputation by using vague terms such as '...likely' regarding the position of humanity's '...dominant role in global warming'. I acknowledge that we currently are experiencing global warming. For those who lived in 1100 BC and 1300 AD, they also experienced global warming on a larger scale than we do today, even though human activity had little correlation to that warming. Thus, to say that Global Warming is unique to the industrial age is false. It is also very likely that scientists will one day be able to prove/quantify what portion of Human Activity is attributable to global warming. Presently, it is not possible as my opponent acknowledges. This is why no scientist(s) or scientific body has declared a victory on this issue (A quantified attribution of recent climate change). In fact, a very large amount of money and large amount of research continues to be spent on this very issue because it has yet to be proved or resolved. I also agree that the current warming period presented on the on the chart I referenced is abrupt and is likely a reflection of the influence of human activity. Being that this warming period has yet to exceed several recent warming periods in effect and duration, we need more time in order to be able to place our current warming period into the context of other prior larger warming periods. It is simply premature to state definitively that human activity is the main factor in global warming. My statement is reflected in the current feverish rate of research being performed into the Attribution of Recent Climate Change. If a definitive conclusion had been reached, this research would not be needed to such a degree. Keep in mind, that I am not advocating that humanity should not take responsibility towards reducing our greenhouse gas emissions; quite the contrary.</h>

    <t>I never said that Mankind is the sole cause of global warming. I'm saying they are the main cause of global warming. According to the chart provided by Con in the previous argument, we are supposed going through a clod period. Then how come that 14 of the 15 hottest years are in the 21st century? This is shown in Wiki page of Global Warming. Therefore I respectfully say that the site might be wrong. Its true , there have been cold periods every year. But I think those are called winters. Another reason. Global Warming is primarily caused by emission of GHGs, or Greenhouse gases. The primary sources of GHGs are factories and automobiles . Which are human sources. The only major contributor from the natural side are trees which only emit CO2 during the night. Whereas human sources include, CO, CO2, nitrous oxide, methane and other synthetic chemicals emitted is vapour form by humans. And with the tree population declining, and not many volcanoes in the past 10 years, the GHG emission by nature are not that significant as mankind. And contrary to common perception there has not been any cool period, the average surface temperature of the planet has been constantly increasing. The concentration of CO2 has been up about 20% from 650,000 years ago. Con has failed to rebut the argument of radioactive forcing which was in one of my sources. Just because its contribution cannot be quantified, doesn't mean it is not the major contributor. In the above site, research has indicated that natural causes do not explain the recent climate changes . ( Ever since the Industrial Revolution). The site also gives the natural causes of climate change. 1)Variations in the sun's energy reaching Earth 2)Changes in the reflectivity of Earth's atmosphere and surface 3)Changes in the greenhouse effect, which affects the amount of heat retained by Earth's atmosphere 1)Its true that there have been changes in the Sun's energy reaching the Earth but none big enough to cause such a change in surface temperature ALONE. 2) The constant GHG emissions have damaged our ozone layer and are causing UV rays to enter the atmosphere which is also increase the temperature of the planet. Again . A human source. 3) The changes in the GreenHouse effect, is that we humans have been constantly increasing the amount of GHGs in the atmosphere in our quest for development and comfort. A human source. 4) There have been no volcanic eruptions, atleast not big enough for the atmosphere to change and for the aerosol count to become so high.

    <t>First of all I would like to apologise for themy forfeiture, as my internet connection was not available for a few days. I hope that voters disregard the forfeit. My opening statements. 1) Humanity IS the main cause of global warming.The IPCC Report of 2015 states: Its extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 wascaused by the anthropogenic increase in GHG concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together. The best estimate of the human-induced contribution to warming is similar to the observed warming over this period . Anthro-pogenic forcings have likely made a substantial contribution to surface temperature increases since the mid-20th century over every continental region except Antarctica.. Anthropogenic influences have likely affected the global water cycle since 1960 and contributed to the retreat of glaciers since the 1960s and to the increased surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet since 1993. Anthropogenic influences have very likely contributed to Arctic sea-ice loss since 1979 and have very likely made a substantial contribution to increases in global upper ocean heat content (0''700 m) and to global mean sea level rise observed since the 1970s.'One of the major contributions to global warming is caused by automobiles, a man made i.e. anthropogenic industry.Other include garbage disposal, factories, burning of leaves , bonfires etc. All of these are anthropogenic causes. 2) One could argue that global warming would take place with or without humanity , but that is not and would not have been the case. Global warming is not JUST the warming of the Earth , it is the EXCESSIVE warming of the Earth's atmosphere. 3) The following site also concludes that mankind is the main contributing factor of global warming. My Rebuttals 1) Con's source itself says that human activities have contributed substantially to climate change I.e. global warming. 2) I didn't know that global warming consisted of parts. Global warming, simply put is the heating up of the earth, which is mainly caused by greenhouse gases which are emitted by both anthropogenic and natural sources. But the amount is substantially more by man made sources. 3) Another reason given by Con's site is the sun's reflectivity , which can also be altered by human activities. 4) This debate is not whether this is the Little Ice Age or any other age. Its about mankind's impact on global warming. 5) Even if the role of Ice Age is as important as it is alleged, it cannot overtake the impact of civilization and development.</t>

    <t>I will restate, than in order to establish that the primary cause of global warming is human activity, it is necessary to quantify the amount and effect (not qualify). No scientist or scientific body to date, to my knowledge, has been able to do so. Specifically, anyone making the assertion that humans are the primary cause of global warming must scientifically establish/prove what percentage is human as compare to natural variability and natural causes. It is not good enough to use terms such as 'significant' and 'substantially' as they are extremely vague inconclusive terms. An even worse approach is to take the line of reasoning presented on the timeforchange.org site referenced by my opponent, which virtually ignores the question/possibility of natural factors. I will reference the following chart by Climatologist Cliff Harris and Meteorologist Randy Mann to illustrate my position. Note that on this chart there have been two periods with higher and more prolonged global warming periods in 1100 BC and 1300 AD (up to two-fold greater). My opponent also dismissed the importance of the naturally occurring little ice-age, yet its effect was over three-fold greater than our so called current 'human' caused warming period. Being that natural causes are scientifically established to have created global temperature swings 3 times larger, and hundreds of years longer in duration than our current warming period (as recent as 1600 - 1800 AD), it is complete pseudo-science to claim that natural cycles play an insignificant role in global temperature change. In fact, being that we are presently in a period where we would naturally expect to see a warming period in the natural global temperature cycle, one would expect that human activity would have created the largest warming event in the last 5000 years. The chart/link I presented establishes that this kind of warming simply hasn't happened. The evidence I presented could even be used as an argument that Mankind's impact on global warming is negligible as compared to natural variability. Lastly, I acknowledge that my sources attribute a portion of climate change to human activity, but again, 'significant' and 'substantially' is not a quantification as I asserted earlier. I would ask that my opponent reference scholarly material that definitively establishes that human activity outweighs all other possible natural elements and variables in global climate change.</t>

    <t>Firstly. I have not quantified anything in the heading of the debate. I've said 'main cause'. Not 'more than fifty percent' or somethinglike that. Main means a major portion. Since when did 'substantially' get used for a small portion? And it is also not my possible (to my knowledge) to quantify the impact of natural causes on climate change as it is unpredictable and can change any time. Con has also left out my point that human activities can alter the natural conditions of the earth, therefore any change in temperature due to natural causes could have a human factor behind it. As explained in the following.  Secondly, I never said natural causes play an insignificant role. I said they play an important role but not as important as human causes. In con's reference chart, the temperature has been constantly oscillating between hot and cold, but if you check recent years there have been almost two constant hot periods and the cold period is almost invisible ( in the graph I mean) meaning it is very short. And then in the graph itself it clear that the hot periods have been on the rise since the Age of Induatrialization. And after 2015, the cold period is based on assumptions and predictions, and as I have already made clear that nature cannot always be predicted. Thirdly Global Warming is a reality. Just because there have hotter periods before, doesn't mean it is not happening. The following site also explains that the global warming hiatus in recent times is not true. And that climate only causes short term changes in the climate of the earth, but human activity causes long term changes. Fourthly scientists will not quanitfy and agree that mankind is responsible for global warming, as it is their community that are primary responsible (in humans). But I will not defame them as some ARE trying their best to prove it. Fifthly , again I refer to the chart provided by Con, the hot periods have gradually developed over a period of time, but in recent years its almost at a right angle. Which means there have been sharp and quick increase in the heat all over the globe.</t>

    <t>Yes, I agree with Pro's sources in Round 5 that list all of the ways in which human activity plays a role in affecting global climate. Unfortunately, Pro failed to acknowledge the issue of 'Attribution of Recent Climate Change' which I brought up in Round 4. Without doing so, it is impossible to conclude that '...Humanity is the Main Cause of Global Warming' as Pro has done. To further bolster my argument, I will reference the 376 page scholarly book (published in 2015) 'Climate Change, Multidecadal and Beyond' which flatly states outright in the introduction 'Many questions concerning the nature and causes of climate variability on the multidecadal time scale are still unresolved.'. This book also references a Technical Summary of the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report which acknowledges 'Difficulties remain in attributing temperature changes at smaller than continental scales and over time scales less than 50 years.' (Solomon et al., 2007). While generalist websites for the public (such as the ones referenced by pro) may ignore the issue of attribution, clearly scholars and climate scientists cannot and do not. The book I referenced demonstrates that scientists are working very hard on the attribution issue, and may resolve it in the near future thanks to ever improving technology, statistics and modeling. However, being that the world's top scientists have not resolved the issue of climate change attribution, it is far too premature for 'pro' declare a victory or a conclusion that humanity is the 'main' cause of climate change (based on the information contained in generalist websites), especially in the context of a Multidecadal view. I was very much hoping that Pro would address the issue of 'Attribution of Recent Climate Change' which I introduced in Round 4. In conclusion, I would like to thank my opponent for a robust and civil debate on this important issue.</t>

    <t>In deference to my opponents forfeiture of the first round, I would make the opening statement for this debate. I do not dispute the existence and reality of Global Warming. I do assert, however, that it is impossible to quantify on a global scale, what part of global warming is attributable to Human activities as compared to natural change. Therefore, to state that humanity is the main cause of global warming is, at time present, impossible to prove. Geographers and Geologists consider the state of the Earth at time present to be in an ice age, albeit a late stage. This means that there have been periods in the history of the earth with less ice coverage, higher sea levels, and warmer mean global temperatures. As an example, a major component of the Glacial retreat we are witnessing today is attributable to natural rebound from the little ice age (approximately 1300 to 1850). Certainly human activity has amplified this rebound, but to what degree is indefinable. There are also many other potential amplifying factors, a few of which are listed on the Environmental Protection Agencies Website. Note, that even this reputable website is unable to quantify human contribution vs natural causes. I will also cite an article on the little ice-age for the benefit of my opponent. I would also refer my opponent to the regional research of Glaciologist Dr. Johannes Koch regarding glacial retreat in Garibaldi Park (and other regional locations) which document the geological evidence of glacial retreat since the Little Ice Age glacial extant. The immense role of the Little Ice Age on climate is well established in this research.</t>

<h>Framework:Economic Globalization: “The trans-national increase in trade and capital transfers across national boundaries.” [http://tinyurl.com...] If I can prove economic globalization will have a net negative effect, I win. If my opponent proves the converse, he/she wins. Environmental Concerns:Generally, as income increases, so does production and consumption. These trends facilitate a rampant increase in pollution. Obviously, pollution isn’t something that is a net positive for society or for environment, as environment destruction has a subsequent negative effect on society. Pollution, as it is increased by economic globalization, creates an “Inverse-U” graph of environmental decay, called the Kuznets Curve. Environmental degradation is an irreversible cost of economic globalization, as demonstrated by the graph below:     [http://www.trunity.net...] Essentially, when economic globalization begins, the short-term effects on environment are empirically harmful. However, assuming economic globalization is successful in poverty reduction, the curve is completed and environmental degradation slows. Regardless, the initial impact on environment is irreversible and extremely harmful. For the preservation of the environment, it’s imperative we don’t utilize economic globalization as an international policy.This point is important, and I think it needs further explanation. It’s necessary to understand the effects of globalization are far-reaching, not confined to developed or developing countries. It applies to both of them, and that’s a basis for global environmental degradation. Though some proponent’s of economic globalization assert the Kuznet’s curve flattens its environmental effects, this does not include CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions. Increase in production and consumption and easily induce further CO2 emissions, which subsequently results in global warming. There is “No evidence that Kuznet’s curve for CO2 ever turns down on its own.” [1]Global warming is a subsequent effect of CO2 [2], and it’s generally common knowledge -- being backed by empirical studies [3] CO2 emissions are generally and primarily caused by increased production, which is what economic globalization facilitates. If it increases production, the only logical consequence is then furthered global warming.Besides CO2 emissions, SO2 (sulfur oxide) emissions, which are pollutants [5], are another facet of considerable concern in regards to economic globalization. Yong S. Cho of Korea University explained in a study that there exists “a negative long-run relationship between SO2 emissions and income for developed countries…” [4] This clearly isn’t a positive consequence as there is less income. Even with SO2 emissions regressing, the effect on developing countries outweighs this slight benefit. The study continues, “while trade liberalization appears to increase environmental quality in developed economies, it has a detrimental effect on environmental quality in most developing countries.” Essentially, slight reduction in SO2 emissions in developed countries has little effect when weighed against *increased* emissions in developing countries and long-term lower income in developed nations.Aside from these two specific negative impacts, the total impact is negative, as indicated by studies. The foundation of this conclusion rests on one main point: the “race-to-the-bottom” theory, which will be addressed in further contentions. Because of this, the environmental degradation facilitated by economic globalization is both highly detrimental and irreversible.Labor Implications:The “race-to-the-bottom” theory is essentially constructed of the idea that “to the extent that countries are open to international trade and investment, environmental standards will be lower than they would otherwise be.” [6] Competition is a primary factor of economics and the standards by which corporations and countries lead their policies and practices. When competition becomes international rather than limited to nation-wide, companies lower labor standards to compensate for increased competition. Lowered labor standards facilitate and directly alter labor practices in a regressive manner.  [http://cdn.static-economist.com...] The graph above exemplifies the impact of lower labor standards on practices, and demonstrates the regressive trend over a period of 17 years. The graph is derived from an empirical time-series investigation study conducted by Ronald B. Davies of UCD School of Economics. [7] The study typifies these concerns: economic globalization has a net negative impact on labor practices and econometric spatial lag between the labor-rights index and actual labor practices. Lower labor standards allows unethical labor and wage abuse to employees, which could potentially apply to every working individual. This is a huge problem in regards to generating a net benefit. The Economist summarizes the findings as such: “If the labour standards across all other countries decline, those of the excepted country also tend to fall.” [9] These demonstrate the negative effects of economic globalization, and affirm the “race-to-the-bottom” theory.Moreover, the same conclusion can be applied to regulations in environmental protection, indicating due to increased competition, regulations would be lowered to lure polluting businesses to contribute to their GDP. These large companies would settle in areas with the least environmental prevention to their company. The same study from Harvard [6] explains, “by limiting trade and investment in some way, we might be able to attain a better environment for any given level of GDP.” This would negatively affect the environment as these companies would be permitted to release vast amounts of emissions known to contribute to global warming and general degradation of the environment. But beyond environmental attributes, labor practices and the facilitation of income inequality. Osvaldo Sunkel, professor of economics in Chile explains, “Since the [19]80s, when the new [globalization] policies have been implemented more or less all over the world, income distribution has worsened, both within countries and among countries.” [8] Income distribution is being degraded by economic globalization since the 1980s, and no evidence seem to suggest that trend will skew in favor of economic globalization. Indeed, Marc Bacchetta, economics research and statistics division of the World Trade Organization, furthers that globalization results in an “economy [that] is characterized by less job security, lower incomes, an absence of access to a range of social benefits and fewer possibilities to participate in formal education and training programmes – in short, the absence of key ingredients of decent work opportunities.” [10] Opportunities for “most” individuals to obtain “good” jobs are lacking, labor standards are degrading, and income inequality is rampant; all of these necessitate refraining from economic globalization.Conclusion:Due to large concerns in regards to the environment and the implications on labor, economic globalization does not generate a net benefit and certainly is not appealing or desirable. </h>

We have been doing economic globalization for years sense we invest money over seas and even have people that work for us companies over seas. To stop now would make it so we lose a lot of money.  2. Due to economic globalization nation's economies increase, and more money flows into these nations. A lot of these nations need that money to try to being moderation programs in these nations. Some such nations that have benefited from it in such a way is china. After china opened it doors for economic trading china's economy greatly increased and the nation started to become more modern because of it. Another nation that is also benefiting economically from globalization is India. India's economy had a strong growth rate until the global recession in 2008. But it is continuing to recover from  3. Due to trade deals witch is a result of economic globalization nations now have access to food they other wise wouldn't have. For example you can now go to a market place and buy banana's from nations all the way in Africa. They helps both nations, because now that nation that sold the bananas will have more money going into there economy. The nation that bought them can now sell them to the people in that nation.  4. Also due to economic globalization companies are starting to open stores in third world nations that originally did not have them. This is a great thing for these nations, for these companies need people to fill in new jobs. So there are more workers now in the workplace, witch means more money is now going back into the economy. This will help the people there, and help aging bring the government closer to being a first world nation. These new jobs will help create a whole new marketplace in some cases and there business will boom. Here is a great example of this, aging I will use India. Due to globalization more IT, and technological jobs are opening up in India. This causes more to be in the work force, and aging benefit the nation by more money going into it.

<h>Rebuttals1. Isolation if we don't accept globalizationThis point is objectively false for a number of reasons:1. First of all, this is the black or white (false dilemma) fallacy. My opponent falsely asserts there is only two options: isolation, or accepting economic globalization. However, this is quite false, as there are other options, similar to the one for which I advocate.2. Per the definition, which my opponent did not attest or challenge (and thereby accepts), economic globalization is 'The trans-national increase in trade and capital transfers across national boundaries.' [1] Increase, as denoted, is the key word here. Not accepting economic globalization doesn't prohibit trade, it just doesn't advocate for the rampant increase. 3. Thusly, a country isn't by default isolated by nonacceptance of globalization. The claim that the countries would be much poorer is unfounded.2. More money flowHere's a few responses:1. While money can flow in an easy manner, that doesn't necessitate countries being richer. In fact, I've shown how labor implications render this point false.2. My evidence points to the fact that income distribution has worsened. Job opportunities have failed because of this (my evidence also supports this) and subsequent poverty is not solved.3. In the end the flow of money =/= to a richer population, as the money can become transparent for the common people.3. Economic globalization and bananasA couple of responses here, as well:1. Trading, again, doesn't require economic globalization. Before the term was even implicit of an increase in trading, trading existed.2. The rampant increase, as economic globalization would advocate, actually detriments the environment, as I've demonstrated. This would logically destroy the environment in which bananas grow. How can we justifiably advocate for something that would harm banana trade? The argument here is turned: environmental impact of globalization destroys the banana assertion.4. OutsourcingI have some responses of clarification and argumentation:1. What my opponent is claiming here is not just globalization, it's outsourcing. Yet, this doesn't justify globalization for a few reasons as I'll mention.2. Outsourcing is harmful. While it is acclaimed to be good for individual business, it has unintended consequences, a few of which include the following: '[it] leads to fragmentation and disintegration of the supply chain, inviting new competitors into the industry. It also nurtures corporate complacency; and it undermines a company’s relations with its labor, customers, and the domestic and local communities.' [2] These harms can lead it to being a bad business strategy as well as bad for the individual.3. Outsourcing lowers quality. CBS News notes 'Many firms that provide outsourcing quickly cut the quality of component parts in order to increase their margins.' [3] Desperation leads companies to cut down on quality to make more cash for their business itself.4. Outsourcing in regards to progress. Global research finds 'Beginning in 2002 the US began running trade deficits in advanced technology products with Asia, Mexico and Ireland. As these countries are not leaders in advanced technology, the deficits obviously stem from US offshore manufacturing. In effect, the US is giving away its technology, which is rapidly being captured, while US firms reduce themselves to a brand name with a sales force.' [4] Instead of helping the outsourcing nation, it erodes their dominance. Moreover, labor standards and practices in these outsourced companies is despicable. [5] It's not progress for poverty alleviation and human rights activism when a consequence of globalization degrades labor practices as well as the labor laws themselves.Conclusion:Environmental concerns coupled with labor concerns should be sufficient to negating the resolution.

<h>I look forward to this debate.  First, I'd like to refer to the statement made by Phil Jones. This is not what he stated. His analysis is often misused to debunk climate change. The meaning of no statistically significant warning between 1995 and 2006 is not disclaiming weather warming. He's discussing the ability to detect a warming trend over a short period of time. Measuring climate over a short term has many variables; noisy factors. Hence, the resulting measurements do not have statistical significance. But extending measurements over a long term does have significance.  --'Over 31,000 scientists have signed on to a petition saying humans aren't causing global warming including 9,029 with a PHD''  I believe this is in reference to the Global Warning Petition Project. This endeavor has been deemed propaganda. Its originators were backed by Exxon. Need I say more?  Yes, recent measurements of the ice caps do indicate an increase. Yet again, one has to look at the variables. In part, the results are reflective on how the ice caps were measured. Measurement of ice cap thickness is relatively new. Also, the results are again based on a short period of time; a single year. Data collected since 1970 shows the ice caps have shrunk 40%.  --'Al Gore predicted all the Arctic ice would be gone by 2013''  Al Gore is not a scientist. He's a retired politician.

    <t>Through analysis of ice cores, data has shown that prior to 1950, for 650,000 years, carbon dioxide levels have been below 300 parts per million. Since 1950 this level has sharply climbed to 400 parts per million. These numbers take into account solar cycles and earth's rotational variations over time. Also, since 1880 the global surface temperatures have continued to rise. Ninety six cubic miles of ice sheets have been lost just between 2002 and 2005 alone.  Surface temperature increases and ice melts have also significantly affected the oceans. Cold water sinks from the arctic regions and circulates toward the equator where it rises and warms to return back to where it came pushed by winds and currents. This is what keeps the earth's temperature rather temperate (within a specific range) in comparison to other planets. As temperatures rise and water warms this cycle slows, creating greater weather pattern fluctuations. Oceanic animals have become stressed due to the warming of habitat and desalination due to excess fresh water infusion. This is especially prevalent in coastal regions.  Together with the CO2 emissions due to fossil fuel use, additional methane is being released from melting permafrost in the arctic regions. As the permafrost melts methane produced from decaying organic matter increases, adding additional greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</t>

    <t>Let me jump right in. You claim that the 97% of scientists absolutely do not side with the notion that global warming is man-made. Quite the opposite, the issue of global warming is a fatal by-product from years of pollution and toxic waste dumping that has called for a need for a change in. Illustrating this point, various organizations are able to prove that 97% of scientists agree that global warming is man-made.

Legates, Willie Soon, William M. Briggs, Christopher Monckton of BrenchleyAbstract: Agnotology is the study of how ignorance arises via circulation of misinformation calculated to mislead. Legates et al. (Sci Educ 22:2007–2017, 2013) had questioned the applicability of agnotology to politically-charged debates. In their reply, Bedford and Cook (Sci Educ 22:2019–2030, 2013), seeking to apply agnotology to climate science, asserted that fossil-fuel interests had promoted doubt about a climate consensus. Their definition of climate 'misinformation' was contingent upon the post-modernist assumptions that scientific truth is discernible by measuring a consensus among experts, and that a near unanimous consensus exists. However, inspection of a claim by Cook et al. (Environ Res Lett 8:024024, 2013) of 97.1 % consensus, heavily relied upon by Bedford and Cook, shows just 0.3 % endorsement of the standard definition of consensus: that most warming since 1950 is anthropogenic. Agnotology, then, is a two-edged sword since either side in a debate may claim that general ignorance arises from misinformation allegedly circulated by the other. Significant questions about anthropogenic influences on climate remain. Therefore, Legates et al. appropriately asserted that partisan presentations of controversies stifle debate and have no place in education.Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the literature: A re-analysis(PDF) [Archive](Energy Policy, Volume 73, pp. 701-705, October 2014)- Richard S. J. TolAbstract: A claim has been that 97% of the scientific literature endorses anthropogenic climate change (Cook et al., 2013. Environ. Res. Lett. 8, 024024). This claim, frequently repeated in debates about climate policy, does not stand. A trend in composition is mistaken for a trend in endorsement. Reported results are inconsistent and biased. The sample is not representative and contains many irrelevant papers. Overall, data quality is low. Cook's validation test shows that the data are invalid. Data disclosure is incomplete so that key results cannot be reproduced or tested.Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the literature: Rejoinder(PDF) [Archive](Energy Policy, Volume 73, pp. 709, October 2014)- Richard S. J. TolAbstract: In my critique of Cook et al. (2013), I raised a number of issues (Tol, 2014). Cook et al. (2014) respond to a few only. They do not dispute(1) that their sample is not representative,(2) that data quality is low,(3) that their validation test is not passed,(4) that they mistake a trend in composition for a trend in endorsement,(5) that the majority of the investigated papers that take a position on (anthropogenic) climate change in fact do not examine any evidence, and(6) that there are inexplicable patterns in the data.Comment on 'Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature' (PDF) [Archive](Environmental Research Letters, Volume 10, Number 3, March 2015)- Benjamin John Floyd DeanAbstract: I read the study by Cook et al with great interest [1]. The study used levels of endorsement of global warming as outlined in their table 2; however, I could see no mention as to how these levels were created and how reliable they were in terms of both inter-rater and intra-rater reliability (Cohen's kappa). Best practice on rater reliability indicates that both inter-rater and intra-rater should have been measured and documented in a study such as Dr Cook's [2] and I am surprised that this fact appears to have been neglected. It would be of considerable benefit to readers for some robust rate reliability metrics to be included, if at all possible.</t>

    <t>Kind regards, no, I don't forfeit rounds, I'm just a little busy at the moment due to University. Final Round:First of all I would like to address my previous statement regarding the FAO report. While it most certainly provides evidence, it also is contradicted by many different sources. However, if my statement is read again, it clearly states that 'they', and not it, is to be trusted, meaning the other reports or apparent evidence used by 'Cowspiracy'. As for Pro's statement that 'Again you assert wri.org is more trust worthy without proving it. Basically Con is stating that the World resource institute WRI is more reputable than the FAO Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.', no, that is not what I am saying. Also, if you want to play the 'prove game', prove that your sources are trustworthy. That will bring us nowhere. The point to be addressed is that the FAO report, while the full report is seemingly not accessible, parts of it are, includes many sources of data potentially unrelated to to factory farming, such as deforestation and cropping. 'Meat industry sources object to the methodology used in the UN report, notably that deforestation for livestock was included in the calculations. These sources point out that pasture-grass-feeding, such as is common in New Zealand, may lead to lower emissions attributable to livestock, despite the fact that methane and nitrous oxide from livestock make up half of New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions.' As well as above, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (quoted from Wikipedia) found 'In 2006, emissions sources contained within the Agricultural Chapters were responsible for emissions of … 6 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.' (currently being around 9%, as stated in round one, but unchallenged by Pro). This, as stated in round one, is evidence for the U.S., a country with, as stated in the previous round, 99% animals being raised under 'factory farming' setting. This would mean that the U.S. could be taken as an example, meaning that, as in the U.S.'s case, factory farming being 99% of farming, yet only producing 9% of Greenhouse gases, which, by the way, is less than the U.S.'s transport emission, that factory farming by no means is the number one cause of man made global climate change. Besides, I would like to point to round one, where factory farming was clearly defined, with no objection of Pro, as 'a system of rearing livestock using highly intensive methods, by which poultry, pigs, or cattle are confined indoors under strictly controlled conditions.'. This means that all of Pro's attempt to define all farming as 'factory farming' are non applicable. Otherwise we could define cattle, such as raised in Australia or huge parts of South America, which by all means can go wherever they want to on properties which are thousands of square kilometres large, as factory farming, because they are still under human control when mustered or 'belong' to humans.. Absolute nonsense. Factory farming is, as stated in round one already, animals being raised indoors, normally in small pens, in an attempt to decrease labour input and maximise output. Also, according to Pro, as the burning of the Amazon rainforest apparently should be counted as 'factory farming', practices such as slash and burn clearing of land for plantations are apparently factory farming as well. It is also to note that Pro has not submitted any facts supporting their thesis that 'factory farming' is the number one cause of man-made global climate change, other than the 18% number, that farming, as factory farming has not even been implicated, other than in the weak reasoning of an attempt to make all farming practices, seemingly plant production included, into factory farming. Conclusion:While Pro has neither provided a valid definition of 'Factory Farming', nor actually provided any evidence that factory farming actually is the number 1 cause of man made global climate change, Con has provided evidence against this. 'The most important factor in this debate is that Pro did not provide a link between the only evidence between the only applicable source used, the FAO report of 2006, which states that livestock creates 18% of Greenhouse gasses, however, Pro does not provide what amount of these 18% is actually 'Factory Farmed'. This means, that possibly the number of Greenhouse gases produced by non factory farmed animals, remembering that factory farming, as stated in round 2, makes up around 40% of livestock numbers. Using logical reasoning, this would mean that non factory farmed animals produce more Greenhouse gases than factory farmed ones by sheer number, also taking into consideration that in a free range farming environment more resources become wasted when compared to factory farming, possibly creating more emissions. Furthermore it needs to be considered that according to many other sources, as supplied by Con, agriculture does, potentially, make up 18% of emissions as the FAO report includes some controversial factors. Pro's inclusion of the Amazon rainforest example cannot be seen as evidence, as in no way does the Greenpeace source provided, as bias as it is, provide a link to 'factory farming'. In fact, all the images Greenpeace has provided display animals freely roaming smoke filled ground resulting in slash and burn, hardly being factory farming, other than some images of animals being drafted, which, once again, is a result of the opposite of factory farming. Factory Farmed animals do not have to be drafted and mustered. The source Pro provided about 51% of emissions created by livestock was already rebutted in round 2 and the comments, as the authors of the source are incapable of conducting simple mathematical calculations. Thus, finally, as Pro has not provided any convincing evidence, or in fact any evidence at all, that factory farming is the number one source of man made global climate change, I, Con, will have to remain with my conclusion posted in round one, that Factory Farming is not the number one cause of man made global climate change.

    <t>Kind Regards for you arguments. Also, I always back up my argument, otherwise it would be opinion and not a proper argument.Rebuttals and arguments:First and foremost I would like to refer to what I wrote in the comments, previous to Pro posting their statement. This was that the sources of 'Cowspiracy', mainly the FAO report, as well as basically all sources of the 'report', cannot be trusted as they are, in no way, academic or trustworthy. As such I will simply quote myself, as to what I said in the comments:'I have studied agriculture, I know what effect agriculture has on the environment very well. However, the majority of agricultural problems arising are not simply from 'factory farming'. (And with that I mean environmental, not solely emission wise)But as for their sources. I will analyse their sources on Greenhouse gases from top to bottom:1.) I cannot access this source. Having read up on it, it is also stated as bias.2.) Same again3.) Not scientific. Also, the authors can't calculate, discrediting them even more. According to them, 7516 million metric tons of CO2e are produced by agriculture (animals) per year, being 11.8% (while previously stating 18%) of the worlds total. They then calculate this up to 32000 million, saying that it is 50%. That would be correct if it was 11.8%, making 100% around 64000 million, however, the world total is 42/46000 million tons CO2e. That means 32000 million is in no way 50%... 18% makes a number around that 100%, meaning the authors can't even do simple maths..4.) The rest is quite unrelated to the topic.'Furthermore it is to note that Pro has not made a clear link between 'Factory Farming' and climate change, but only between Farming and Climate change. However, 'factory farming' makes up under 50% (around 40%) of animal related agriculture, and evidence suggests that non factory farmed animals produce more emission than 'factory farmed' animals, meaning that even they would have a higher emission than 'factory farming'. It is furthermore to state that the graph provided in round 1 is for the U.S, and it is to mention that the U.S. has one of the highest 'factory farming' sectors, with around 99% of agricultural animals held in the U.S. being held in 'factory farming' setting. This would mean that, looking at above graph, factory farming most definitely is not the primary cause of man made global climate change. Pro's sources regarding greenpeace and the amazon rainforest can be disregarded, as they are not linked to factory farming. Conclusion:This means that none of Pro's sources can be seen as evidence that Factory Farming is the number one cause of man made global climate change.

    <t>Kind regards for this debate. I will be representing the Con side, meaning that I will be debating that Factory Farming is not the number 1 cause of man made climate change. First I would like to define 'factory farming', being defined as 'a system of rearing livestock using highly intensive methods, by which poultry, pigs, or cattle are confined indoors under strictly controlled conditions.''Man made' implies that 'made or caused by human beings (as opposed to occurring or being made naturally).' This means that the burning of fossil fuels, while it could occur naturally, occurs 'man made' as the method by which fossil fuels are creating climate change and are by all means man made, as to say that a majority of emissions would not occur, was it not for the human action of burning fossil fuels, thus implying a man made action and resulting in man made climate change.Opening Statement:First I would like to refer to to the World Resources Institute's data showing that the US is one of the highest contributors to emissions. That being said, I will provide the following graph easily showing the little impact farming, not to mention this includes all practices of farming, not just 'factory farming', has on the overall emissions. This graph is provided by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Easy to see, Agriculture has a minimal input of 9% on Greenhouse Gas emissions. Furthermore it is to mention, that according to the source used above, methane, the gas produced by animals, may make up an estimated 30% of emmissions in the Agricultural sector, however, thus only around 3% overall. And this is not even factory farming, just animals in total. Conclusion:As provided by statistics above, Agriculture itself is not even a major contribution to Greenhouse gas emissions, meaning that factory farming, which is an even smaller contributor, is not the number one cause of man made global climate change.

<h>Look at figure 5 in source 1. It clearly shows a massive spike in temperature right after the Little Ice Age. It would be easy to dismiss - except that, if you look closely, you see the temperature trending slightly DOWNWARDS before the Industrial Revolution started. Would we live in a much colder present without the Industrial Revolution's negative climatic effects? It's hard to deny the data, and it's even more of a stretch to say that there's no correlation with the IR.  As you said, carbon levels are rising. You attribute this to volcanoes. Yet volcanoes only produce about 1% of the carbon produced by fossil fuel burning (2). Even if the rate of volcanic eruptions quintupled, this would still not explain the dramatic rise in atmospheric carbon. You also state that climate change is part of some 'natural cycle.' Yet contrary to your beliefs (and, I'll admit, some of my idle thoughts, until I read this article), climate change is definitely not part of the same cycle as the Ice Ages (3). For one thing, it's not happening during the correct alignment of Earth's axis; while we're definitely in a warm period, the temperature should be FALLING, not rising, since the peak of the warm period was a few thousand years ago. Even if climate change WAS caused by the Sun, the troposphere is getting warmer while the stratosphere and -spheres above cool, a fingerprint of greenhouse gas warming. The Sun would be heating all layers equally. That leaves volcanic and oceanic greenhouse gas releases as the only possible candidates - yet they are both tiny climate change contributors, as I explained earlier, and - get this - they actually release a different carbon isotope mix with a different molecular makeup. The oceanic and volcanic carbon has a lower ratio of carbon-12 to carbon-13 - so how do you explain that the ratio has been rising steadily?

    <t>Look at figure 5 in source 1. It clearly shows a massive spike in temperature right after the Little Ice Age. It would be easy to dismiss - except that, if you look closely, you see the temperature trending slightly DOWNWARDS before the Industrial Revolution started. Would we live in a much colder present without the Industrial Revolution's negative climatic effects? It's hard to deny the data, and it's even more of a stretch to say that there's no correlation with the IR.  As you said, carbon levels are rising. You attribute this to volcanoes. Yet volcanoes only produce about 1% of the carbon produced by fossil fuel burning (2). Even if the rate of volcanic eruptions quintupled, this would still not explain the dramatic rise in atmospheric carbon. You also state that climate change is part of some 'natural cycle.' Yet contrary to your beliefs (and, I'll admit, some of my idle thoughts, until I read this article), climate change is definitely not part of the same cycle as the Ice Ages (3). For one thing, it's not happening during the correct alignment of Earth's axis; while we're definitely in a warm period, the temperature should be FALLING, not rising, since the peak of the warm period was a few thousand years ago. Even if climate change WAS caused by the Sun, the troposphere is getting warmer while the stratosphere and -spheres above cool, a fingerprint of greenhouse gas warming. The Sun would be heating all layers equally. That leaves volcanic and oceanic greenhouse gas releases as the only possible candidates - yet they are both tiny climate change contributors, as I explained earlier, and - get this - they actually release a different carbon isotope mix with a different molecular makeup. The oceanic and volcanic carbon has a lower ratio of carbon-12 to carbon-13 - so how do you explain that the ratio has been rising steadily?

    <t>You seem to be misunderstanding the question. Neither the question nor I ever said humans were 'THE cause' of climate change, but they are far and away the most destructive and sudden cause. Look at Graph 1. If, as you said, humans had no effect on climate change, how do you explain that extreme anomaly? While it certainly began at the peak of an Ice Age temperature/carbon cycle, the real production did not start until much later, and, as the graph shows, half the rise has been produced SINCE 1950. You ask me to explain how the climate spiked in the past - the answer is that it was a natural cycle, as you said. I NEVER claimed that all historical climate change was caused by humans. But this is an anomaly. Look at Source 2: Climate change now is 50 to 100 times faster than at any point in the past 65 million years. The biggest mistake climate skeptics make is to say that man-made climate change goes at anything like the pace of natural climate change: It does not. It's faster, so muchly-much faster that it's unattributable to volcanoes and oceans. Skeptics tend to say that atmospheric temperature can't rise as fast as scientists say it can, since the atmosphere is big, but it can. My point is that this is a different kind of cycle, far beyond anything since the dinosaurs went extinct.  I already explained how this cycle is different, actually. Look at my Source 4. Warming is more balanced in natural cycles. During the Ice Ages, Africa was heating up while Europe was being covered in ice. The planet can regulate its own temperature, but not in extreme circumstances, which we've now created. So the entire Earth is warming. Nothing has gotten colder, except once every twelve months when all the deniers come out of their houses and say their opinion is valid because there's snow on the ground. This change is fundamentally different from all before it. For the sake of our children and grandchildren, we need to act now.  </t>

    <t>Definitions:1. Cause: to make (something) happen or exist : to be the cause of (something)2. Climate: the average course or condition of the weather at a place usually over a period of years as exhibited by temperature, wind velocity, and precipitationHumans do indeed play a role in climate change, but they do not explicitly 'cause' climate change. Between the years of 900 and 1250, parts of the earth experienced a wide spread warming (Medieval Warm Period). This was before the existence of the Industrial Revolution, the invention of cars, and the widespread use of fossil fuels. Following this warm period, there was a cooling period. Millions of years ago, before humans roamed around, earth's climate had a drastic change. Carbon levels rose, and the earth heated up. A good number of organisms died. It's interesting to note that in both of these cases, humans were either completely absent or in a much lesser number than now. And yet, somehow, the earth was still warming up. Yes, carbon levels are rising. Yes, the earth has warmed up a bit within the past 50 years. Yes, the sea levels have risen. But can we really blame humans and human activity? Climate change does happen, but to say that it is 'caused' by human activity is quite a stretch.Even though the steady rise in carbon levels and sea levels can be loosely matched with the Industrial Revolution and the rise of humans, this is in no way definitive proof that humans cause climate change. Science has shown us many examples of climate change that did not directly involve humans.It's also important to understand that volcanoes have much to do with carbon levels and climate change. It's also interesting to note that many scientists believe that volcanic activity has had a slight increase over the past 50-60 years.</t>

    <t>While your arguments are certainly convincing, they still in no way prove that humans are the direct cause of climate change. If humans were 'the cause' of climate change, as you stated, all the past spikes in temperature would be marked by human activity, which, in fact, is not the case.As I said before, there could possibly be a correlation with the IR and the steady rise in temperatures. But is that enough to claim that humans are the cause? The issue under debate is not that humans play a significant part in climate change, it's that humans are the cause of climate change. Volcanoes and oceanic emissions make up a very small percentage when it comes to carbon emission, but the numbers are still there.How did the volcanic CO2 emissions measure up 300 years ago? 200 years ago? 100 years ago? Climate change has been a very long and drawn out event. It is not an overnight change. Volcano eruptions in the past did outweigh the emissions made by humans. Humans began producing and thriving at a much greater level, and now, human emissions outweigh volcanic eruptions. So how can we attest climate change to humans when hundreds of years ago (when the climate was still rising) volcanic activity outweighed human emissions? If humans cause climate change, please explain why the climate spiked in the past, even when humans were hardly making a significant impact on CO2 levels in the atmosphere.</t>

I see where you are coming from, however I have to respectfully disagree. It's also interesting to note that whenever the earth gets warmer, scientists immediately jump to climate change and global warming.

Rather, it is up to me to prove that it is real. I will have the responsibility of making the arguments. My opponent will not have any responsibility or obligation to make arguments.

If I prove that global warming is real and that it is primarily or totally anthropogenic, then I will have succeeded.

Please note that I am not arguing about whether global warming will rapidly increase in the future. I am only arguing about whether it exists today. Now, let's go back to data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs_v3/, which I referenced earlier. If you look at the graph that says 'Global Temperature (meteorological stations)', you can clearly see that the graph has a positive trend. It may not be increasing very rapidly, but remember that I am not arguing that global warming is increasing rapidly. I am merely arguing that it exists. My opponent also says, 'We don't need to close perfectly good coal plants, lay off thousands of people, starve Africa of electric power or pay drastically higher energy bills.' I am not arguing for any of those things. This is not a debate about possible solutions for global warming, but rather a debate about whether global warming exists.

Remember, this debate is solely about whether global warming is real - not about whether it will have terrible consequences or about how slow or fast it is.  And now, to make my own argument. Global warming is a fact. The global mean land-ocean temperature is much higher than it was in 1880, and overall, the trend has been that it has been increasing since then. It does decrease at times, which is inevitable. Temperatures rise and fall. But overall, the trend is that the global mean land-ocean temperature is increasing. The same can be said for the global temperature. Both of these can be verified by going to data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs_v3/.  I welcome my opponent to respond to my arguments.</t>

    <t>I will enumerate more of my opponents graphs.Figure 12: Global Glacier Cumulative Volume ChangesFigure 13: Proportions of growing and shrinking glaciers in 2009Figure 14: Sea Levels since 1870Figure 15: US Stations reporting continuously from 1900 to 2000Figure 16: Feedbacks vs Forcings GraphPart 6: Contradictory Glacial, Sea Level, and Temperature DataFigure 12 is interesting not because it counters any of my argument, but because it puts my opponents temperature, and sea level data in contradiction with it. If you look at 1970 in Figure 12 You'll notice the volume of glacial ice is higher than any point from 1870 to 1970. How did we get more Ice in 1970? If we accept that the melt of glaciers is caused solely by heat, and if we accept ether Figure 2, or the corrected Figure 6 then we have a problem. The dates leading up to 1970 don't show any noticeable decline in temperature that would explain it, and the Figure 14 sea levels don't show any stabilizing or drop in sea level to address where this extra water for the ice even came from.We're locked into another contradiction similar to the one that I started with. Ether the Glacial data is correct, and temperature, and sea level is incorrect. The Inverse of that, or both are wrong.There are a couple of issues with Figure 12 that will need to be disclosed and accounted for before we can con to a decision about which data is correct. According to my opponent's source the number of glaciers represented from 1946 on back is in the single digits. It's not until about 1960 that we have about 30 glaciers represented in the sample. If we take a look at Figure 10 we can see that this is the point where the yearly median drops below zero implying slightly colder than average temperatures.If you look at Figure 12 at 1980 you'll notice the angle of decrease shows a slowing which would imply that the temperature decreased, or had a slower accent than in prior years. In Figures 2, and 6 no such indication is given, but in Figure 10 the early 80's shows another decline in temperatures before the 90's where it finally moves above zero implying higher than normal temperatures, and thus a steeper decline in volume.In other words Figure 12 is in less contradiction with Figure 11 then it is with Figures 2, 6, and 14.However, Figure 12 also suffers from exaggeration of features due to changing sample size. This is address in my analysis in step 4, and when I brought up the causes of the differences between Figure 7 and Figure 8. Adding in a thousand weather stations radically altered the graph which is why step 4 restricted weather stations to existing at the start and end of the analysis. So where does the sampling look like for Glaciers? My opponent's source is very nice to graph it out for us to see on their intermediate discussion of glacial ice.Figure 17: Number of observed glaciersAs you can see just prior to 1976 there was only about 45 glaciers in the data. Then it spontaneously has about 20, nearly half of the prior sample, added in. This continues until the early 80's where that with a sample of just over 90 has doubled the sample. Then throw out the 90's regular sampling increased, and this would further exaggerate the changes because we hasn't sampled the glaciers in that method in the past.Now I'd love to download the generate the data properly myself. My opponents source does point people towards it here: wgms.ch/data_databaseversions/ However the data isn't high quality like the GHCN dataset, and would require more time than I have in this debate to properly process. It also doesn't have what I would consider a high enough quantity of data. It barely has 30 glaciers sampled regularly, and I'd personally prefer 100 before I started making definitive claims about what the data says. Even the source claims that they have 228 glaciers in the data, and the only way for that to work with the sample graph is if glaciers skip years, and aren't fully represented every year, and across every season in a year.Part 7: Hiatus Proof?My opponent is under the mistaken belief that I've proven the hiatus to be false. Unfortunately Part 1 of my argument does everything, but that. I've proven only that two parts of the global warming argument about the hiatus are in stark contradiction with each other. That only proves one, or both are wrong. Unfortunately it doesn't prove which one is actually wrong. Parts 2, 3, and 4 are the evidence that undermines Figures 2, and 6 strongly suggesting that data in both cases is flawed. It's up you the judges to choose which you believe. However, using my opponent's reasoning that “because more recent updates are and should be seen as more trustworthy” is counter to logic, reason, and debate. It is an appeal to the authority of newness, and not a rational reason at all.Part 8: Correlation vs CausationMy opponent seems to be under the impression that my only focuses on the temperatures, and doesn't refute humans as the cause. There is a phrase in statistics that you may have heard. “Correlation does not imply causation”, but that's only half the phrase. These other half is, “There is no causation without correlation”. Simply put if there is no correlation between global warming and human activity as Figure 10 shows then humans are certainly not the cause. However, if you believe Figure 2, or 6, and that they correlate to human CO2 activity then there is the additional burden of proving that the correlation causal, and not just correlational.It's an unfortunate asymmetry in statistical arguments. There is a possibility that even if there isn't a correlation that maybe the correlation is just smaller than can be measured with the available data, but that would yield that human activity is an insignificant factor in global warming.As for correlation issues my opponent has another problem. If we believe Figure 14 we'd expect out CO2 emissions to map over it, and show a visible correlation. Now both CO2, and Ocean levels have gone up over time, but just going up isn't enough. Sea levels have a nice smooth mathematical curve built into it. I'd have loved to have put both the CO2 and Figure 14 together, but my opponents source linking to the data to do that leads to a 404 error. CO2 EmissionsIf you notice between 1950 and 200 there is a bulge in out CO2 emissions, and between 1980 and 2000 a different rate of increase until 2000 where it is in line with an exponential trend that started in 1870. These features would be expected in the Sea Levels data if they were strongly correlated, but it looks like by the seal levels that it's an exponential trend that never varies in the way out CO2 emissions do. My data is courtesy of Source 8. Now if my opponent can find the source for this Figure I'd be happy to merge the sea level in so we can see just how much it doesn't correlate. Most other sources only give about 10 years of data.Part 9: Solar ActivityMy opponent is under the impression that he can wave his hands, and assert an argument, and data is null just because it doesn't conform to his world view. He'd have to explain the lack of movement in the past data, and give an appropriate alternative for Cycle 24 correlating, but not prior. NASA's assessment in 2008 on the effect of Solar Storms due to this unprecedented phenomenon had no prior data. Outside of the last decade this was never observed before. Claiming that we should see all layers heat up as he claims to try to ‘nullify' is nothing more than an unsupported assumption.Part 10: Dust BowlMy opponent makes the claim that I hadn't explained the downward change in the median, and then attempted to assert that it must be from a change in methodology. Though I'm not against this possibility claiming that a change in any of the graphs is due to a methodology change requires further explanation. Parts 2, 3, and 4 are extensive explanation of methodological errors. However, I did explain the change in the graph even if it was indirect. In the 1930's there was a excessive drought, and heat waves. Part of this being clearly represented in the data is due to the United States having the best most consistent weather station data for the last century, and even more so in my opponent's Figure 15 because it is only the United States of America 600 weather stations vs my sample of 1170 weather stations. Now this event very much did occur, and is verified in the EPA Heat Wave Index that shows the 30's were exceedingly bad even by today's standards, and you can read source 5 to see further analysis on this Great Depression causing event if you doubt the 30's heat waves weren't hell on Earth.Now why the 30's was Hell on Earth is anybody's guess. We know it was bad, and man made CO2 emissions were even lower so blaming them enters into contradiction with the present high emissions. Personally I'd love it if there was enough pan evaporation data to verify that there was, or was not a correlation with sunspots, but the available GHCN data is too small for that period evaporation data.Part 11: Contention 4My opponents 4th contention appears to be missing an actual argument to go with it, or even a time period to show the change in forcing, and feedbacks over time. Perhaps he will clarify in the next round what he was going after with it.Part 12: Earth, Mars, and VenusI'm out of time, and characters so I will have to cut my response a bit, and hope to come back to this part if possible.I await my opponent.</t>

    <t>Resolved: Human Activity Is a Significant Factor in Global Warming on Planet Earth.I don't intend on reposting any of my opponents graphs, or data. However it is important that I enumerate his graphs.Figure 1: Atmospheric CO2 for 650,000 yearsFigure 2: Global Land-Ocean Temperature IndexFigure 3: Greenhouse ExplanationFigure 4: Average Monthly Arctic Sea Ice August 1979 to 2013Figure 5: Sea Level ChangePart 1: DoubtIt's telling that my opponent makes the claim that it is irrefutable, and then uses Figure 2. Even NASA, and NOAA would refute that graph since in June of this year they published serious corrections in an attempt to remove the hiatus from the argument.Figure 6: Corrected Figure 2Now this claim that the pause doesn't exist poses a problem because a few years ago the claim was that the pause was caused by about 17 volcanoes back as little as 2014[2]. So which is it? Does the pause exist, and was caused by Volcanoes, or does the pause not exist, and was caused by weighting issues in the data? Any reasonable person should now have some doubt in the basic data claims of global warming for a basic contradiction.Part 2: Methodology BiasUnderstanding instrument, and methodology bias is needed to understand what was done in Figure 6, and understand if we should accept the graph at all.The data that is being corrected is the Ocean temperature measurements done by volunteer ships in the early half of the data. By itself this isn't a problem. The ship data has a higher inaccuracy, but all the ship data would have similar errors, and when compared to the same methodology there wouldn't be an issue. When you mix in other methodologies this error can become a big problem. What caused these differences isn't hard to understand. Think of a time where we collected temperature data without the aid of a machine. If someone has to go out, and check the temperature, and record it there is always the possibility they missed the true high, and missed the true low. When we get to machine aided recording missing that true high, and true low is drastically reduced. Furthermore the error is unidirectional. Missing the true high will only result in a lower value. Just as missing the true low only results in a higher value.We can actually see this type of bias in weather station dataset call the GHCN Data: [3]If we didn't accept the methodology bias Figure 7 would present an interesting problem since the average high increase about 4 degrees C, and the average Low decreases by about 6 degrees C. If that was global warming the decrease in the low would seriously outweigh the increase in the high.Figure 7: All GHCN High and Low Temperature Yearly AveragesPart 3: Addressing BiasTo address bias the bias must remain as constant as possible. Part of the reason for only debating the last 115 years is that the bias for weather station methodology hasn't radically changed unlike in the seventeen, and eighteen hundreds where changes in methodology were much more common. By just comparing a station to itself, and only looking at the stations delta from hits own average we can show that the abrupt change around 1900 was actually an illusion caused by a large number of stations following a similar methodology, and not an actual change in temperature.We can see in Figure 8 that the change is more gradual like the low temperature in Figure 7. The disagreement between the two graphs implies that the change is due to method changes, and not due to real changes.Figure 8: All GHCN Station High Temperature Average DeltaFigure 9: All GHCN Station Low Temperature Average DeltaIt would be an error to accept either Figure 7 or 8 as the truth. Both still suffer from a change in methodology bias, but they reflect that change differently. They both also high the noise in the data by utilizing a yearly, and 5 year mean. However, if you do accept Figure 7 as the truth you'd still have to reconcile the issue that Figure 9 shows that the Low temperature being higher than our modern time.We also have an issue with sample size. At the earliest part of the data there is only 1 station. It's not until the 1870's that we start to get a decent sample size to start to remove statistical sampling errors, but even then it's only at a minimum. At the peak of the data in 2005 we have nearly 14 thousand station, but by 2015 we only have 10 thousand stations. This radical change in sample size can cause. Just as in 1893 we only had 563 stations but in 1894 we had 1353 which is responsible for the abrupt change in Figure 7.The methodology below is what I will use to address each of these issues.Methodology GHCN Data Analysis: 1. To process this data the first step is to convert each stations monthly 31 day values into a single monthly median value for each station.2. Then each stations monthly median values are averages to create the average median for the life of the station.3. The station average median is then subtracted from the station median to create a delta that represents that stations change away from the average median.4. Stations are then selected based on the date of operation. For analysis starting in 1900 all weather stations that were operational in 1900 and operational at the end of the analysis must be used. Weather stations that were not operational at the start of the analysis cannot be used because they will induce a change in the region bias.5. From there the data can be graphed, or each months delta for the year can be averaged to create a yearly change for a simpler graph.Part 4: GHCN Data AnalysisFigure 10 below is the above analysis applied to the Global Historical Climatology Network Data. The blue dots represent the monthly noise that Figure 2, and 6 hides. We can now see that the average temperature varies by +- 4 degrees from normal, and not the few tenths of a degree that the yearly mean implies. As a note the two largest positive deviations from the mean are March 2010, and 2012 by 6.1, and 6.6 degrees respectively. They are separated by nearly a century, and show that the high temperatures of 2012 are hardly abnormal.If you notice in the graph between 1930, and 1940 you'll notice a clear bulge in the 5 year mean about zero. This is of note because it correlates with the known heat waves of the 30's that attributed to an climaxed with the Dust Bowl in 1936 as seen in the EPA Heat Wave Index[5]. Anyone looking at this data in the 50's and 60's might actually believe that we were heading towards a global cooling event since in the 70's the median clearly drops below zero. Conversely anyone starting their analysis in the 70's is starting at a low, and thus only see a movement upwards. Which may also explain my opponent's Figures 4 and 5 which start with the low 70's era, and lack any data for the early half of the 115 year period this debate is over.We can even apply a trend line to see if there is a trend upwards over the time period. There is a slight trend of 0.0009 degrees celsius per year, but this is with an R Squared of 0.0004 which means the significance of that upward trend is almost nothing, and can't be used for any real future predictions. For those unfamiliar with R Squared we really want to see a value as close to 1 as possible. A value of 0.5 is ok for some things like predicting erratic human behavior, but the more significant the claim the closer to 1 it needs to be. 0.0004 is so close to zero that it may as well be zero.Figure 10: GHCN High Monthly Average Delta 1900 - 2015I'd present A figure on the Low, but it would be redundant with Figure 10, and given the time and text constraints I will cut it from my argument.Part 5: Is Temperature the Appropriate Measure?When we say that CO2 causes the Earth's temperature to rise what we really mean is that the increase in CO2 causes the atmosphere to hold more energy. The Pan Evaporation Rate can be used to measure the energy in the atmosphere. If you take a look at Figure 11 you'll notice it significantly deviates from a rather consistent trend. I've reduced the time range to 1980 to 2015 to give the largest possible sample of 156 pans in the GHCN dataset.Figure 11: Pan Evaporation to Sun SpotsIf we accept the increase is due to an abnormal warming due to solar storms that track with sun spots then we have a problem from the lack of any significant change during the man made ramp up of CO2 over the last 3, and a half decades. Since the sun's solar output varies by about 0.1 percent[6] it could be that even adding more CO2 has little effect because we've long since been able to absorb nearly all of the available solar energy.So why is there a spontaneous increase after 2005? In 2008 NASA announced a discovery of an odd phenomena. They observed a Northern polarity Coronal Mass Ejection rip open our Northern Magnetic pole, and thus exposed the entire day side of the planet to solar storms that it doesn't normally get[7]. This resulted in the prediction that solar cycle 24 which would send more northern polarity CME's towards the Earth would, and subject us to an unusually high volume of Solar Storms that our Magnetic field usually protects us from. This would also explain why the shape with many of the same peaks and valleys visible in the data.</t>

    <t>Thanks to my opponent, it's been fun.I will respond to the points my opponent has made in this round, and clarify my case.But first of all, I am sure that I hadn't ignored a piece of my opponent's case. Don't trust this claim as just because a response is brief doesn't mean it's not valid.==Rebuttal 1: 1970 has more ice than 1870==My opponent is correct that the data is cumulative. However, he drops my response to this when I stated that there was an apparent but brief drop in temperature caused by sulphate aerosols. I don't agree with how my opponent states I must drop the evidence simply because his basis is that there was an increase in ice for 20 years (even though the line starts dropping rapidly). If we were to apply a trend line the line would most definitely be slanted downwards towards the right. His argument doesn't explain the rest of the graph showing sharp declines in ice. I find that my opponent nitpicks at every little flaw that doesn't seem right even though the rest supports my argument, and he ends up dropping the rest of the graph altogether.I think what my opponent focuses the most on, however, is how figures are exaggerated as more and more climate stations are set up, and he attempts to apply that to temperature record figures. However, the notion that temperature record figures are untrustworthy is false, as has been shown throughout the debate [1]:'For example, a study by Anderson et al. (2012) created a new global surface temperature record reconstruction using 173 records with some type of physical or biological link toglobal surface temperatures (corals, ice cores, speleothems, lake and ocean sediments, and historical documents).  The study compared their reconstruction to the instrumental temperature record and found a strong correlation between the two[.]' - Skeptical Science [1]==Rebuttal 2: No correlation==This point as a large relation with the first point, and doesn't affect much in the debate. Basically my opponent states that we can't trust graphs that start in the 70's because it was a low point in global warming. There are two points to make:(A) Again, my opponent doesn't focus on the rest of the graphs with clearly agree with my case in the debate.(B) The only figures I gave which started in the 70's are the ones I had replaced with other data.Again, this point is null because it has little to no weight in this debate.==Rebuttal 3: Pan Evaporation==My opponent drops my response to this argument, where I gave the two statements that (a) we cannot use the method because no sources or figures measuring temperature correlate with pan evaporation, and (b) global warming is found to be affected by human causes the most, as shown in the last round.After doing some research, I found that pan evaporation did have to do with climate, but not with global warming. This extends the point of my rebuttal [2]:'Pan evaporation is a measurement that combines or integrates the effects of several climate elements: temperature, humidity, rain fall, drought dispersion, solar radiation, and wind. Evaporation is greatest on hot, windy, dry, sunny days; and is greatly reduced when clouds block the sun and when air is cool, calm, and humid. Pan evaporation measurements enable farmers and ranchers to understand how much water their crops will need.' - Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopediia [2]Wikipedia states that pan evaporation helps farmers and ranchers to correctly water their crops. But never does it say anything about energy in the atmosphere.==Counter 1: Sea Levels==My opponent seems to make a valid point about the glaical and ice contradiction, but it isn't valid. Glaciers hold less than 2% of the water on Earth [3]:'The amount of water locked up in ice and snow is only about 1.7 percent of all water on Earth[.]' - Textile Waste Diversion Inc. [3]Glaciers were just a part of my argument to show that ice was melting. The fact that glaciers hold so little of the world's water barely makes any difference in the rise in sea levels, especially since most glaciers exist inland, but not near the oceans, as most glaciers are of the Himalayas, which are inland [4][5]: 'The Himalayan–Karakoram (HK) region has among the largest glacier coverage outside the polar regions[.]' - Estimating the volume of glaciers in the Himalayan–Karakoram region using different methods [5]This alone means that glaciers can be used as evidence for global warming, but NOT to disprove its existence. My opponent's rebuttal is null.==Counter 2: Mixed Methodologies==This, again, is an example of the nitpicking my opponent has done throughout the debate. Correlation =/= imitation. But if my opponent still can't accept my graph, here are the reasons why my opponent's rebuttal isn't coherent:1. My opponent emphasized a lot on the heat waves of the 30's, so the fact that he's using that to try and prove there isn't a correlation is beyond me.2. Where the temperature drops out (more so not) of the correlation is so insignificant that it may as well be part of the correlation. Somehow my opponent thinks that a difference in correlation about a millimeter or less for a graph THAT size still counts as proof that the correlation is false.==Counter 3: Other planets=='When we burn Coal we actually end up taking O2 out of the air, and put in CO2.' - OpponentMy opponent now suddenly agrees that CO2 has a heating effect, which is different from the last few contentions. But if this is untrue, see my previous counter.My opponent also agrees that we are still adding CO2 to the atmosphere, even though oxygen is being taken out of the air. It's basically a concession of this point because my opponent agrees the atmosphere on Venus is thick with greenhous gases. P1) More CO2 in the atmosphere = Earth heats upP2) We are putting more CO2 into the atmosphereC) We are heating up Earth.As for the electromagnetic field, my opponent ignores that Mercury does not have a major electromagnetic field either [6].'Mercury’s magnetic field is 150 times weaker than that of our planet, however.' - Phys.org [6] And with a distance much smaller from the sun than other planets, you'd expect that Mercury would be hotter. However, BECAUSE Venus has such an atmosphere it is simply that much hotter.==Dropped arguments==My opponent drops many arguments in the debate, which is lucky because they seem to be important points.He drops the points:- That natural causes have a much smaller heating effect than with human effects- That positive feedbacks amplify heating effects- That the increase in glaciers is probably due to the brief drops in temperature that were only temporary and caused by humans as well- That methodology changes don't change the actual temperature- That we can't use pan evaporation because it is not relevant to the debate- That temperatures are perfectly fine evidence in terms of this debate- That the corrections made in NASA's graph do not make much difference- That newer sources are usually more trustworthy, especially when made by a government websiteThose are the ones that I can think of at the top of my head, and there could be more. Don't let my opponent respond to them because it is unfair if he responds when I can't.==Conclusion== There are huge holes in my opponent's argument, as well as big contradictions. Their arguments are more like theories (or even just hypotheses) because they nitpick at things if something isn't perfect. And my opponent can throw any theory he wants at me but scientific research somehow, as tylergraham said, always seems to fly in his face.The resolution is soundly affirmed.</t>
<h>    Thanks to my opponent, it's been fun.I will respond to the points my opponent has made in this round, and clarify my case.But first of all, I am sure that I hadn't ignored a piece of my opponent's case.</h>

    <t>Thank you, medv4380.   ==Contention 1: The correlation between increase in Carbon Dioxide and global temperature==  Throughout the last 650,000 years, there have been seven cycles of glacial advances and retreats, where the carbon dioxide levels abruptly increased, then gradually decreased afterward. However, in 1950, Co2 levels were at a critical level and kept on rising. As of 2014, the global Co2 levels were at an all time high of nearly 400 parts per million [1]:    2 has increased since the Industrial Revolution. (Source: [[LINK     As we can see above, in the last 650,000 years, the Co2 levels have never grown above 300 ppm, as opposed to now, where the Co2 levels are at 400 ppm. Obviously, this abrupt growth in Co2 levels are caused by human activity, such as mass production, the use of electricity, polluting, etc.  I have provided a youtube video above to show the correlation between the high Co2 levels and global temperature [2]. When both are compared, this becomes irrefutable evidence that man-made global warming exists. Note that this is all over the world, so accusations of choosing a specific area for evidence cannot be valid.  In fact, as of 2013, the average global temperature was 14.6 degrees Celsius (58.3 degrees Fahrenheit), which is 0.8 degrees Celsius (1.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than when the year was 1880, and 0.6 degrees Celsius (1.1 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the mid-20th century baseline [3][4][5]:    Already, on the first contention, we have seen major evidence affirming the resolution.  ==Contention 2: The cause and effect of the Greenhouse Effect and what makes it more powerful==  The greenhouse effect on Planet Earth has been occurring for almost its whole life and is a natural phenomenon, since greenhouse gases such as Co2 have existed on Earth from its birth, thus heating the Earth to help sustain forms of life [6]:  'To its credit, the greenhouse effect has been around long before humans began to burn fossil fuels, and it is a natural phenomenon in that makes life habitable for all living things.' [6]  The greenhouse effect operates when the sun's heat passes through Earth's atmosphere, heats the Earth's surface and is reflected back upward. Most of this heat is absorbed by the greenhouse gases like water vapor, Co2 and methane. Afterward, the heat is re-emited in all directions, thus starting the cycle again, continuously heating the Earth. Greenhouse gases literally act like a thermal blanket for Earth [7]:  of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide – act as a thermal blanket for the Earth, absorbing heat and warming the surface to a life-supporting average of 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius).' /gt;  'A layer of greenhouse gases - primarily water vapor, and including much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide - act as a thermal blanket for the Earth, absorbing heat and warming the surface to a life-supporting average of 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius).' [7]  From this information, we can conclude that the more greenhouse gases are put into the atmosphere, the more heat from the sun is absorbed, thus creating a powerful greenhouse effect. Human actvity is causing this to happen.  P1) The more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the more powerful the greenhouse effectP2) Human activity is emitting more greenhouse gases into the atmosphereC) Human activity is the cause of a more powerful greenhouse effect, and thus man-made global warming exists.  To further prove this point, let us inspect Earth's neighboring planets, Mars and Venus.  Mars' atmosphere is quite thin, and it's nearly completely made up of Co2. However, it is because of the low atmospheric pressure and lack of other greenhouse gases that the greenhouse effect is not at all strong and thus Mars has a frozen surface without any signs of organisms [7].  'Not enough greenhouse effect: The planet Mars has a very thin atmosphere, nearly all carbon dioxide. Because of the low atmospheric pressure, and with little to no methane or water vapor to reinforce the weak greenhouse effect, Mars has a largely frozen surface that shows no evidence of life.' [7]  Now, let us inspect Venus.  Despite Venus' atmosphere also being almost entirely carbon dioxide, the amount of Co2 Venus contains is about 300 times as much as Mars' or Earth's. This creates a HUGELY powerful greenhouse effect, causing a temperature so high that lead could not stay solid. [7]  'Too much greenhouse effect: The atmosphere of Venus, like Mars, is nearly all carbon dioxide. But Venus has about 300 times as much carbon dioxide in its atmosphere as Earth and Mars do, producing a runaway greenhouse effect and a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead.' [7]  This can be further proven by checking Mercury's temperature compared to Venus' temperature, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun than Venus. [8]   'Venus has a very dense atmosphere made up of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and sulfuric acid, while Mercury has a very thin atmosphere with various gases, but very little carbon dioxide.' [8]  Again this information is major evidence of the existence of man-made global warming.  ==Contention 3: Arctic Ice and Sea Levels==  It is widely agreed that melting ice from the Arctic and Antarctic and sea level rise is a sign of increasing temperatures. If I can prove that ice is definitely decreasing and that sea levels are definitely rising, then I win this contention.  Here is a chart showing definite decrease in Arctic ice [9]:    Here is another chart showing rising sea levels [10]:    Also, recent reports state that the Arctic is losing ice three times as fast as the Antarctic is gaining ice [11][12].   'Sea ice surrounding Antarctica reached a new record high extent this year, covering more of the southern oceans than it has since scientists began a long-term satellite record to map sea ice extent in the late 1970s. The upward trend in the Antarctic, however, is only about a third of the magnitude of the rapid loss of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean.'  Thus, I affirm this contention.  ==Conclusion==  I have put forward major evidence and arguments proving the existence of man-made global warming. I have also put out evidence that the greenhouse effect does indeed exist.  Thus, the resolution is affirmed.</t>

    <t>Thanks to my opponent! Reading their arguments I can see this will be a great debate! I'd like to remind my opponent that although this is a rebuttal round, per the rules, new arguments can still be made.Also, there was a problem with my sources in the previous round. Rebuttal 1: To doubt =/= To refute==My opponent's first argument poses a few flaws. First of all, the new figure that has been presented has *barely changed* looking at the more recent years of the graph. Also, the change at the start of the graph is a difference of what seems to be less than 0.2 degrees Celcius, which doesn't even change the fact that the warming is significant. But that isn't the point. The point is the question of what to trust. 'Now this claim that the pause doesn't exist poses a problem because a few years ago the claim was that the pause was caused by about 17 volcanoes back as little as 2014. So which is it? Does the pause exist, and was caused by Volcanoes, or does the pause not exist, and was caused by weighting issues in the data? Any reasonable person should now have some doubt in the basic data claims of global warming for a basic contradiction.' - My opponentWhile I can agree that this may pose doubt, I can also ask the audience to *turn* this argument, because more recent updates are and should be seen as more trustworthy, no matter how close they are. Therefore, my opponent's argument here only proves that there was no hiatus and the doubt should be cast on the 2014 update.Finally, I will stress this as much as I can: *This doesn't refute the notion that humans are a significant cause of global warming, because so far it only focuses on temperatures instead of causation.*==Rebuttal 2: Methodology Bias==There is no doubt that methodologies change throughout the course of time, as we advance with new technology. However, shouldn't it be safer to trust more modern methods rather than outdated ones? A lot of my opponent's part 2, 3 and 4 arguments are based solely off the fact that methodologies change, rather than addressing the fact that new methodologies can be used to update old figures, as was done with NASA's figure.Another version of figure 6 in my opponent's round can be seen here [1]:s://www.ncdc.noaa.gov...; alt='Graph showing no slow down in global warming' /gt;What really matters is what my opponent says about his GHCN analysis of the high monthly average delta graph. He claims that the cooling period might explain why figures 4 and 5 start at a certain point. But there wasn't any major increase trend in ice even before the 70's [2]:'Globally glaciers are losing ice at an extensive rate (Figure 1). There are still situations in which glaciers gain or lose ice more than typical for one region or another but the long term trends are all the same, and about 90% of glaciers are shrinking worldwide (Figure 2).' - Skeptical Science [2]Sea levels have also been rising since the 1800's [3]:'A variety of different measurements find steadily rising sea levels over the past century.' - Skeptical Science [3] The most important part is where my opponent claims that the trend is almost nothing and can't be used for future predictions. This graph closely resembles the one found here [4]:This figure was created from the actual temperature rise graphs from choosing the most actively reporting stations.  Unfortunately, my opponent never gives a reason as to why there was a cooling in 1945 - 1970. The reason to this is actually one of my opponent's arguments: methodologies changed right at that time. This would imply that graphed temperatures rapidly changed, and in this case, dropped. [5]Not only that, but the cooling was actually due to sulphate aerosols being released into the atmosphere [5]. Sulphate aerosols reflect solar energy back into space. This was not only caused by humans releasing such aerosols, but also by volcanic eruptions [5]. The greenhouse effect would start dominating climate again in the 70s, and the rapid warming has continued until today [5]. Therefore, rather than arguing we are not a cause of either, we should be discussing that we are the cause of both, and that the cooling was just a temporary decline.==Rebuttal 3: Is The Cause Solar Output?==The crux of my opponent's argument here is that pan evaporation correlates more with solar activity, and that the sudden increase would be because of a rip in the Northern Pole, weaking the Earth's magnetic field. We both agree that the sun's activity has remained quite constant in recent history. However, if the sudden warming were due to this rip, we can logically conclude that the atmosphere would be warmer within all layers as would happen with a situation where the sun actually increased in activity [6]. However, we have actually seen 'a cooling in the upper atmosphere, and a warming at the surface and in the lower parts of the atmosphere. That's because greenhouse gasses are trapping heat in the lower atmosphere.' - NASA [6]Therefore, my opponent's arguments are null.New contentions ==Contention 4: Positive feedbacks strengthen forcings==Forcings are factors that 'force' climate to change. Feedbacks are factors that amplify or diminish the effect of forcings. Because positive feedbacks dominate climate, the effect of forcings are significantly amplified [7]:==Conclusion==The evidence I have put out proves my opponent's arguments null and even contradicting as some of his data does not consider other factors. Therefore, so far a conclusion can be made that human effects do play a big part in global warming. </t>

    <t>Thanks to my opponent for such a great debate!Counter-rebuttals==Counter 1: Contradiction?==My opponent asserts that my glacial, sea level and temperature figures are contradictory. He never considers the fact that there were sudden but brief drops in temperature near to the increase in ice, which both his and my figures agree upon.I don't agree with the way my opponent presents why the amount of ice on Earth is increasing. More glaciers =/= more ice. Simply because there are more glaciers being observed doesn't mean the *amount* of ice is increasing. Don't count on trusting the use of his graph, because it is in a way irrelevant to what we are trying to discuss on this contention.==Counter 2: Hiatus==[Remember: The hiatus is said to have happened in more recent years, so more recent data can be cited.] Con tries to save his argument by stating that I made an appeal to authority to newness, and assumes that it is 'not a rational reason at all'. So what is he implying here? Is he implying that we should trust older methodologies simply because I supposedly committed one logical fallacy that isn't even that much of a negative effect? So far, that's the only basis he has for his argument, and the reason why we can't accept his basis in this case is because it is simply common sense. In most, if not all debates, we are inclined to use the newest and most updated sources, thus more trustworthy sources. We shouldn't try to attack the sources of others simply because it is 'an appeal to the authority of newness', because it isn't - it's just common sense.Where his argument is relevant is interesting, because he seems to not know which one is right or wrong. Even so, the graphs would *still* support my argument. Con doesn't even know if either of them ACTUALLY ARE right or wrong. And with the huge consensus and observed evidence supporting it, the answer leans way towards the Pro stance [1-3]: ==Counter 3: Correlation vs. Causation==Here my opponent essentially nitpicks the slightest flaws in correlation and claims these flaws are deciding factors. First of all, there isn't even supposed to be a direct correlation between CO2 and sea levels - they are FAR from correlating to each other. The CO2 is emitted, then temperature rises, then ice melts, THEN sea levels rise. You can't expect a perfect correlation when they are that far away from each other. Secondly, why must it correlate so perfectly? If they correlate and they are reasonably close, then what does it matter?==Counter 4: Solar Activity==I am shocked that my opponent has assumed that I made an unsupported assumption, *when it is undeniably clear I made a citation supporting my argument.* Let me repeat that. Clearly.And why would we need data from prior to the alleged increase when this is simply logic and facts? The reasoning I had given *perfectly* fits with the scenario being discussed. But if my opponent still isn't happy about that, then I'll explain why it is still null. The warming on Earth is known as global warming. Warming means steady temperature increase. Key word: temperature. So if temperature increasing means pan evapoation is increasing, then why is temperature almost universally agreed to be increasing yet there seems to be no trend in figure 11 for pan evaporation? Obviously this doesn't make sense. So is that figure very trustworthy? The answer: probably not.Also, just to top it off, figures agree that the increase is solely due to human effects [4]: ==Counter 5: Dust Bowl==My opponent continues to not give me a valid reason for the decrease in the median. Of course, he did talk about the droughts and terrible heat waves, but since when did we find out that the aftermath of heat waves would be sudden and big cooling worldwide?And yes, Con did provide extensive explanations about methodological bias, but that wasn't the only thing that caused figures to show a sudden cooling. The other thing was the fact that humans started to use more sulphate aerosols, which cool the Earth [5]. So Con has yet to come up with another reason for the decrease.==Counter 6: Feedbacks and forcings==I apologize for this contention - somehow it got cut out. I will not present the previous graphs, but rather build onto it.So far, we can conclude that positive feedbacks dominate climate and thus amplify the effect of forcings significantly. Climate sensitivity is essential in climate science - it is the rise of equilibrium global land-sea mean temperature each time CO2 concentration is doubled [6]. 'It is defined simply as the global mean warming that is reached in equilibrium (that is, after a long time) after doubling the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.' - Anthropogenic Climate Change: Revisiting the facts [6]With feedbacks, climate sensitivity is about 3 degrees Celcius [7]:The increasing CO2 emissions are predominantly anthropogenic. Combine the forcings increase with the feedback amplification, and you get increasing temperature caused by humans.My opponent seems to not be able to respond to the planets contention, so I will allow them to respond in their next arguments.==Conclusion==Con fails to disprove the evidence I have put forward, making assumptions that are difficult, if not impossible to justify. Thus, I affirm.I await my opponent's arguments!</t>

    <t>You the judges are presented with a problem. Whose statistics, whose figures should you believe?In order to help you I'm going to tell you a short story paraphrased from Professor Helen M Walker that you can find in a book titled “How to lie with Statistics” by Darrell Huff published in 1954 starting on about page 62. If you wish to debate any statistic, or figure you might want to consider reading the book in full.As women get older they toe out more as they walk. It seems like an absurd conclusion, and indeed false, but it is something the data would say at the time. To reach this conclusion you simply survey a large sample of women, and plot their age and angle of their feet, and it would say that at the time. Women who were younger didn't toe out as much as women who were older. However, it is wrong because it's assuming the younger women are a valid reconstructed past of the older women. The issue is actually that the older women toed out more even when they were younger as well because it was a generational fad that faded over time with each generation. The correct way to do this analysis would be to take women born at around the same time like 1900, and measure them once each year over a period of time like 115 years. Only then would you be able to tell if women toe out more as they grow older.This highlights the major problem with global warming data. It assumes that adding in a large volume of weather stations at different periods of time that have no past to compare to won't cause any deviation in their data. It assumed that adding in data from volunteer ships for the first half of the century, but not the later half wouldn't affect their data until adjusting it in a favorable way appeared to remove part of the argument.If we had no choice I'd agree that this method is flawed, but there exists no alternative. However, we have a sufficiently large number of weather stations that have been in operation from 1900 to Present. But this basic analysis for checking to see if sampling bias, and methodology bias is the actual cause of the change is ignored. There exists no funding of additional projects that says there is no measurable change in temperature in the last 115 years. There is no renewal of tenure for the professor who can only publish once that there is nothing here on a subject, and then must find another controversy to publish on.As for the Hiatus, if you understand my argument at this point you should have a clue as to what it actually is. Over the years we've added so many weather stations that by the mid 90's that ability to manipulate the data by adding more sample would require adding 5 to 10 thousand samples. They'd finally reached the point where the law of large numbers overwhelmed them, and adding a few hundred only accounted for a few percentage points to the total sample. The cost of adding non randomized weather station sample exceeded their desire.The evaporation data by itself is all that is needed to prove man is not a significant player in global warming. The rest is ether to confirm the finding like how stable evaporation had been prior to 2005, and 2010. Or to discredit, and confront the poor methods used to support my opponent's argument.If the evaporation data couldn't show changes in the Earth's Atmospheric energy then it would remain flat regardless of any change in the environment. However, we know it does change, and changed with the predictions from NASA that the Earth would be subjected to more solar storms than we normally do for Solar Cycle 24 due to an unexpected effect in our electromagnetic field. The correlation is so pristine that it even has the same peaks and valleys. If it can change for that in such a fine tuned way then why doesn't it so the change for man caused global warming? There are only two answers. Either man caused global warming is insignificant compared to the solar effect, and is drowned out by the subtle noise. Or that it is nonexistent. Ether conclusion fully supports my argument.I've undermined, and instilled doubt into my opponent's argument. That isn't to get you to vote for me. That is only to give you a reason to listen so that I can give you the time of day. You will vote for me because you will have looked at the evaporation data I've presented, and come to the same rational conclusion.Man Made Global Warming has nothing to do with the enhanced levels of energy in our atmosphere over the last decade, and is insignificant, or nonexistent compared to the natural cause: Solar Storms breaking through our Electromagnetic Field.Thank you for letting me give you the time of day.</t>

<h>Contention 1: CO2 and Temperatures. First, let's bring up just how much these accused compounds exactly warm the Earth's atmosphere. CO2 for example has the global warming potential of 1. Here are the other numbers. Carbon Dioxide -- 1Methane -- 21Nitrous Oxide -- 298-310CFC's -- VariousWater Vapor -- 0.25 [1]  Now, I just want you to keep this in mind for this next part here. We may observe that humans release approximately 35 gigatons of CO2 a year. [2] This is only 4.3% of the total amount of all Global Warming Gasses, however it is incrediably small when it comes to comparing the rest of the Global Warming gasses. If we observe the chart bellow we can see that Water Vapor is a large Contributor to Global Warming at 95% and CO2 comes in second. But here's the kicker. If we look at the Human contributed part that I'm about to post in the graph bellow we can see that it's very miniscule of 0.117% of all total Warming gasses. Now let's do some quick math here. CO2's increase was from what my opponent is claiming is from 295 ppm to 400ppm, a total of only 105 ppm. 1 Gigaton of CO2 is the equilivent of 2.13 ppm. [3] This means that increase of 105 ppm means a total of 49.29 gigatons. Since 1 gigaton of CO2 is the equivilance of .004% of the Greenhouse effect that means that 49.29 gigatons means an aditional .21% increase to Global Warming. This would account for a grand total of a 0.15 F increase in global temperature. This is a very measly amount and we can see that with my opponent's claims a simple 0.15 F increase isn't enough to melt glacers and have the effeccts that he is speaking of and it proves that this is NAUTRAL not man-made to fulfil his effects if they were real.     The above graph shows that comparisions of C13 (Carbon isotope) and this shows that there is little to no trend pertrade in many of these as the average is zero while the trend for all of these are zero. [4] This is important as the Carbon isotope is important in measuring this so called 'Global Warming.'   Let us observe the above graph. Here I would like to point out the that the increase from Pre-Inustrial to Industrial era and the doubling of the CO2 leveling lead to a decrease in it's temperature. Also we can see that the 10 mile 'hot-spot' above the tropics is actually absent. 'The computer models show that greenhouse warming will cause a hot-spot at an altitude between 8 and 12 km over the tropics between 30 N and 30 S. The temperature at this hot-spot is projected to increase at a rate of two to three times faster than at the surface. However, the Hadley Centre's real-world plot of radiosonde temperature observations shown below does not show the projected CO2 induced global warming hot-spot at all. The predicted hot-spot is entirely absent from the observational record. This shows that atmosphere warming theory programmed into climate models are wrong.' [5]Now if we observe the above graph of the past 400,000 yeasrs we can see that the CO2 rates in our atmosphere has flutated the exact same way in this cycle both before and during the existance of human beings. We can see that the temperatures and CO2 levels have been going up and down randomly for the past 100 thousands years and it is observed that this occured before the industrial revolution. We can also see that right now we are in a warming period so that arguing that humans are because of this is post hoc. Not to mention that we are in the coldest of the warming periods in Earth's history!We can see that once again despite contrary to belief we can see that though there may be warming the fact is simply that there is no human warming.  Contention 2: Earth is cooling.  If we observe the above graph we can see that Earth has been a whole lot hotter than where we currently are to the point where the Earth's average temperature has been 7.5 degrees Celcuis hotter than it currently it is. You can also see that in the span of the past 10,000 years the temperature has leveld off, but you may ask yourself where does that place us in the lights of modern day?  I am going to site Dr. Done Easterbrook, who is a climate scientist. Back in 2000 he predicted that Earth was entering a cooling phase. He predicts that for the next 20 years Earth will cool by 3/10 degree each year and that we are going to enter another little Ice Age like we did from 1650 and 1790. (6) The funny thing is that many of my opponent's charts are actually from the incorrect IPPC. How about the 'Hockey Stick' graph that many Global Warming supporters , including my opponent, argue about? Well if we observe the fallowing chart taken from Northern Scandenavia we can see that the Global trend over the past 1,000 years that the Global Cooling trend slope is that of -0.31 Degrees Celcuis, give or take 0.03 degrees (for the error room). Professor Dr. Jan Esper has found that the Earth's temperature of Earth actually decreases 0.3 per millenia due to the Earth moving away from the sun. (7)   Here is another graph from 1920 to 2005 and we can see that the graph has a negative temperature slope, thus meaning that the Earth is under a period of cooling. (8) You can see in terms of more Warming in the evidence in which Scientists use Ice Cores Earth has actually been Cooling the past Mellenium. You can see that in terms of Gasses contribution to the Green House Effect the major contributer is Water Vapor and it's at 95% to CO2's 3.6% and this is the overall contribution including man made and natural. When we look to the chart on the left we can see that Man-Made CO2 does have a higher contribution to the atmosphere than Water Vapor, but that's because we do not create much water vapor as humans. Even with this evidence we can see that CO2 does not have any effect what-so-ever compared to Water Vapor. (9) Where might those CFCs be on this graph you may ask. Why it's under the Misc. gases section. Once again, we can see that the IPCC and Al Gore are inccorect as the hocky stick graph is a bust. As I've shown in earlier rounds and they have been dropped in showing that the Earth's temperature has indeed been way hotter then current and on an average basis at that. My opponent has also dropped my opening graph in C1 r2 That also showed that CO2 levels are at an all time low! Thus once again disproving my opponent's theory.Here we can see that even though CO2 levels are increaseing that the temperature in recent years has actually decreased on the linear scale. Also, the US Senate Committe on Envirnment and public works also took a stab at this issue. They found that the Hocky Stick graph was also bogus in 2006. “Today’s NAS report reaffirms what I have been saying all along, that Mann's ‘hockey stick’ is broken,”Senator Inhofe said.“Today’s report refutes Mann's prior assertions that there was no Medieval Warm Period or Little Ice Age.” “This report shows that the planet warmed for about 200 years prior to the industrial age, when we were coming out of the depths of the Little Ice Age where harsh winters froze the Thames and caused untold deaths. “Trying to prove man-made global warming by comparing the well-known fact that today's temperatures are warmer than during the Little Ice Age is akin to comparing summer to winter to show a catastrophic temperature trend.” [10]Paleoclimate scientist Bob Carter had shown through his research at University of East Angila in the United Kingdom that the Climate Change increase had actually froze from 1998-2006 showing that this so called Global Warming had actually stopped. </h>

This is a very measly amount and we can see that with my opponent's claims a simple 0.15 F increase isn't enough to melt glacers and have the effeccts that he is speaking of and it proves that this is NAUTRAL not man-made to fulfil his effects if they were real.     The above graph shows that comparisions of C13 (Carbon isotope) and this shows that there is little to no trend pertrade in many of these as the average is zero while the trend for all of these are zero. [4] This is important as the Carbon isotope is important in measuring this so called 'Global Warming.'   Let us observe the above graph. Here I would like to point out the that the increase from Pre-Inustrial to Industrial era and the doubling of the CO2 leveling lead to a decrease in it's temperature. Also we can see that the 10 mile 'hot-spot' above the tropics is actually absent. 'The computer models show that greenhouse warming will cause a hot-spot at an altitude between 8 and 12 km over the tropics between 30 N and 30 S. The temperature at this hot-spot is projected to increase at a rate of two to three times faster than at the surface. However, the Hadley Centre's real-world plot of radiosonde temperature observations shown below does not show the projected CO2 induced global warming hot-spot at all. The predicted hot-spot is entirely absent from the observational record. This shows that atmosphere warming theory programmed into climate models are wrong.' [5]Now if we observe the above graph of the past 400,000 yeasrs we can see that the CO2 rates in our atmosphere has flutated the exact same way in this cycle both before and during the existance of human beings. We can see that the temperatures and CO2 levels have been going up and down randomly for the past 100 thousands years and it is observed that this occured before the industrial revolution. We can also see that right now we are in a warming period so that arguing that humans are because of this is post hoc. Not to mention that we are in the coldest of the warming periods in Earth's history!We can see that once again despite contrary to belief we can see that though there may be warming the fact is simply that there is no human warming.  Contention 2: Earth is cooling.  If we observe the above graph we can see that Earth has been a whole lot hotter than where we currently are to the point where the Earth's average temperature has been 7.5 degrees Celcuis hotter than it currently it is. You can also see that in the span of the past 10,000 years the temperature has leveld off, but you may ask yourself where does that place us in the lights of modern day?  I am going to site Dr. Done Easterbrook, who is a climate scientist. Back in 2000 he predicted that Earth was entering a cooling phase. He predicts that for the next 20 years Earth will cool by 3/10 degree each year and that we are going to enter another little Ice Age like we did from 1650 and 1790. (6) The funny thing is that many of my opponent's charts are actually from the incorrect IPPC. How about the 'Hockey Stick' graph that many Global Warming supporters , including my opponent, argue about? Well if we observe the fallowing chart taken from Northern Scandenavia we can see that the Global trend over the past 1,000 years that the Global Cooling trend slope is that of -0.31 Degrees Celcuis, give or take 0.03 degrees (for the error room). Professor Dr. Jan Esper has found that the Earth's temperature of Earth actually decreases 0.3 per millenia due to the Earth moving away from the sun. (7)   Here is another graph from 1920 to 2005 and we can see that the graph has a negative temperature slope, thus meaning that the Earth is under a period of cooling. (8) You can see in terms of more Warming in the evidence in which Scientists use Ice Cores Earth has actually been Cooling the past Mellenium. You can see that in terms of Gasses contribution to the Green House Effect the major contributer is Water Vapor and it's at 95% to CO2's 3.6% and this is the overall contribution including man made and natural. When we look to the chart on the left we can see that Man-Made CO2 does have a higher contribution to the atmosphere than Water Vapor, but that's because we do not create much water vapor as humans. Even with this evidence we can see that CO2 does not have any effect what-so-ever compared to Water Vapor. (9) Where might those CFCs be on this graph you may ask. Why it's under the Misc. gases section. Once again, we can see that the IPCC and Al Gore are inccorect as the hocky stick graph is a bust. As I've shown in earlier rounds and they have been dropped in showing that the Earth's temperature has indeed been way hotter then current and on an average basis at that. My opponent has also dropped my opening graph in C1 r2 That also showed that CO2 levels are at an all time low! Thus once again disproving my opponent's theory.Here we can see that even though CO2 levels are increaseing that the temperature in recent years has actually decreased on the linear scale. Also, the US Senate Committe on Envirnment and public works also took a stab at this issue. They found that the Hocky Stick graph was also bogus in 2006. “Today’s NAS report reaffirms what I have been saying all along, that Mann's ‘hockey stick’ is broken,”Senator Inhofe said.“Today’s report refutes Mann's prior assertions that there was no Medieval Warm Period or Little Ice Age.” “This report shows that the planet warmed for about 200 years prior to the industrial age, when we were coming out of the depths of the Little Ice Age where harsh winters froze the Thames and caused untold deaths. “Trying to prove man-made global warming by comparing the well-known fact that today's temperatures are warmer than during the Little Ice Age is akin to comparing summer to winter to show a catastrophic temperature trend.” [10]Paleoclimate scientist Bob Carter had shown through his research at University of East Angila in the United Kingdom that the Climate Change increase had actually froze from 1998-2006 showing that this so called Global Warming had actually stopped. </t>

    <t>C1) Positive feedbacks dominate climate  Carbon dioxide has a significant influence on global land-sea mean temperature. All scientists agree that CO2 has some direct effect, increasing temperature by 1.1 degrees Celsius per doubling of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. David Evans argues, “Most serious skeptical scientists have always agreed with the government climate scientists about the direct effect of CO2. The argument is entirely about the feedbacks.” [1]   Climate sensitivity is the key point in all of climate science. The term ‘climate sensitivity’ refers to -- in this context -- the rise in equilibrium global land-sea mean temperature per doubling of the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere [2]. A 2005 study by Nir Joseph Shaviv confirms that the climate sensitivity, without any amplification, is 1.1 degrees Celsius [3]. Most serious scientists agree. The argument, as Evans argues, is about the feedbacks.   What is a feedback? A feedback is a climate process that amplifies or dampens the effect of a climate forcing. A climate forcing is any factor that influences temperature increase, in this case referring to CO2. So, a feedback is anything that amplifies or dampens the effect of CO2 on climate. Feedbacks that amplify it are called positive feedbacks, while those that dampen it are negative ones [4]. I argue that positive feedbacks dominate climate, and therefore, increase the overall effect of CO2 on temperature.     Various studies report positive feedbacks as more likely. Soden and Held report a 2 degree celsius climate sensitivity due to positive feedbacks. The study reports very few negative feedbacks. “Water vapor is found to provide the largest positive feedback in all models and its strength is consistent with that expected from constant relative humidity changes in the water vapor mixing ratio. The feedbacks from clouds and surface albedo are also found to be positive in all models, while the only stabilizing (negative) feedback comes from the temperature response.” [5] A 2003 study by Colman reports a feedback of nearly 3 degrees celsius, and the paper is cited by Soden and Held. In the study, “[a] comparison is performed for water vapour, cloud, albedo and lapse rate feedbacks taken from published results of ‘offline’ feedback calculations for general circulation models (GCMs) with mixed layer oceans performing 2 x CO2 and solar perturbation experiments.” [6]  There is much evidence outside climate models as well. Wigley, et al.  report a possible sensitivity of greater than 4.5 degrees celsius due to volcanic forcings, and supports an average sensitivity of 3.5 degrees. The study says, “After the maximum cooling for low-latitude eruptions, the temperature relaxes back toward the initial state with an e-folding time of 29–43 months for sensitivities of 1–4 degrees C equilibrium warming for CO2 doubling.” [7] A 2005 study by Forster and Gregory also uses volcanic forcings and feedbacks, and finds a climate sensitivity range of 1 - 4.1 degrees Celsius [8].   Even in a hypothetical scenario where negative feedbacks cancel out positive feedbacks to a climate sensitivity of 1 degree C, research by Ziskin and Shaviv (2011) has predicted that “the largest contribution to the 20th century warming comes from anthropogenic sources.” [9] They find that of the ~0.7 degree C temperature rise in the 20th century (some estimates slightly higher), about 0.4 degrees of that are due to anthropogenic forgings, or about 57% of the warming.  Nonetheless, climate sensitivity is likely much higher than that. Research by Patrick Michaels, a CATO scholar, found that the amplifier was 1.6 degrees C [10]. This means that human activity causing global warming is much greater than 57%, even under these low estimates. I still maintain that sensitivity is somewhere around 2 - 3 degrees C. A study by leading climatologist JD Annan -- using the Bayesian statistical approach -- found a mean sensitivity of 3 degrees Celsius [11]. The following graph describes the consensus in the literature on climate sensitivity [12].     The following picture portrays the evidence regarding climate sensitivity.     As such, I conclude that the effect of the rise in CO2 on climate is huge.   C2) Evidence from paleoclimatology  The paleoclimatological record is clear that CO2 has become the chief climate forcing in the Cenozoic Era (which began after the Cretaceous mass-extinction event 65.5 million years ago). Overall, solar activity has increased by 40% in this period. James E. Hansen and Makiko Sato argue, “The sun’s brightness increased steadily through the Cenozoic, by about 0.4 percent according to solar physics models (Sackmann et al., 1993). Because Earth absorbs about 240 W/m^2 of solar energy, that brightness increase is a forcing of about 1 W/m^2 . This small linear increase of forcing, by itself, would have caused a modest global warming through the Cenozoic Era.” [13] It’s clear that “CO2 was the dominant forcing in the Cenozoic.” [13]   The temperature changes correspond to the changes in CO2 levels. Take the example of the Vostok ice cores. A study by French and Russian institutes says, “There is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr.” [14]  This graph shows the correlations between CO2 and temperature over the past 200,000 years.     There is proof that it is warmer now than since the Medieval Warm Period. In fact, it is warmer now than any year since 1400 [15]. Another study that replicated previous ‘hockey stick’ studies shows the following data [16].     Thus, paleoclimatology confirms that CO2 influences climate at huge levels.   C3) Human activity  I have now established that CO2 is responsible for much more that 57% of global warming, somewhere around 75%. Now, I must establish that humans are responsible for much of CO2 generation. First, a simple correlation -- CO2 levels rose with the beginning of industrial activity [17]. The following graph shows CO2 concentrations over the last 10,000 years.     If the ratio between C-14 and C-12 decline, the observation would virtually confirm that human activity is responsible for increase in CO2 concentration. This is because the CO2 emissions humans make come from fossil fuels [18]. This has been observed [19].   Thus, human activity has influenced CO2 decline and CO2 is a driving force of climate. Therefore, I affirm. </t>

    <t>HOUSEKEEPING1. In my Round 2 argument, I mistakenly wrote, 'I have now established that [human activity] is responsible for much more that 57% of global warming, somewhere around 75%.' I meant to write 65%, which is the actual number. That is an approximate estimate, and my estimate is closer to 62.5% of the warming (which means human activity has caused 85% of global warming since 1975, indicating a climate sensitivity of around 2 degrees C).2. Con writes, 'My opponent has also dropped my opening graph in C1 r2 That also showed that CO2 levels are at an all time low! Thus once again disproving my opponent's theory.' Note that I couldn't have dropped anything, since this *is* Con's C1, R2.  CON's CASEOverviews1. Con's first contention is a defense. It doesn't give any offense, i.e. does not provide a reason for judges to vote for his side. Con argues that CO2 does not have an effect, which merely preempts an argument that asserts that CO2 does have an effect. I ask judges to take this into consideration. I will refute that argument anyway.  2. The second contention Con presents is a 'kritik' of the topic. A 'kritik' is defined as an argument that challenges an assumption in the resolution. The second contention says global warming doesn't even exist, therefore is not man-made. Therefore, its topicality is indirect, making it a 'kritik.' Rule 6 prohibits 'kritiks.' Please note this violation. C1. Carbon Dioxide and TemperaturesCarbon dioxide does not exactly correlate with temperature. However, the radiative forcing of CO2 and the sun allows for a direct correlation. The sun drives much of modern climate change. The most recent spurt of global warming was caused by the sun, thus carbon dioxide drives climate change and is a major forcing. [1] The below graph illustrates a correlation between the forcings of the sun and CO2, and the rise in temperature. [2]  The effects of carbon dioxide increase due to positive feedback amplification. Feedbacks such as volcanic activity and clouds can significantly expand the impact of carbon dioxide on temperature. [3] The below graph depicts the correlation between carbon dioxide and temperatures over the last 700,000 years.A comparison of the warming between the troposphere and the stratosphere can demonstrate this. Majority of atmospheric carbon dioxide is found in the upper troposphere, entailing that carbon dioxide would cause higher temperatures in the troposphere than in the stratosphere. [4, 5] The following graph depicts the temperature effect of CO2 in the troposphere and stratosphere. [6] Robert Berner and Zavareth Kothavala argue, ' The exact values of CO2...should not be taken literally...[O]ver the long term, there is indeed a correlation between CO2 and paleotemperature.' [7] The following graph shows the uncertainty of values of CO2. [8]Furthermore, I can turn the entire argument against Con. This is primarily because many of the greenhouse gases mentioned - with high global warming potentials - act as positive feedbacks. Water vapor, the greenhouse gas that has the highest effect on climate, as conceded by Con, also acts as the largest positive feedback. Brian J. Soden and Isaac M. Held write, 'Water vapor is found to provide the largest positive feedback in all models and its strength is consistent with that expected from constant relative humidity changes in the water vapor mixing ratio. The feedbacks from clouds and surface albedo are also found to be positive in all models, while the only stabilizing (negative) feedback comes from the temperature response.' [9] This means the effects of water vapor help my case. A positive feedback loop would also allow CO2 level increase to cause an increase in the water vapor concentration in the atmosphere. 'When CO2 is added to the atmosphere, as a greenhouse gas it has a warming effect. This causes more water to evaporate and warm the air more to a higher (more or less) stabilized level. So CO2 warming has an amplified effect, beyond a purely CO2 effect...Without any feedbacks, a doubling of CO2 would warm the globe around 1 degree C. Taken on its own, water vapour feedback roughly doubles the amount of CO2 warming. When other feedbacks are included (eg - loss of albedo due to melting ice), the total warming from a doubling of CO2 is around 3 degrees Celsius.' [10] This is affirmed by the research of Soden and Held, who find that water vapor is the primary atmospheric feedback on Earth. [11]C2. The Temperature of the EarthAll my opponents studies are faulty and unreliable. These are the reasons. Firstly, my opponent's first graph shows the temperature of the Earth in relation to the temperature of the Earth millions of years ago. This can be discredited, because 'global warming' only began in the 19th century, after the Earth was relatively normal. The definition of global warming given in the debate concerns the 19th century. Discredit the first graph. Secondly, the idea of the 'global warming hiatus,' which my opponent brings up, is flawed. My opponent's data is largely based on TSS data. UAH and HADCRUT4 data both show that the Earth has been continuing to warm throughout the last 15 years. [12, 13] Further, the long-term trend of increasing temperatures is due to CO2. Short-term variability happens all the time; it does not mean that the long-term increase is going to stabilize forever. Oscillation phenomena, or 'La Nena' phenomena, will result in the trend changing, but will revert to a positive trend eventually. [14] Thirdly, the heat content of Earth is actually increasing. 'This new research combines measurements of oceanheat, land and atmosphere warming and ice melting to find that our climate system continued to accumulate heatthrough to 2008...Since 1970, the Earth's heat content has been rising at a rate of 6 x 10^21 Joules per year.' [15] The below graph represents this. [16] Also, 'Foster and Rahmstorf (2011) used multiple linear regression to filter out the effects of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and solar and volcanic activity (Figure 2), and found that the underlying global surface and lower atmospherewarming trends have remained very steady in recent years.' [15] The below graph portrays the data. [17]Con then reiterates the argument from water vapor, which is addressed above. He then straw-mans my position, since I did not present the hockey stick graph. Thus, I affirm. Over to Con!</t>

<h>I would like to thank my opponent for accepting this challenge.I'd like to remind the audience, and my opponent, before we get to far on the definition of Global Warming, and clarify any ambiguity. The round 1 definition should be sufficient, but to clarify Global Warming is the changes to the environment caused by manmade pollution. Pollution would be excess CO2, SO2, and so on. My opponent did not object, or provide an alternative definition in round 1 so I assume he accepts the definition.I will be presenting a controversial view that Global Warming has not accelerated the water cycle. This will have actual analysis of weather station data from NOAA. It is a large dataset, and I am willing to show anyone who asks how to begin analysing it. The Evaporation data is small enough to analyse in excel, but precipitation data would require a database or custom tools to work with. Analysis Method:In order to estimate precipitation, and evaporation levels I will be utilizing the NOAA GHCND weather station dataset. If you wish to download and verify the dataset can be found here: ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/1. To process this data the first step is to convert each stations monthly 31 day values into a single monthly median value for each station.2. Then each stations monthly median values are averages to create the average median for the life of the station.3. The station average median is then subtracted from the station median to create a delta that represents that stations change away from the average median.4. Stations are then selected based on the date of operation. For analysis starting in 1900 all weather stations that were operational in 1900 and operational at the end of the analysis must be used. Weather stations that were not operational at the start of the analysis cannot be used because they will induce an unknown bias that cannot be accounted for.5. From there the data can be graphed, or each months delta for the year can be averaged to create a yearly change for a simpler graph. 1900 to Present Precipitation:The Figure 1 below shows the change in precipitation from 1900 to 2015. As shown the precipitation for 1900 to 1930 stays consistently above the average median by about 1mm. The graph of SO2 emissions is there to demonstrate the correlation found in Global Dimming is present in this data. SO2 impedes precipitation by blocking the amount of light that reaches ocean organisms like Phytoplankton that create critical rain cloud compounds[1]. It also cutbacks on plant life by reducing light which also means less water in the air from plant transpiration which is what 90% of the water a plant gets is used for[5].As SO2 emissions were successfully cut back in 1990 there is a clear indication of an increase in precipitation. At most it increased to similar levels in the 40's and 50's up until around 2005. It is my burden to prove that the radical increase post 2005 in precipitation is clearly caused by factors not created by man.Figure 1: 1971 to Present Pan Evaporation Rate: Fortunately, NOAA's dataset does provide additional detail to see what may have changed in Figure 2. If evaporation increased due to additional heat it should appear in the Pan Evaporation rate. Regretfully there is an insufficient number of stations with pan evaporation rate data going back to 1900 so to increase the number of stations to a sufficient number for analysis the start date has been moved to 1971 allowing us to use 124 stations.Rather than show a gradual increase evaporation from gradual warming the pan evaporation stays constant from 1971 until about 2010-2011 where it then makes a radical change which correlates to the radical change in precipitation.Figure 2: 1980 to Present Precipitation and Evaporation:In order to get a better idea of what is happening the date range will need to be compressed further to allow the number of stations to be increased for further analysis. This way we will have 10,209 stations for precipitation, and 156 stations for evaporation for monthly analysis. We can see in Figure 3 better detail what a 20% decrease in SO2 pollution did to the precipitation rate. Unfortunately the increase in 2005, and later, was due to China, and India having increased SO2 pollution[7].Now we can see a mild increase in evaporation starting in 2005, and the shift in 2010 can be isolated to October 2010 using a box and whiskers analysis on the dataset to flag outliers.Figure 3: Solar Forcing of Evaporation:October 2010 is a very important time period. It marks a violent beginning of the Sun's solar cycle 24 approach to solar maximum as shown with NASA's October 18th 2010 image of the Sun ramping up for a Solar Flare[8]. Note in the Figure 4 October 2010 is not solar maximum, but the significant shift upwards in sunspot. By graphing the Sun's Sunspots it is possible to see if cycle 24 had an actual influence on the evaporation rate. Clearly the increase in evaporation has many of the same features as cycle 24 in Figure 4. However, none of the prior cycles appear to have any significant influence. However, in 2008 NASA announced that they had discovered the Earth's Electromagnetic Field was weakening[2]. This weakening most likely began before it was detected leading one to believe that higher than normal levels of light, and radiation began to leak in explaining the small increase during the previous solar minimum. As the field began weakening further evaporation accelerated. This also feed more plants, and phytoplankton allowing for more rapid development of rain clouds post 2005.Now that the Earth's field is weakening 10 times faster[3] than before explaining the continued increase even thow sunspots are on the decline. None of the increases above 1900 to 1930 norms can be attributed to any man made causes, and is entirely separate from any global warming claims. The accelerated water cycle is caused by the complex machinations of the Sun, and Earth's Magnetic Field.</h>

Regretfully there is an insufficient number of stations with pan evaporation rate data going back to 1900 so to increase the number of stations to a sufficient number for analysis the start date has been moved to 1971 allowing us to use 124 stations.Rather than show a gradual increase evaporation from gradual warming the pan evaporation stays constant from 1971 until about 2010-2011 where it then makes a radical change which correlates to the radical change in precipitation.Figure 2: 1980 to Present Precipitation and Evaporation:In order to get a better idea of what is happening the date range will need to be compressed further to allow the number of stations to be increased for further analysis. This way we will have 10,209 stations for precipitation, and 156 stations for evaporation for monthly analysis. We can see in Figure 3 better detail what a 20% decrease in SO2 pollution did to the precipitation rate. Unfortunately the increase in 2005, and later, was due to China, and India having increased SO2 pollution[7].Now we can see a mild increase in evaporation starting in 2005, and the shift in 2010 can be isolated to October 2010 using a box and whiskers analysis on the dataset to flag outliers.Figure 3: Solar Forcing of Evaporation:October 2010 is a very important time period. It marks a violent beginning of the Sun's solar cycle 24 approach to solar maximum as shown with NASA's October 18th 2010 image of the Sun ramping up for a Solar Flare[8]. Note in the Figure 4 October 2010 is not solar maximum, but the significant shift upwards in sunspot. By graphing the Sun's Sunspots it is possible to see if cycle 24 had an actual influence on the evaporation rate. Clearly the increase in evaporation has many of the same features as cycle 24 in Figure 4. However, none of the prior cycles appear to have any significant influence. However, in 2008 NASA announced that they had discovered the Earth's Electromagnetic Field was weakening[2]. This weakening most likely began before it was detected leading one to believe that higher than normal levels of light, and radiation began to leak in explaining the small increase during the previous solar minimum. As the field began weakening further evaporation accelerated. This also feed more plants, and phytoplankton allowing for more rapid development of rain clouds post 2005.Now that the Earth's field is weakening 10 times faster[3] than before explaining the continued increase even thow sunspots are on the decline. None of the increases above 1900 to 1930 norms can be attributed to any man made causes, and is entirely separate from any global warming claims. The accelerated water cycle is caused by the complex machinations of the Sun, and Earth's Magnetic Field.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank my opponent. Since this is a repeat of my prior debate I'll start off with that.I will be presenting a controversial view that Global Warming has not accelerated the water cycle. This will have actual analysis of weather station data from NOAA. It is a large dataset, and I am willing to show anyone who asks how to begin analysing it. The Evaporation data is small enough to analyse in excel, but precipitation data would require a database or custom tools to work with.Analysis Method:In order to estimate precipitation, and evaporation levels I will be utilizing the NOAA GHCND weather station dataset. If you wish to download and verify the dataset can be found here: ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/1) To process this data the first step is to convert each stations monthly 31 day values into a single monthly median value for each station.2) Then each stations monthly median values are averages to create the average median for the life of the station.3) The station average median is then subtracted from the station median to create a delta that represents that stations change away from the average median.4)  Stations are then selected based on the date of operation. For analysis starting in 1900 all weather stations that were operational in 1900 and operational at the end of the analysis must be used. Weather stations that were not operational at the start of the analysis cannot be used because they will induce an unknown bias that cannot be accounted for.5) From there the data can be graphed, or each months delta for the year can be averaged to create a yearly change for a simpler graph.1900 to Present Precipitation The Figure 1 below shows the change in precipitation from 1900 to 2015. As shown the precipitation for 1900 to 1930 stays consistently above the average median by about 1mm. The graph of SO2 emissions is there to demonstrate the correlation found in Global Dimming is present in this data. SO2 impedes precipitation by blocking the amount of light that reaches ocean organisms like Phytoplankton that create critical rain cloud compounds[1]. It also cutbacks on plant life by reducing light which also means less water in the air from plant transpiration which is what 90% of the water a plant gets is used for[5].As SO2 emissions were successfully cut back in 1990 there is a clear indication of an increase in precipitation. At most it increased to similar levels in the 40’s and 50’s up until around 2005. It is my burden to prove that the radical increase post 2005 in precipitation is clearly caused by factors not created by man.Figure 1:1971 to Present Pan Evaporation Rate:Fortunately, NOAA’s dataset does provide additional detail to see what may have changed in Figure 2.

My opponent makes the claim that global warming is bad, and should be stopped. However, this is contingent on the existence of global warming. One of the claims of global warming is that it has accelerated the water cycle, and my claim is that global warming has not. If one of the claims of global warming is in doubt that it is reasonable to doubt that global warming exists as claimed.  As for the quality of the water cycles nature as Good, or Bad that is irrelevant to this debate, and subjective. An accelerated water cycle would mean more fresh water, and many people are in need of more fresh water. However, it could also make large storms more prevalent for others. It is irrelevant since this debate is about global warming having caused it, and not about if it is good, or bad.</t>

    <t>Dam Rivers:I like that river in Egypt - De Nile. Fun fact, since 1970 the Nile in Egypt hasn’t done it’s annual floods. Amazing isn’t it? A river iconified in myth, and legend representing the cycles of death and rebirth though its life giving floods depositing fertile silt hasn’t flooded in almost 4 and a half decades. It’s amazing what changes the Aswan Dam has done to the Nile for Egypt.My opponent brings up an important point about the freshwater river mouth surge data, and that it is of a very limited time frame of 1994 to 2006. That wouldn’t actually contradict my data since from 1990 there was in an increasing trend in precipitation due to a reduction in SO2 pollution. However, it has an even bigger flaw. Even if there was an increase in precipitation there is very little reason it would actually increase the outflow of water at a river mouth. Perhaps two centuries ago it would have, but over the last 200 years we have left very few rivers free of hydro engineering[9].Any excess water has a much better chance of being banked into the world's reservoir system then it has of just being flushed downstream. It’s not like we don’t have irrigation networks built to divert overflow in one reservoir into other depleted reservoirs[11][12].'Our reservoir system is built so that as one reservoir fills that water spills over into another reservoir,' Libby Pischel[13]So why would we have any increase in river water at the mouth of a river unless we did it deliberately? If the last reservoir on a river overflows then it would have no where to go, but the last reservoir only represents a small fraction of the dammed water. A more likely cause is increased electrical demand. If we want to utilize the water for electricity we have to send it down to the next dam so it can use it for electricity[14]. Then there is fish and wildlife maintenance were we deliberately maintain a higher rate of speed to keep the fish healthy[15]. One may be able to argue that the over dammed waterways are a detriment, or a boom. However, there is hardly a single cubic foot of water that leave waterways that we didn’t intend on it leaving. Had my opponent's source been able to tap into a larger samples with with less of a limited sampling bias by having river data from prior to the rise of dams they may have come to a different conclusion.Global Historical Climatology Network:The advantage to the GHCN data that I’ve processed is that is that is contains all of the world's weather station data.  It makes it possible to attempt to verify what is, or is not wrong with my opponent's source that claims that there has been a 12% increase in weather ‘events’. Unfortunately, the actual study is hidden behind a nice pay wall, but the abstract can be read here. It is also cross references another study at the American Meteorological Society[17], and the PDF can be viewed here. The first problem with all studies of extreme precipitation events can be summarized by quoting a part of the 2nd page on the study above.These and other studies, which all differ in their methods of analysis, definition of extreme precipitation indices, and/or the observational datasets used, consistently report increases in extreme precipitation in more land locations globally than locations with decreases.In other words the definition of ‘extreme precipitation’ is a cherry picked definition, and all of these are only of ‘extreme’ events, and not a sum, average, or median of the precipitation. The reason they don’t use the far more direct argument is that would be Figure 1, and it disagrees with their world view.Further analysis of my opponents source reveals a claim that shows that their results are nothing more than an anomaly caused by their statistical methodology. To quote his sourceThe average increase is 12 percent globally – but 56 percent in South East Asia56% is an outlier nearly 4 and a half times away from the average, and should have flagged the results for closer scrutiny. A closer examination of the South East Asia, SEA, precipitation data in GHCN data shows the cause as limited sampling bias. In other words, SEA has about 369 weather stations reporting precipitation data. However, the earliest weather stations started reporting in 1943: SONGKHLA, DON MUANG, CHIANG MAI, and UDON THANI. A statistically viable sample doesn’t even exist until 1950 when about 30 to 100 stations are reporting. That puts the majority of SEA’s measurements after Global Dimming had reduced the precipitation rate so it stands to reason that they’d see an increase in ‘extreme’ precipitation when rain started to return to normal in 1990.By including weather station with varying limited sampling bias like SEA they induced a non response bias into their 12% figure. This kind of bias is actually addressed in my analysis in step 4. By restricting the analysis to only include those that existed at the start, and at the end non response bias is mitigated only to events that may have shut a station down for a period of time. Limited sampling bias is also addressed by using the largest date range, and maintain a suitably large sample size.Humidity:As for my opponents 3rd source that attempts to prove that humidity has escalated due to global warming it suffers from the same deficiencies as his other sources. Namely limited sampling bias. The study uses only time period of 1973 to 2007 which means that it falls completely under the Clean Air Act of 1970 where SO2 emissions were held back and then reduced in the 90’s. Because of their samples limited score they’d be unable to determine if the cause was out of line with an atmosphere returning more to a 1930’s era, or if it was global warming.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank medv4380 for presenting his arguments.The Water CycleI want to start by providing a brief description of the water cycle, and what it means to accelerate the water cycle. At the most basic level, the water cycle is the explanation of why precipitation occurs. Water evaporates from the oceans as a result of solar heat input, rises into the atmosphere, condenses as the air gets cooler (forming clouds), moves on land, releases its water, which heads back circuitously into the ocean. Here is a picture showing the many intricacies of the water cycle:[1]The acceleration of the water cycle would mean that the cycle is becoming stronger - more water evaporates, implying that more precipitation occurs. It is my burden, then, to show that more precipitation is occurring now compared to 115 years ago.Global Warming and the Water CycleAt the most basic level, a warmer climate would mean that there would be more precipitation, because more water would evaporate from the oceans, due to the fact that the chance of a water molecule in the oceans breaking free of its bonds with other water molecules would be more likely to escape, and given enougn kinetic energy (and it's moving in the right direction), the water would do so. While the climate does work like this, the climate is a bit more complicated than that. Some places will get dryer because warmer climates dry the soil out faster, and regions that don't typically get a lot of rain can suffer as a result.There are many ways one can observe an acceleration of the climate cycle. One obvious way would be to find that the amount of precipitation falling around the Earth is increasing. This is indeed the case. 'An advanced statistical analysis of rainfall data from the years 1901 to 2010 derived from thousands of weather stations around the globe shows that over 1980-2010 there were 12 percent more of these events than expected in a stationary climate, a scenario without global warming.' This seems to show that global warming is accelerating the water cycle. However, there are many other indicators that this is so.[2]One could look at how much water is being evaporated from the oceans and how much water is running off in rivers, for example (we'd expect an increase in both of these indicators).  A measure of how much water is being evaporated is humidity - a measure of the 'saturation' of the atmosphere (the atmosphere can only hold so much water vapor; humidity measures the percentage of this amount). The greater the evaporation, the greater the global humidity, because there's more water vapor in the atmosphere. 'All five reanalyses produce similar relations, with increasing surface temperature being associated with increasing atmospheric specific humidity. These results agree with previous analyses that the water vapor feedback in response to shortR08; term variations is strongly positive. This is also consistent with P09, who looked at the seasonal cycle in the extratropics in the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis and found that it showed a positive correlation between surface temperature and 500 hPa specific humidity.'[3]How much water is being run off in rivers?  'For the relatively short 13-year period studied here, global discharge increased by 540 km^3W25;y^2 [this is a rate of approximately 1.5 percent a year], which was largely attributed to an increase of globalocean evaporation (768 km^3W25;y^2). Sustained growth of these flux rates into long-term trends would provide evidence for increasing intensity of the hydrologic cycle.' A graph of this increase can be seen below[4][5]: The data that clouds give us is more difficult to understand. You'd think that more evaporation would entail there being more clouds, but this isn't necessarily true. The way clouds work is much more complicated than that. In addition, you have to contend with the feedbacks that clouds cause.What is the evidence that the acceleration of the water cycle is due to global warming? Well, warmer air holds more moisture. We'd expect precipitation increases to follow the change in the temperature of the atmosphere. 'While a statistical analysis of course cannot provide direct physical cause-effect relations, the scientists compared their findings to existing knowledge about how much more water can be stored in the atmosphere when temperatures rise, as given by the well-known Clausius-Clapeyron equation. This additional moisture can be released during short-term heavy rainfall events. The scientists show that the observed increase in unprecedented heavy rainfall events generally fits with this thermodynamically expected increase under global warming.'[2]Overall, the significant acceleration of the water cycle is unlikely to be due to any natural variation of the climate, nor is it likely to just be a statistical anomoly. The theory behind anthropogenic global warming clearly explains why the water cycle is accelerating, as a warmer atmosphere would evaporate water faster and would be able to hold more of that water vapor.ConclusionOverall, the water cycle involves evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and runoff. I've shown that evaporation (in the form of humidity), precipitation, and runoff have all increased, and this is most likely due to global warming, due to the connection between warming and the acceleration of the water cycle.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank medv4380 for presenting his rebuttals.If I'm reading my opponent's argument correctly, he seems to be arguing that solar activity is the cause of the evaporation increase, saying that the reduction in solar activity causes the Earth's magnetic field to weaken, causing more radiation to reach Earth. However, if this is indeed his case, it has two problems. One, it posits that the strength of the Earth's magnetic field is determined by solar activity, and that there is a correlation between magnetic field strength and water cycle strength.Earth's magnetic field originates from moving charged particles at its core. 'Magnetic fields are produced by the motion of electrical charges. For example, the magnetic field of a bar magnet results from the motion of negatively charged electrons in the magnet. The origin of the Earth's magnetic field is not completely understood, but is thought to be associated with electrical currents produced by the coupling of convective effects and rotation in the spinning liquid metallic outer core of iron and nickel. This mechanism is termed the dynamo effect.' Thus, it seems that solar activity has nothing to do with the strength of the Earth's magnetic field. A decline in solar activity then would not cause the water cycle to accelerate. But there's still the problem of whether magnetic field strength has any effect on the temperature. Below are three graphs - one of the Earth's magnetic dipole moment (a measure of how strong the Earth's magnetic field is), one of solar irradiance (a measure of solar activity), and one of a measure of precipitation levels.s://www.ipcc.ch...; alt='Figure TS.10' /gt;[2][3][4]As you can see, it doesn't appear that Eaerth's magnetic field strength correlates with solar activity. In fact, just purely looking at the data, it appears that the opposite is true - increased solar irradiance decreases Earth's magnetic field strength, not decreased solar irradiance. As for the magnetic field strength/precipitation correlation, the question is a bit more complicated. Unfortunately, we don't have (or at least I can't find) global precipitation anomalies for more than 100 years. However, there's two things I'd like to note. One, if precipitation was really affected by magnetic field strength due to the amount of solar radiation Earth absorbs, then, since the decrease in magnetic field strength is linearly downwards, we'd expect precipitation levels to follow solar irradiance, because that also determines how much radiation the Earth receives. However, precipitation trends do not seem to follow solar irradiance (if they did, you'd expect 11-year cycles in precipitation levels). And two, you'd think that, since solar activity has been decreasing a lot lately, that precipitation levels would trend down. If the amount of radiation reaching Earth is the key here, then you'd need to consider solar irradiance and magnetic field strength together. The most you have is a 5-year trend. In the grand scheme of the 115 years this debate considers, that's a statistically insignificant trend, especially since the magnetic field strength has been declining for at least 400 years, and there don't seem to be any other precipitation/solar irradiance links for any of the other solar cycles.ConclusionI apologize if this was a bit choppy - I've had a lot do the past few days. However, I feel like I've covered the gist of it. The solar irradiance/magnetic field strength and magnetic field strength/water cycle rate correlations do not seem to exist, save for the past five years, which is statistically insignificant on climatological time scales.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank medv4380 for this debate.Dam RiversThere are three responses to this. One, human impacts only account for about half of the observed increase in river runoff. 'On average, land-use change has increased global runoff by 0.08 mm/year^2 and accounts for ~50% of the reconstructed global runoff trend over the last century.' There's still the other half that needs to be accounted for.[1]Two, CO2 also has a negative effect on river runoff. 'When allowing for the increase in foliage area that results from increasing atmospheric CO2 levels in a global vegetation model, we find a decrease in global runoff from 1901 to 1999.' This seems a bit counterintuitive. However, the increased precipitation that CO2 induced warming has caused has still had an effect on the rivers. The effect is just masked by the land-use changes and negative feedback related to plant growth. This is entirely separate from the water cycle.[1]And three, this topic has been very controversial, namely owing to different collections of data and statistical methods used with that data. However, this science is solid.HumidityActually, decreased SO2 levels would cause humidity levels to reduce. 'Trajectory studies and model simulations suggest that the SO2increase results in the formation of more sulfuric acid aerosol particles in the upper tropical troposphere. As a consequence, more ice crystals of smaller size are formed in the tropical tropopause, which are lifted into the stratosphere more readily. Our model calculations suggest that such a mechanism could increase the amount of water that entered the stratosphere in the condensed phase by up to 0.5 ppmv from 1950–2000.' While the decrease in SO2 emissions has slowed the rise in humidity levels a little, CO2 levels are still rising exponentially.[2]ConclusionOverall, this is basic physics. A warmer climate, caused by rising greenhouse gas emissions, causes more water to evaporate from the oceans, which causes more rain to fall, which causes the river runoff to increase. While we have been affecting river runoff in other ways, the underlying data is still there. My opponent has also failed to adequately refute my humidity (related to the amount of water in the atmosphere), and he has completely dropped my precipitation point. My opponent has provided a confusing, uncertain, and misguided argument himself. The evidence supports the conclusion that human induced global warming is the cause of the acceleration of the water cycle.</t>

Not having this useful tool of the future would severely hurt our society.-Smaller foot-print It releases lower green-house gases, and is one of the safest ways of producing energy. NASA writes, 'Human-caused climate change and air pollution remain major global-scale problems and are both due mostly to fossil fuel burning. Mitigation efforts for both of these problems should be undertaken concurrently in order to maximize effectiveness. Such efforts can be accomplished largely with currently available low-carbon and carbon-free alternative energy sources like nuclear power and renewables, as well as energy efficiency improvements.'[1]NASA also caculated that nuclear power prevented an average of 64 gigatonnes of CO2-equivalent (GtCO2-eq) net GHG emissions globally between 1971-2009, preventing the harm of our atmosphere. Nuclear waste can also be easily recycled, and a company supported by Bill Gates in currently doing this.-Safer for workersNuclear energy is also much safer for workers in these nuclear plants, compared to coal mining and other fossil fuels. This graph, from NASA show my point. Mean net deaths prevented annually by nuclear power between 1971-2009 for various countries/regions.  'There is no question,' says Joseph Romm, an energy expert at the Center for American Progress in Washington DC. 'Nothing is worse than fossil fuels for killing people.' A 2002 review by the IEA put nuclear energy on top, as safest, and fossil fuels as the most harmful. Saves lives== -medicine and treatments.  Nuclear medicine uses radiation letting doctors to make a quick, accurate diagnosis of the patient's specific organs, or to treat them. Radiotherapy can be used to treat some medical conditions, especially cancer, using radiation to weaken or destroy particular targeted cells.   Tens of millions of patients are treated with nuclear medicine each year Over 10,000 hospitals worldwide use radioisotopes in medicine, and about 90% of the procedures are for diagnosis.  The most common radioisotope used in diagnosis is technetium-99, with some 30 million procedures per year.-Lives saved in WWII During world war two, the only other option for the allies to defeat imperil japan was operation olympus, and coronet. these operations would have cost about a million men for the allies and nearly twice that or more, for the united states.

    <t>Thank you Pro.   C1: Nuclear Weapons seriously threaten the human race   Nuclear weapons are so far one of the only weapons mankind has developed that could end the human race as we know it, and in fact, almost did more than once. In 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the world was close to nuclear war. Former Sec. of Defence Robert McNamara said, “We lucked out. It was luck that prevented a nuclear war. We came that close to nuclear war. Rational individuals! Kennedy was rational, Khrushchev was rational, Castro was rational. Rational individuals came that close to total destruction of their societies, and that danger exists today. The major lesson of the Cuban Missile Crisis is this: the indefinite combination of human fallibility and nuclear weapons will destroy nations!” Almost no other weapon besides perhaps chemical warfare has the kind of domino effect that nuclear weapons has. If one is launched, many will be launched. All it takes is the wrong leader with the right capability. A nation like North Korea, or Pakistan, or even Israel. If 100 small, regional nuclear devices were detonated, we would lose 20-50% of the ozone, followed by a brutal nuclear winter – difficult to survive. If a proper nuclear war occurred, with a real arsenal being launched, we could expect to see the extinction of the human race – a terrible nuclear winter, crippling UV damage, rapid cooling down -30 degrees Celsius, not to mention the primary effects of the weapons themselves. Bombs made fifty years ago were so powerful they could ‘scorch earth’ nine miles of land above ground and penetrate 230 m underground. When the Soviet Union tested the nuke ‘Tsar Bomba’ almost sixty years ago the resulting explosion was so powerful it blew a 5 mile fireball followed by a 35 mile high mushroom cloud that burst past the stratosphere into the mesosphere. This was 54 years ago, and that explosion blew the windows in houses 125 miles away and caused a 5.5 earthquake. Let’s not even imagine what kind of weapons we must have today. </t>

As for his defense of the weapons in relation to WWII, that point is debatable. One A-Bomb was more than enough.

<h>The trade regulations I advocate are targeted towards specific problems with unfettered free trade. I don't argue massive tariffs on every industry. To the extent that Pro's rebuttals attack wholesale protectionism, they simply miss their mark.SurvivalPro admits that we must drastically reduce carbon emissions to save our planet. Pro admits that we must do this now before it's too late. And Pro admits that global warming is an externality. Yet instead of *internalizing* global warming, Pro says we're better off leaving our survival to the chance that the market will reduce emissions on its own.Pro fails to realize that free trade is driven solely by prices, and if prices don't account for the harmful effects of carbon emissions, there's no incentive to reduce carbon emissions. In fact, the opposite happens: carbon emissions increase as a way to grab a cost advantage. Carbon emissions have increased every single year over the past 30 years as we've liberalized trade. We need to change that now. And the change can't be incremental. We need to lower emissions by at least 8-10%  per year to ensure our survival. [23] Free markets alone can't effect that kind of change.Pro dismisses my arguments because they lacked any sources. But not all arguments require sources. Mine doesn't. The argument I made is analytic, not empirical. But experience proves me right.Pro also cites two sources. They don't help.The first source 'estimates' that a 1% increase in sulfur dioxide output from free trade leads to a decrease in sulfur dioxide concentration of around .8%. The estimation is based on a limited theoretic framework and limited empirical data (since it doesn't look at actual free trade). It's also totally irrelevant because it dealt with sulfur dioxide. The source even notes that limitation explicitly: 'Free trade appears to lower sulfur dioxide concentrations for an average country in our sample, but may of course worsen the environment through other channels. Our evidence is specific to sulfur dioxide.' The issue in this debate is reducing carbon dioxide, not sulfur dioxide. Carbon emissions are an entirely different ballpark. The regulations that affect carbon are completely different than the regulations that affect sulfur emissions. Also, note that Pro's source actually finds an increase in pollution output. It's the increase in output that also leads to a decrease in concentration. This is very limited evidence compared to the huge number of studies showing harm to the environment from free trade: [18] [19] [20] [21] [22]  Pro's second source supports my argument, not Pro's. It states: 'Current actions are not enough if we are to stabilize greenhouse gases (GHGs) at any acceptable level. The economic challenges are complex and will require a long-term international collaboration to tackle them.' Acknowleding that 'no [trade] measures for climate change are in use anywhere in the world,' it finds that 'theoretical analysis points to a role for trade restrictions.' In fact, Pro completely distorts his source's findings. Pro fails to mention that we're talking about liberalizing trade in renewables while maintaining tariffs on fossil fuels. The study finds, just as I suggested in R2, that taxing carbon-intensive industries while liberalizing trade in renewables leads to increased use of renewables, which in turn leads to a reduction in emissions. This is precisely what I suggested would happen with a tariff targeted specifically at fossil fuels.  Pro argues that 'tariffs would lead to an inefficient allocation of resources due to the loss of comparative advantage.' But inefficiency is a better outcome than human extinction. And again, Pro's argument relies on the theory of 'comparative advantage,' which is wrong (see R2). Pro dropped that, or apparently deferred his response.Pro says 'losing efficiency means more waste and higher emissions from inefficient production.' This is untrue. First, Pro offers no evidence that 'inefficient allocation' leads to 'inefficient production.' On the contrary, as Pro's second source suggests, targeted tariffs and subsidies can increase efficient production and reduce emissions by encouraging efficient clean energy. Second, 'waste' refers to an economic loss, not to an environmental harm. Don't let Pro muddle this this issue: we're weighing potential economic growth against certain extinction of our species. Given our looming planetary ecological catastrophe, it's clear that environmental protections are necessary even at the cost of degrowth. Which isn't to say there's any degrowth; I'm just emphasizing the importance of collapse of reducing emissions.  SustainabilityPro argues that there's no link between free trade and our international investment position. But that is simply untrue. Free trade *allows* deficit trading, which is directly related to a country's international investment position. An international investment position is a statement of a country's foreign assets and debts. Free trade creates foreign debts via trade deficits.Pro completely drops my impacts. The results of deficit trading are disastrous for our economy. If there are any economic benefits to free trade, they're completely outweighed by the harms from deficit trading.Trade regulations can bring our trade closer into balance. Warren Buffet suggested one solution: give exporters $1 certificates for every dollar they export, and then require that importers buy a certificate for every dollar of goods they import. This would immediately bring our trade into balance.Pro broadly asserts that all trade regulations hurt the economy. But Pro offers no substantiation for this assertion. I've explained how trade deficits weaken our economy. Pro hasn't argued otherwise.Smoot-Hawley is irrelevant. I'm don't argue for Smoot-Hawley or anything even remotely similar. I support initiatives that bring our trade closer to balance, not drastic increases on tariffs for all industries. Pro's attack on Smoot-Hawley is a strawman and a red herring.InequalityPro admits that free trade increases inequality. Pro also drops all the impacts of inequality. Those impacts include more mental illness, drug abuse, obesity, teenage pregnancy, crime, violence, lower life expectancy, harm to trust and community life, harm to overall child well-being, and unsurprisingly, harm to the economy.Remarkably, Pro nonetheless asserts without any substantiation that economic growth from free trade outweighs all these social harms. I have two responses. First, the impact from an increase in GDP simply cannot outweigh these harms. Pro doesn't even tell us what the impact is. Growth has little if any positive impact. It simply means more wealth. It doesn't tell us who possesses that wealth. Nor does it tell us if more wealth is good for those people.What are they buying with that money? In the US, only a tiny proportion of production and human labor is devoted to actual human needs as opposed to market-generated wants. Over a trillion dollars is spent every year on marketing. More growth means more marketing, more market-generated wants, and more consumption of stuff we don't need. More growth doesn't mean more food, clothing, shelter, health care, education, or public transportation. More growth doesn't mean a cleaner environment. More growth doesn't mean less poverty or inequality. And most importantly, more growth doesn't mean more happiness. Research has found 'no trace of a relationship between income and happiness.' In fact, studies suggest that 'wealth may undermine people's ability to savor positive events.' [17] In other words, the rich may experience less happiness because awesome things like caviar and champagne become a regular experience instead of something to appreciate and savor. Accumulating wealth for its own sake might even be net harmful.Second, Pro fails to address my point that inequality slows economic growth. Pro hasn't offered a single reason to believe that growth from free trade outweighs degrowth from inequality. Pro's source, an article by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, offers no substantiation for its assertions. The article doesn't explain how free trade leads to job growth. It simply assert that free trade increases GDP based on an observed GDP increase. But there's no analysis as to what caused the GDP increase; it could have been any number of things besides free trade. And even if GDP increases, it doesn't mean the benefits pass onto most Americans. Most Americans work blue-collar jobs and are thus left unemployed by free trade. Then, they end up less happy because of greater inequality, and end up being at higher risk for mental illness, obesity, crime, and all the other impacts of inequality. To assert that an abstract quantifier like GDP outweighs all the harms from an increase in inequality simply misunderstands the nature of human well-being and happiness.RebuttalPro defers his defense of 'innovation and the gains of trade' until R4. This deprives me of a rebuttal in R3, which is both unfair and a violation of Pro's requirements in R1. With three days per round, Pro effectively gets nine days to write his defense while I only get three days to respond. Timing matters. Six extra days of research and polish increases the quality of one's arguments significantly. Pro gets an unfair structural advantage because of that. If Pro had no intention of addressing my rebuttal until R4, the debate should have been structured to limit rebuttals to R3 and R4. Instead, Pro required rebuttal in R2. Not addressing that rebuttal until R4 is abusive towards that requirement. Pro says he 'ran out of time.' But that's not an excuse. Everyone must balance time. R1 states: 'you must make sure that there are no things in your schedule that would potentially prevent you from completing every round.' Yet Pro couldn't complete his round because he 'ran out of time.' Punish him for that.Sources in the comments and reposted in R4.</h>

[23] Free markets alone can't effect that kind of change.Pro dismisses my arguments because they lacked any sources. But not all arguments require sources. Mine doesn't. The argument I made is analytic, not empirical. But experience proves me right.Pro also cites two sources. They don't help.The first source 'estimates' that a 1% increase in sulfur dioxide output from free trade leads to a decrease in sulfur dioxide concentration of around .8%. The estimation is based on a limited theoretic framework and limited empirical data (since it doesn't look at actual free trade). It's also totally irrelevant because it dealt with sulfur dioxide. The source even notes that limitation explicitly: 'Free trade appears to lower sulfur dioxide concentrations for an average country in our sample, but may of course worsen the environment through other channels. Our evidence is specific to sulfur dioxide.' The issue in this debate is reducing carbon dioxide, not sulfur dioxide. Carbon emissions are an entirely different ballpark. The regulations that affect carbon are completely different than the regulations that affect sulfur emissions. Also, note that Pro's source actually finds an increase in pollution output. It's the increase in output that also leads to a decrease in concentration. This is very limited evidence compared to the huge number of studies showing harm to the environment from free trade: [18] [19] [20] [21] [22]  Pro's second source supports my argument, not Pro's. It states: 'Current actions are not enough if we are to stabilize greenhouse gases (GHGs) at any acceptable level. The economic challenges are complex and will require a long-term international collaboration to tackle them.' Acknowleding that 'no [trade] measures for climate change are in use anywhere in the world,' it finds that 'theoretical analysis points to a role for trade restrictions.' In fact, Pro completely distorts his source's findings. Pro fails to mention that we're talking about liberalizing trade in renewables while maintaining tariffs on fossil fuels. The study finds, just as I suggested in R2, that taxing carbon-intensive industries while liberalizing trade in renewables leads to increased use of renewables, which in turn leads to a reduction in emissions. This is precisely what I suggested would happen with a tariff targeted specifically at fossil fuels.  Pro argues that 'tariffs would lead to an inefficient allocation of resources due to the loss of comparative advantage.' But inefficiency is a better outcome than human extinction. And again, Pro's argument relies on the theory of 'comparative advantage,' which is wrong (see R2). Pro dropped that, or apparently deferred his response.Pro says 'losing efficiency means more waste and higher emissions from inefficient production.' This is untrue. First, Pro offers no evidence that 'inefficient allocation' leads to 'inefficient production.' On the contrary, as Pro's second source suggests, targeted tariffs and subsidies can increase efficient production and reduce emissions by encouraging efficient clean energy. Second, 'waste' refers to an economic loss, not to an environmental harm. Don't let Pro muddle this this issue: we're weighing potential economic growth against certain extinction of our species. Given our looming planetary ecological catastrophe, it's clear that environmental protections are necessary even at the cost of degrowth. Which isn't to say there's any degrowth; I'm just emphasizing the importance of collapse of reducing emissions.  SustainabilityPro argues that there's no link between free trade and our international investment position. But that is simply untrue. Free trade *allows* deficit trading, which is directly related to a country's international investment position. An international investment position is a statement of a country's foreign assets and debts. Free trade creates foreign debts via trade deficits.Pro completely drops my impacts. The results of deficit trading are disastrous for our economy. If there are any economic benefits to free trade, they're completely outweighed by the harms from deficit trading.Trade regulations can bring our trade closer into balance. Warren Buffet suggested one solution: give exporters $1 certificates for every dollar they export, and then require that importers buy a certificate for every dollar of goods they import. This would immediately bring our trade into balance.Pro broadly asserts that all trade regulations hurt the economy. But Pro offers no substantiation for this assertion. I've explained how trade deficits weaken our economy. Pro hasn't argued otherwise.Smoot-Hawley is irrelevant. I'm don't argue for Smoot-Hawley or anything even remotely similar. I support initiatives that bring our trade closer to balance, not drastic increases on tariffs for all industries. Pro's attack on Smoot-Hawley is a strawman and a red herring.InequalityPro admits that free trade increases inequality. Pro also drops all the impacts of inequality. Those impacts include more mental illness, drug abuse, obesity, teenage pregnancy, crime, violence, lower life expectancy, harm to trust and community life, harm to overall child well-being, and unsurprisingly, harm to the economy.Remarkably, Pro nonetheless asserts without any substantiation that economic growth from free trade outweighs all these social harms. I have two responses. First, the impact from an increase in GDP simply cannot outweigh these harms. Pro doesn't even tell us what the impact is. Growth has little if any positive impact. It simply means more wealth. It doesn't tell us who possesses that wealth. Nor does it tell us if more wealth is good for those people.What are they buying with that money? In the US, only a tiny proportion of production and human labor is devoted to actual human needs as opposed to market-generated wants. Over a trillion dollars is spent every year on marketing. More growth means more marketing, more market-generated wants, and more consumption of stuff we don't need. More growth doesn't mean more food, clothing, shelter, health care, education, or public transportation. More growth doesn't mean a cleaner environment. More growth doesn't mean less poverty or inequality. And most importantly, more growth doesn't mean more happiness. Research has found 'no trace of a relationship between income and happiness.' In fact, studies suggest that 'wealth may undermine people's ability to savor positive events.' [17] In other words, the rich may experience less happiness because awesome things like caviar and champagne become a regular experience instead of something to appreciate and savor. Accumulating wealth for its own sake might even be net harmful.Second, Pro fails to address my point that inequality slows economic growth. Pro hasn't offered a single reason to believe that growth from free trade outweighs degrowth from inequality. Pro's source, an article by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, offers no substantiation for its assertions. The article doesn't explain how free trade leads to job growth. It simply assert that free trade increases GDP based on an observed GDP increase. But there's no analysis as to what caused the GDP increase; it could have been any number of things besides free trade. And even if GDP increases, it doesn't mean the benefits pass onto most Americans. Most Americans work blue-collar jobs and are thus left unemployed by free trade. Then, they end up less happy because of greater inequality, and end up being at higher risk for mental illness, obesity, crime, and all the other impacts of inequality. To assert that an abstract quantifier like GDP outweighs all the harms from an increase in inequality simply misunderstands the nature of human well-being and happiness.RebuttalPro defers his defense of 'innovation and the gains of trade' until R4. This deprives me of a rebuttal in R3, which is both unfair and a violation of Pro's requirements in R1. With three days per round, Pro effectively gets nine days to write his defense while I only get three days to respond. Timing matters. Six extra days of research and polish increases the quality of one's arguments significantly. Pro gets an unfair structural advantage because of that. If Pro had no intention of addressing my rebuttal until R4, the debate should have been structured to limit rebuttals to R3 and R4. Instead, Pro required rebuttal in R2. Not addressing that rebuttal until R4 is abusive towards that requirement. Pro says he 'ran out of time.' But that's not an excuse. Everyone must balance time. R1 states: 'you must make sure that there are no things in your schedule that would potentially prevent you from completing every round.' Yet Pro couldn't complete his round because he 'ran out of time.' Punish him for that.Sources in the comments and reposted in R4.</t>

    <t>I'll start with my arguments and then do a rebuttal.Free trade poses an existential threat to human survival97% of climate scientists agree that humans are causing global warming. [1] Climate change harms agriculture, human health, ecosystems, water supplies, and the economy. [2] If greenhouse gas emissions continue at their current rate, we'll soon reach a tipping point, after which runaway climate change will make the planet uninhabitable to humans. [3]Free trade is incompatible with reducing emissions, slowing climate warming, and saving our planet. Under a free trade regime, prices are set solely by supply and demand, so social costs like climate change and environmental damage aren't reflected in a good's price. Economists call these unaccounted social costs an 'externality.' Free trade is driven by prices, so if prices are wrong due to externalities, free trade will produce bad outcomes.For example, transportation costs. Free trade encourages goods to be made in one place and used very far away. The transportation costs are not only a waste of energy but they also increase the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which speeds up climate change. And, not only does free trade fail to account for carbon emissions from transportation, it also fails to account for carbon emissions from harmful production facilities, as well as radioactive waste from nuclear power, or pollution from pesticides, chemicals, and heavy metals. In fact, free trade not only permits environmental damage but encourages it, as a way to grab a cost advantage.A potential solution is a small, uniform tariff for all imports. This would encourage local production, thereby avoiding an enormous amount of wasted energy in transportation. Another idea is a carbon tax; the US could penalize imports of fossil fuels and other harmful energy-intensive industries. This would help discourage greenhouse gas emissions and encourage clean production facilities and renewable energy sources.Free trade is unsustainableFree trade lets the US import more than it exports (i.e. deficit trading). To make up the difference, the US must assume debt. As a result, foreign countries own over $30 trillion in US assets, and the US net international investment position is -$5.445 trillion. [4] The harm to the economy is huge. In 2001, the Economic Strategy Institute estimated that deficit trading shaves at least one percent per year off our economic growth. [5] Economist William Bahr estimates that our trade deficit since 1991 has made our economy 13% smaller than it otherwise would be. [6] Other economists estimate that trade deficits have stunted GDP growth by up to 20%. [4] And trade deficits also destroy jobs (e.g. trade deficits with China cost the US 2.8 million jobs between 2001 and 2008). [7] Free trade increases economic inequalityThe Stolper-Samuelson theorem, an underlying mechanism of free-market economics, says that freer trade raises returns to the abundant facctor of production and lowers returns to the scarce once. [11] In the US, the abundant factor is capital and the scarce one is labor. Thus, according to the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, free trade increases economic inequality. [12] [13] The jobs that suffer most are those that are easily traded for cheap labor abroad. This primarily impacts low-skill workers, who either lose their job or get paid less. Of course, that means free trade hurts most Americans, as most American work the sorts of blue-collar jobs that are easily traded. So we're talking about a massive impact here: a minority gets richer (and these are folks who are already rich), while the vast majority gets poorer. This is unfair. Making an extra $10,000 will improve the well-being of a middle-class family more than losing $10,000 will reduce the well-being of a billionaire. Given that fact, it makes no sense to redistribute wealth to the rich through free trade. Besides, inequality contributes to mental illness, drug abuse, obesity, and teenage pregnancy. It fosters crime and vioelence. It lowers life expectancy. And it's been shown to harm trust and community life, and overall child well-being. [14] [15] This explains why the US has so many problems with drug abuse, crime, imprisonment, and obesity when compared with other countries, since the US is so unequal. There's no other explanation. And the case against economic inequality isn't just based on social impacts. New OECD analysis has found a 'negative and statistically significant correlation' between income inequality and economic growth. [16] In other words, inequality also slows economic growth.RebuttalInnovation. Pro says free trade increases innovation. But the evidence shows otherwise; free trade harms innovation. [8] Pro's argument rests on the false assumption that more competition necessarily means more innovation. But economists have found the opposite: after a certain point, more competition reduces innovation! [9] [10] Less competition means less market uncertainty, which gives companies more confidence to invest in innovative Ramp;D. Pro underestimates the role that market stability and market concentration plays in innovation. This has led economists to say that the relationship between competition and innovation is an inverted U-shape. In other words, competition only increases innovation up to a certain point, after which more competition actually harms innovation. [8] cites empirical data showing that free trade harms innovation; economic theory cited in [9] and [10] supports this result.Lower prices. Pro says free trade lowers prices. But what Pro misunderstands is that free trade affects relative prices, not the price level (the latter being affected by macro and monetary factors). Free trade lowers the relative price of imports; by necessity, the relative price of exports must go up. Thus, consumers only benefit from free trade if they buy more imports than exports. That's not something we can rely on, as many consumers prefer exported goods rather than imported goods (e.g. in Argentina, most consumers eat mostly beef, which also happens to be Argentina's biggest export). Pro's own sources clearly state their limitation to imports.Economic growth. Pro's argument rests on the mistaken theory of comparative advantage. Comparative advantage is the idea that it's beneficial to import some goods (including services) in order to free up our workforce to produce more-valuable goods instead. The theory doesn't work because it assumes workers move easily between industries. If workers can't move, imports won't push a nation's economy into industries better suited to its comparative advantage. Instead, imports will just kill off existing industries and leave nothing in its place. Many workers don't have the skills or don't live in the right place to move between industries. Free trade will leave these workers unemployed. This problem is compounded because of at-will employment and relatively low minimum wage in the US. The result is folks with PhDs in physics making minimum wage because they can't find a better job. In effect, free trade leads to both less jobs and lower wages. The human cost is obvious but there's an economic one as well: when skills that cost money to acquire (e.g. physics) aren't used, the economy loses large investments in human capital. These losses put the whole economy at risk. Nobel laureate James Tobin put it this way: 'it takes a heap of Harberger triangles to fill an Okun gap.' A Harberger triangle is the area in a supply and demand diagram that measures the loss of taxation (i.e. the benefits of free trade). An Okun gap is the loss in output and employment when the economy falls below potential. Tobin's point is that the benefits of free trade are tiny compared to the huge cost of running our economy below full capacity due to imports and lost jobs. Other benefits. Pro also lists a host of other benefits that supposedly follow from free trade. But these 'benefits' are bare assertions. Pro doesn't actually offer any evidence/argument about these benefits. There's simply no link between these 'benefits' and 'free trade.'A final point. Free trade creates win-lose situations. Consumers enjoy lower prices on imported goods, but the relative price of exports goes up. And as a result, workers lose their jobs, and get paid less. Given that consumers and workers are ultimately the same people, there's no way to determine whether these consumers/workers gain more than they lose. No theorem in economics guarantees that the gains of consumers from lower prices on imports outweighs the loss of workers (and higher prices on exports, and lower wages).</t>

    <t>'If greenhouse gas emissions continue at their current rate, we'll soon reach a tipping point, after which runaway climate change will make the planet uninhabitable to humans.'  You claim that greenhouse gas emissions usage, if continued at this rate, would like to runaway climate change that would make this planet uninhabitable. I will grant you the argument that greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to make the planet uninhabitable. I disagree with the idea that gas emissions would continue at our current rate.   Free Trade is Beneficial to the Environment  'Free trade is incompatible with reducing emissions, slowing climate warming, and saving our planet. Under a free trade regime, prices are set solely by supply and demand, so social costs like climate change and environmental damage aren't reflected in a good's price. Economists call these unaccounted social costs an 'externality.' Free trade is driven by prices, so if prices are wrong due to externalities, free trade will produce bad outcomes.'  You provide no sources that demonstrate that free trade is incompatible with reducing emissions and slowing global warming. Negative externalities do result from fossil fuel usage in the form of greenhouse gasses and pollution, but that doesn't mean artificially increasing the price of energy consumption to try to make the price 'right' would actually benefit society.   On the contrary, there is evidence that free trade actually benefits the environment. One study found that 'Our estimates of the scale and technique elasticities indicate that, if openness to international markets raises both output and income by 1 percent, pollution concentrations fall by approximately 1 percent. Putting this calculation together with our earlier evidence on composition effects yields a somewhat surprising conclusion with regard to sulfur dioxide: freer trade is good for the environment. Free trade would also benefit the environment because it facilitates the spread of more efficient and greener technologies. A World Bank study found that 'Access to climate-friendly clean energy technologies is especially important for the fast-growing developing economies. Within the context of the current global trade regime, the study finds that a removal of tariffs and NTBs for four basic clean energy technologies (wind, solar, clean coal, and efficient lighting) in 18 of the high-GHG-emitting developing countries will result in trade gains of up to 13 percent. If translated into emissions reductions, these gains suggest that—even within a small subset of clean energy technologies and for a select group of countries—the impact of trade liberalization could be reasonably substantial.' 'For example, transportation costs.'  Sure, there are transportation emissions, but the alternative is worse.   'A potential solution is a small, uniform tariff for all imports. This would encourage local production, thereby avoiding an enormous amount of wasted energy in transportation. Another idea is a carbon tax; the US could penalize imports of fossil fuels and other harmful energy-intensive industries. This would help discourage greenhouse gas emissions and encourage clean production facilities and renewable energy sources.' This proposal to reduce carbon emissions is flawed. First off, tariffs would lead to an inefficient allocation of resources in society due to the loss of comparative advantage. Losing efficiency means more waste and higher emissions from inefficient production. The carbon tax is a regressive tax that burdens poor people the most, would increase the cost of living for everyone, lead to less economic growth, and would not affect oil consumption greatly unless the tax is set enormously high, due to the inelastic demand for oil.   The better solution to facilitate the advancement of alternative energy sources is to decrease regulations that prevent business growth, increase free trade to facilitate the expansion of green technologies, and allow the free market to continue developing alternative energy sources.   Free trade is not incompatible with the reducing carbon emissions. Free trade will lead to the reduction of carbon emissions.  Free trade is Sustainable 'Free trade lets the US import more than it exports (i.e. deficit trading). To make up the difference, the US must assume debt. As a result, foreign countries own over $30 trillion in US assets, and the US net international investment position is -$5.445 trillion. [4]'   International investment isn't equivalent to free trade. Free trade is the lack of tariffs and barriers in the transaction of goods and services in the economy. Investing  involves buying and holding stocks, bonds, and mutual funds to achieve a profit later. Tariffs don't directly apply to US international investment.   But while we're on the topic of sustainability, it has been proven time and again that protectionism hurts the economy and is unsustainable.  A famous example of protectionism at work is the Smoot-Hawley Bill. The Smoot-Hawley Bill was a bill that drastically increased tariffs to try to protect American works, but it ended up backfiring and hurting out economy. 'U.S. imports from Europe declined from a 1929 high of $1,334 million to just $390 million in 1932, while U.S. exports to Europe fell from $2,341 million in 1929 to $784 million in 1932. Overall, world trade declined by some 66% between 1929 and 1934. More generally, Smoot-Hawley did nothing to foster trust and cooperation among nations in either the political or economic realm during a perilous era in international relations. Free trade increases the standards of living of the poor  'The Stolper-Samuelson theorem, an underlying mechanism of free-market economics, says that freer trade raises returns to the abundant facctor of production and lowers returns to the scarce once. [11] In the US, the abundant factor is capital and the scarce one is labor. Thus, according to the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, free trade increases economic inequality. [12] [13] The jobs that suffer most are those that are easily traded for cheap labor abroad. This primarily impacts low-skill workers, who either lose their job or get paid less. Of course, that means free trade hurts most Americans, as most American work the sorts of blue-collar jobs that are easily traded. So we're talking about a massive impact here: a minority gets richer (and these are folks who are already rich), while the vast majority gets poorer. ' Free trade has overall helped poor Americans. Yes, some types of jobs have been lost, but overall poor Americans are better off with free trade than without.   One example is how free trade helps job growth. The Heritage Foundation found that, 'Today, the $12 trillion U.S. economy is bolstered by free Trade, a pillar of America's vitality. In 2005, U.S. exports to the rest of the world totaled $1.2 trillion and supported one in five U.S. manufacturing jobs. jobs directly linked to the export of goods pay 13 percent to 18 percent more than other U.S. jobs.' Also, 'The average U.S. tariff rate on all goods has fallen from over 19 percent in 1933 to 1.8 percent in 2004. As a percentage of GDP, the importance of Trade in the economy has climbed from single digits in the 1930s to nearly one-quarter of U.S. GDP in 2004. At the same time that Trade has become freer, real per capita GDP in the U.S. (in constant 2000 dollars) has climbed from a low of $5,061 in 1933 to about $36,000 in 2004.'  Average wages have substantially increased for every single income percentile since the start of trade liberalization. Economic inequality may have increased over time, but the free market isn't a zero-sum game. Free trade benefits every that takes part in the market, rich or poor. I'd rather have economic inequality and increased standards of living for the poor, than having everyone be more equal, but poorer. As I have ran out of time, I will be discussing and defending my arguments for innovation and the gains of trade next round.</t>

    <t>Free Trade Increases Innovation and Efficiency The first reason one should support free trade is because open trade with other countries leads to maximized innovation and efficiency in the economy.  The reason why there is more innovation in a free market is because businesses are forced to compete against each other on an equal playing field, which means they have to come up with ways to outcompete their competition. This results in businesses and individuals creating and employing new ideas to decrease their expenses (such as replacing a component of a machine with a cheaper material), increase the quality of their goods/services (such as making a food product taste better), and create more efficient methods to create and employ the goods/services (such as making an efficient website to ease purchases of a product).     Free Trade Lowers the Cost of Goods and Services  One of the best reasons to support free trade is the fact that it lowers the cost of  living for everyone. This happens because of the competition that I mentioned above. When companies compete without the distortion of tariffs, they are forced to provide the cheapest price possible in order to remain competitive and generate revenue.   For proof, we can look at multiple studies that prove this to be true. One study found that 'the results of a panel covering 325 manufacturing industries from 1997 to 2006 show that imports from nine low-wage countries are associated with strong downward pressure on prices. When these nations capture a 1% share of the U.S. sector, the sector's producer prices decrease by 2.35%' (1)  The graph below shows how imports effect the US methanol market. (2)Free Trade Leads to Economic Growth  The term used to describe the efficiency increases as a result of free trade is called the gains of trade. Below is a graph to help visualize how the gains of trade works.(3)Or another way to look at it, one can analyze how tariffs effect the supply of a product in the graph below.(4) Other Benefits Other benefits of Free trade include: (5)  Enhances the domestic competitiveness Takes advantage of international trade technology Increase sales and profits Extend sales potential of the existing products Maintain cost competitiveness in your domestic market Enhance potential for expansion of your business Gains a global market share Reduce dependence on existing markets Stabilize seasonal market fluctuations. </t>

    <t>Pro is obviously trolling, but since it wasn't clarified that this was a troll debate then I have no choice but to take this seriously. On that note, let's examine Pro's case. It is filled with bare assertion fallacies, non-sequiturs and personal bias that in no way actually fulfills the BoP that Pro holds.Happiness1. Pro claims that charity has been wildly ineffective. However, his reasoning for this isn't sufficient. Of course there is still hunger and crime existent, but charity work has reduced that and has helped the cause by showing. Bill Gates, founder of an effective world charity, dispels the myth that foreign aid is a big waste. He states that because of help from other countries, 'by 2035, there will be almost no poor countries left in the world.' He gives examples of how foreign has benefited third-world countries such as that a vaccine campaign in southern Africa eliminated measles as a killer of children. Polio has been mostly wiped from the world and is only prevalent in the countries of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria.[1]2. The assertion that video games cause happiness is both subjective and unfounded. Most hildren in Africa don't even have access game consoles, and there's no way to determine that they would become 'happier' from playing it versus being cured of malaria and taken out of poverty which charity is working to do.3. Fallout 4 has not even been released yet, so it is complete speculation to say it will cause happiness. It's release date is thought to be sometime in November 2015 Culture1. Just because Fallout 4 is supposedly about nuclear war doesn't mean future generations will dislike war in the future....again, unfounded assumption and complete lack of evidence.2. Not everyone will be 'too busy' to cause climate change because we don't know how many people will abandon their important jobs to play the game. It could be a huge failure for all we know.3. Violence and unwanted pregnancies aren't going to decrease. Not everyone will be playing it, and we certainly don't know how many will. Same reasoning as above.4. Mod tools do not increase intelligence. Unsubstantiated claim.5. Jobs may or may not be created. No way to know for sure, and even if there is it cannot compare to charity work.World peace1. Pro asserts that everyone will be united by Fallout 4 but this argument is completely theoretical. Pro is wishing this would happen, but gives no reason for us to believe that it actually will.2. The rest of this argument is so ridiculous it's not worthy of a response. Everything Pro says will happen is 100% unsupported, thus should be dismissed.</t>

<h>I would like to thank Kryptic for accepting this debate.Correlation and CausationConsider the Cenozoic era (the last 65 million years). Overall, solar activity increased 0.4% over this period. 'Because Earth absorbs about 240 W/m^2 of solar energy, that brightness increase is a forcing of about 1 W/m^2. This small linear increase of forcing, by itself, would have caused a modest global warming through the Cenozoic Era.' The CO2 levels caused a much higher forcing. In contrast, atmospheric CO2 during the Cenozoic changed from at least 1000 ppm in the early Cenozoic to as small as 170 ppm during recent ice ages. The resulting climate forcing, as can be computed accurately for this CO2 range using formulae in Table 1 of Hansen et al. (2000), exceeds 10 W/m^2. It is clear that CO2 was the dominant climate forcing in the Cenozoic.'[1]In fact, the temperature changes correspond to the CO2 changes. '...there is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr.'[2]This graph shows the CO2-temperature correlation over the last 700,000 years: Excess CO2 traps heat. Considering the recent global warming, satellites measure less heat escaping out to space, at the particular wavelengths that CO2 absorbs heat, thus finding '...direct experimental evidence for a significant increase in the Earth's greenhouse effect.' In other words, the Earth is retaining more of the heat that it receives from the sun that it received from before. This excess heat manifests itself through global temperature increases.'If less heat is escaping to space, where is it going? Back to the Earth's surface. Surface measurements confirm this, observing more downward infrared radiation. A closer look at the downward radiation finds moreheat returning at CO2 wavelengths,leadin to the conclusion that '...this experimental data should effectively end the argument by skeptics that no experimental evidence exists for the connection between greenhouse gas increases in the atmosphere and global warming.''[3][4][5]Evidence of Mankind's Influence on the Recent Global Warming TrendIt would be rather coincidental if the recent rise in global warming happened to start just around the time that humans started to emit large quantities of greenhouse gases. However, there is direct evidence as well, in addition to the already established correlation between temperature and CO2.Now, it is known that CO2 levels are increasing. 'In pre-industrial times over the last 10,000 years, CO2 was relatively stable at around 275 to 285 parts per million. Over the last 250 years, atmospheric CO2 levels have increased by about 100 parts per million.' CO2 levels are increasing at a level not seen in at least 500,000 years, if not longer.[6]Here is a graph showing CO2 concentrations over the last 10000 years: [7][8]Now, carbon has several isotopes, three of which are C12, C13, and C14. C14 is radioactive, and has a half life of around 5,730 years. The CO2 emissions that humans make come from fossil fuels. Thus, if humans were the cause of the excess CO2, we'd except the C14/C12 ratio to decline, because, while there is a relatively constant amount of C14 in the atmosphere due to continuous replenishment (when a neutron collides with a regular nitrogen atom, a C14 atom and a proton result), the amount of C14 in the Earth has steadily decreased because it is not replenished, and since fossil fuels come from the ground, almost pure C12 is being ejected into the atmosphere. Indeed, it is observed that the C14/C12 ratio has declined. And thus, if humans were the cause of the excess CO2, we'd except the C13/C12 ratio to decline, because plants find it easier to take in carbon dioxide with a C12 atom than one with a C13 atom, implying that plants have a lower C13/C12 ratio than the atmopshere and, since animals eat plants (either by directly eating then or eating something that eats plants), also implying that fossils also have a lower C13/C12 ratio than the atmopshere, implying that we'd see a decline in the C13/C12 ratio as well. Indeed it is also observed that the C13/C12 ratio has declined.[9][10][11]This can be observed in the graph below (this is the C13/C12 ratio over the last 650 years; the C14/C12 ratio graph was too big to put in the debate):The evidence that this excess CO2 is the cause of the recent global warming is voluminous. One piece of evidence is a comparison of warming in the troposphere and stratosphere. Because the CO2 is in the upper troposphere, the troposphere temperature would increase, while the stratospheric temperature would decrease, because there would be less heat reaching the stratosphere. 'Computer model estimates of the ‘human influence’ fingerprint are broadly similar to the observed pattern. In sharp contrast, model simulations of internal and total natural variability cannot produce the same sustained, large-scale warming of the troposphere and cooling of the stratosphere.'[4][12][13]This graph shows this: [4]Another piece of evidence is the frequency of cold days and nights. Because the sun only shines in the day time, is the sun was causing global warming, the days would warm faster than the nights, while if greenhouse gases were causing global warming, this wouldn't be observed. It is the latter's prediction that is observed. 'What we observe is a decrease in cold nights greater than the decrease in cold days, and an increase in warm nights greater than the increase in warm days.'[4][14]This can be shown in the below graph: [4]Overall, the evidence shows that human-emitted greenhouse gases are the cause of global warming. CO2, in addition to other gases like methane and nitrous oxide are being emitted by humans in very large amounts, and this is manifesting itself in an increase in the average global temperature.Climate Sensitivity and FeedbacksClimate sensitivity is the amount the temperature would rise if the CO2 concentration were doubled. Obviously, if there's a large climate sensitivity, then increases in CO2 have large effect. It is known that the climate sensitivity is around 1 degree C. However, this can be amplified through feedbacks. Positive ones amplify the sensitivity, while negative ones diminish the sensitivity. The evidence overwhelmingly comes down on the former, that positive feedbacks are happening. Increases in CO2 cause temperature increases, which are amplified by water vapor and the effect on clouds.'Since the radiative effects associated with the buildup of water vapor to near-saturation levels and the subsequent condensation into clouds are far stronger than the equilibrium level of radiative forcing by the non-condensing GHGs, this results in large local fluctuations in temperature about the global equilibrium value.'[15]This can be shown in the below graph: Further, increases in CO2 affect the carbon cycle in this way:Global warming can result in the death of vegetation (due to droughts) and the warming of the ocean. Both of these further reduce the maximum absorption of the Earths carbon cycle, thus resulting in even more CO2 being released into the atmosphere. And with this, CO2 increases even more. In other words, CO2-caused temperature increases are amplified by positive feedbacks and the mechanics of the carbon cycle.So, the positive feedback amplifies the climate sensitivity. How much it is amplified can be determined through study. Using a Bayesian statistical approach, which is “the dominant [method] in the literature”, these findings support the notion of climate sensitivity as maximum 4 degrees C, a mean of 3 degrees C, and likely not lower than 3 degrees.[16]The graph below gives a statistical analysis:[17]The mean is around 3 degrees C. The CO2 that humans emit thus has an effect of 3 degrees C per doubling of CO2. This can be shown by the fact that CO2 concentrations have increased from around 275 ppm to around 400 ppm. This is an increase of around 40%. This should manifest itself with a temperature increase of a little less than 1.5 degrees C. Indeed, temperatures have increased around this amount over the last 150 years. The anthropogenic-forcing climate models thus match observations.[18]In other words, in addition to the direct evidence of how the Earth is warming, the climate models based on a greenhouse gas cause to global warming explain almost perfectly the recent global warming. This is a lot of evidence for a human case to the recent global warming.ConclusionGreenhouse gases cause global warming because of their heat trapping abilities. Humans have been emitting vast amounts of greenhouse gases over the last 150 years, and this shows itself on the CO2 measurements. The atmospheric warming pattern and greater heating at night are evidence that the recent global warming is caused by those human emitted greenhouse gases. These increases are amplified through the water vapor and cloud positive feedbacks and the positive feedback that arises through the climate cycle. The climate sensitivity ends up being around 3 degrees C. Finally, the CO2-temperature record shows that the two correlate with remarkable correlation.SourcesSources in comments.</h>

    <t>I would like to thank Kryptic for presenting his argument.I agree with the alternate definition he provided. Looking back to the definition I cited in round 1, I defined global warming as '...the average temperature of Earth's atmosphere and oceans since the late 19th century, and its projected continuation.' This means that any arguments regarding natural factors' effects on the climate before the late 19th century and long term climate projection of there being another ice age are irrelevant. I'm not contending that natural factors have no effect on the climate, or even that they are not usually the only cause of climate change. All I'm arguing is that the global warming since the late 19th century has been driven mostly by anthropogenic forcings.[1]Since my opponent provided no other arguments, all I will do in this round is show how comparing natural factors and anthropogenic factors shows that humans are the main cause of global warming.The most important of the natural climate forcings is the sun. It is the source of the Earth's energy. This energy comes from the radiation emitted as a result of fusion reactions at the core of the sun. This radiation is known as the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI). Any change in the TSI causes energy imbalances on the Earth. This energy imbalance can be calculated using the formula below:Delta means change, so Delta(F) means the change in energy (i.e. energy imbalance) and Delta(TSI) means the change in solar irradiance. The 0.7 factor comes from the fact that the Earth reflects about 30% of the solar radiation it receives, and the 1/4 factor comes from spherical geometry.Changes in temperature are proportional to the energy imbalance. This can be expressed in the formula below:Lambda is the constant of proportionality, representing the climate sensitivity (discussed in my first argument) in this case.The only thing that's left is to actually determine the values. First, the change in TSI (in this case, between 1900 and 1950). 'Although Wang, Lean, and Sheeley's reconstructionputs the change in TSIsince 1900 at about 0.5 W-m-2, previous studies have shown a larger change, so we'll estimate the change in TSI at 0.5 to 2 W-m-2.' This corresponds to an energy imbalance of around 0.1-0.35 W-m-2. Next, the lambda factor. I explained in the last article that the statistically most probable value for the climate sensitivity was around 3 degrees C. But, there was a lot of variation. 'Studies have given a possible range of values of 2 to 4.5°C warming for a doubling of CO2, which corresponds to a range of 0.54 to 1.2°C/(W-m-2) for λ.' This gives range of values from 0.05 to 0.4 degrees C, with a most probable value of 0.15 degrees C (corresponding to the statistically most likely climate sensitivity). In other words, solar activity from 1900 to 1950 raised the temperature of the Earth 0.15 degrees C.[2]Looking at the effect of CO2 emissions over that same period, humans increased the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere by about 20 parts per million, giving a range of values of 0.14-0.32 degrees C for the effect of that emission on the climate, with the most probable being 0.22 degrees C.[2]This corresponds to CO2 amounting for 60% of the warming from 1900-1950. After that, it gets higher. CO2 emissions rise exponentally, and changes in the TSI start getting less positive, and eventually become negative after 1975. 'Therefore, the solar forcing combined with theanthropogenicCO2forcing and other minor forcings (such as decreased volcanic activity) can account for the 0.4°C warming in the early 20th century, with the solar forcing accounting for about 40% of the total warming. Over the past century, this increase inTSIis responsible for about 15-20% of global warming. But sinceTSIhasn't increased in at least the past 32 years (and more like 60 years, based onreconstructions), the Sun is not directly responsible for the warming over that period.' Solar activity cannot account for the warming after 1975, and even before that was a smaller factor than CO2.[2]This can be shown in the image below:[3]CO2 correlates with CO2 more than solar activity, especially after 1975.There are other natural forcings, ozone concentrations and volcanic activity being the other major ones. The ozone layer of the atmosphere blocks the sun's UV radiation from reaching the Earth. Lowering levels of ozone may cause warming then by allowing more solar radiation to reach the Earth. However, while ozone levels were decreasing before 1995, they are now increasing (regardless, the declining ozone levels were also caused by humans). And the volcanic activity forcing has actually had a cooling effect on the climate. 'Foster and Rahmstorf (2011) used a multiple linear regression approach to filter out the effects of volcanic andsolar activity, and the El NiñoSouthern Oscillation(ENSO). They found that volcanic activity, as measured by aerosol optical thickness data (AOD) has only caused between 0.02 and 0.04°C per decade warming from 1979 through 2010 (Table 1, Figure 2), or about 0.06 to 0.12°C warming of the surface and lowertroposphere, repsectively, since 1979 (out of approximately 0.5°C observed surface warming).'[4]In total, all the forcings, both natural and anthropogenic, can be shown below:[3]Greenhouse gases are far more important than solar activity (note that sulfate levels mostly correlate with volcanic activity).ConclusionI don't have anything more to say, since this is all my opponent talks about. Anthropogenic forcings were more important for global warming than natural forcings. </t>

    <t>I will be debating against (Con) the idea that 'Mankind Is the Main Cause of Global Warming', I do not doubt that we are a huge factor in this, however I am arguing that we are not the leading cause of Global Warming, or known better recently as, Climate Change.I would like to start talking about what Climate Change is.- a change in global or regional climate patterns, in particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onwards and attributed largely to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels.This is the typical definition of Climate Change for the public, the use of fossil fuels and other carbon based structures that inevitably end up in the atmosphere, making a greenhouse effect and holding in more heat. My argument is, ~ Humans and natural cycles is why we have Climate Change ~Each year through our generation of electricity through coal [4], our consumption of petrol and oil and exhaust of our transportation [3], our destruction of natural filters such as plant life, phytoplankton [1] and bodies of water [2] have made our world a slightly different place that will radically change in the near future.The science behind the principle of Climate Change is what we want to know. How does Climate Change work?If we look at the moon, the temperatures vary from -170C to 100C [5], however, on Earth we have a stronger gravity, this pulls our gaseous atmosphere closer to our planet through its mass. Gravity is a force and puts pressure on everything it can affect, as a result, everything becomes heavier; this means that the centrifugal force also applies more pressure due to the rotation of the axis [6]. Since our atmosphere is a lot closer and denser then the moons atmosphere, heat is locked in.The question now is, how the atmosphere correlates to increased heat. In order for our atmosphere to absorb radiation, it must have some electrically charged particles for passing electromagnetic waves to push around. Although most of the gasses in our atmosphere don't have a negative charge, instead, they have an equal distribution between both negative and positive charges. However, there is one good part about the placement of polarity, Water (H20), Ozone (O3) and Nitrous Oxide (N2O) which all have their negatively charged particles on one side allowing infrared radiation to absorb and reflect easily.[7]Carbon Dioxide (C02) and Methane (CH4) move and shake continuously allowing the same result as the previous three elements. [8]As a result, having these gasses enables more heat to be held together leading to hotter days. I will not be going into Ozone Depletion however I will be going into how the real reason we have climate change is due to our oceans.Opening statement.The human use of elements that promote the greenhouse effect on the world has created a slight discourse in the typical cycles that would otherwise naturally occur. The waters are getting hotter, rising, and expelling carbon dioxide instead of holding it in, this has occurred in the past naturally without human intervention, the natural filters are being removed and as a result, more carbon dioxide is entering our atmosphere enabling Climate Change. This is the man made climate change that will affect the patterns of temperature cycles that have been happening for the last 4.5 billion years. Mankind is affecting the part of repair or restoration within natural filters. If we look at graphs that are 542 million years ago, we can see a general pattern, we are about to go into a cold spell soon too. The next ice age is on its way. Currently I have no option to upload the graph so I will post it in the reference. I do apologise for my incredibly short argument, it’s really late, and I did not have much time to work on this. I will finish my argument, address your rebuttals and complete round 2 and 3 off successfully in the next round. Thank you.Kryptic.</t>
<h>    I will be debating against (Con) the idea that 'Mankind Is the Main Cause of Global Warming', I do not doubt that we are a huge factor in this, however I am arguing that we are not the leading cause of Global Warming, or known better recently as, Climate Change.I would like to start talking about what Climate Change is.- a change in global or regional climate patterns, in particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onwards and attributed largely to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels.This is the typical definition of Climate Change for the public, the use of fossil fuels and other carbon based structures that inevitably end up in the atmosphere, making a greenhouse effect and holding in more heat.</h>

    <t>C1) Climate sensitivity is likely high  Climate sensitivity is the key argument to this debate. Everyone agrees that CO2 has some direct effect, at least 1 degree C per doubling of CO2 concentration. This is what former climate modeler turned skeptic David Evans argues. “[All] serious skeptical scientists have always agreed with the government climate scientists about the direct effect of CO2. The argument is entirely about the feedbacks.” [1]  What are feedbacks? Feedbacks are important because they tell us how much warming we will have in the future. They amplify -- or dampen -- the warming effect of CO2. Changes in albedo, cloud cover, water vapor, and greenage can all affect warming.  If sensitivity is 2-3 degrees C, CO2 can explain most of the warming since the late 70s. If it is lower it still causes a significant amount. My opponent needs to pretty much argue that the amplification effects are under one in order to win.   Let us assume that climate sensitivity is low. Say, feedbacks are around zero (no positive or negative feedbacks);  every doubling of CO2 leads to roughly 1.1 degrees C increase in temperature. Even this unrealistically low climate sensitivity does not harm the AGW hypothesis. Nir Al Shaviv, a skeptical physicist, wrote a paper assuming the feedback effect was 1.1 degrees. He calculated that CO2 actually caused slightly over half of the modern warming trend [2] (about 57%). The famous Lindzen and Choi (and Spencer) results are really the only ones which cast doubt on the fact that CO2 is responsible for the warming. But Nir Al Shaviv told me in an email, “[m]y best estimate is that the sensitivity is higher than Lindzen and Choi, actually closed to no net amplifier, with the 50% of the CO2 doubling, the Anthropogenic contribution is also around 50%.” [3] Essentially, he verified what I sent to him in an email with calculations I had done assuming the amplifier was flat. My data found that it caused about 49.5% of the warming, but I failed to take into account the logarithmic effect of CO2, which makes the effect over 50%.   Even then, these assumptions are incorrect. Sensitivity is higher, and if it is, CO2 pretty much causes far more than 50% of the warming, but both estimates are enough to win me the debate. Research by Patrick Michaels, now a libertarian, CATO scholar found the amplifier to be 1.6 degrees C [4]. More than the 1.1 above. This puts the man made contribution to global warming above 50%, and certainly above 57%. This is not even including other gases which amplify the greenhouse effect.   The burgeoning evidence suggests that the net amplifier is around 2-3 degrees C. Based on multiple lines of evidence, stemming from volcanic eruptions, instrumental records, paleoclimatology, and more, the mean sensitivity sits firmly at about 3 degrees C. The following picture demonstrates the evidence.     As seen, the average never dips below 2 degrees C. The mean is 2 - 4.5 degrees C, all of which are enough for me to win the debate. 2 degrees C probably puts you around 70% of the warming is due to CO2, and 3 at nearly 100%, though I have not done the math (yet…). Some studies find fairly high sensitivity, around 4 degrees C. JD Annan, a leading climatologist, uses a Bayesian statistical technique, the predominant methodology in both the skeptic and realist literature. He found a mean sensitivity of 3 degrees C, with upper estimates at 4 degrees C, though still possible, but very unlikely below 3 degrees C [5].   The following graph [6], which I like because since I have used it pretty much everyone else has stolen it, shows the results from 3 leading studies. Although the results are uncertain, they are certain in that sensitivity is above 2 degrees C.     A new paper, published in 2012, actually went against the consensus and found low sensitivity. Despite this, their results concluded that “[h]umanity is . . . responsible for the most recent period of warming from 1976 to 2010.” [7]  Sensitivity is high. That means I win the debate. If it is low, I still win the debate because it caused 50% of more of the modern warm period.   C2) Evidence from paleoclimatology   I love paleoclimatology. I like geology and come from a family of geologists who are also oil entrepenueres (maybe why I still have skeptic leanings). And pretty solid evidence in the paleoclimatological record actually shows a strong CO2 effect. I am just going to c/p my debate with Roy.   There is significant evidence from paleoclimate records that CO2 can have an effect on changes in the climate. Climate skeptic and paleoclimatologist Bob Carter emphasizes the importance of paleoclimate data. He compares climate to a piece of string. The current instrumental data (1850 – present) is a very short period of time, according to Carter. And when the ‘string’ is lengthened, we see a lot of climactic variability. Instead of looking at the recent past, we should look at the entire temperature record in order to get an accurate picture of the climate [8]. I will provide evidenc, contrary to what Carter believes, lengthening the string supports AGW theory.  Over the Cenozoic Era, which began 66 million years ago, we see clear warming and cooling cycles caused by changes in CO2 concentrations. The sun increased slightly over that time period, whereas temperatures cooled. CO2, however, fell steadily through that time period. Plate tectonics was also accounted for. With natural forcings an unlikely cause, “CO2 was the dominant climate forcing in the Cenozoic” [9].  When you lengthen the ‘string’ over the course of the entire Phanerozoic (500 million years; begins at the Cambrian) there is still evidence of CO2 driving multiple climate changes. The GEOCARB study, published in 2001, is one of the definitive proxy records for CO2 concentrations within the last 500 million years. The study notes that “over the long term there is indeed a correlation between CO2 and paleotemperature” [10].  Evidence from the Vostok ice cores (specifically 240,000 before present), proves that CO2 has had an effect on temperatures. Although the initial forcing was orbital changes in the sun, CO2 “plays . . . a key role in amplifying the initial orbital forcing” and “the CO2 increase clearly precedes the Northern Hemisphere deglaciation”. The study also notes that these forcings “are also at work for the present-day and future climate” [11].  There is also proof that it is warmer now than it has been since the MWP. In fact, it is warmer now than any year since 1400 AD [12]. Newer reconstructions continue to support this finding, and even extends the dataset. It finds that the Roman warm period (RWP) and the MWP as much cooler than today, and claims to have replicated previous ‘hockey stick’ studies [19]. The results are depicted below.    Looking into the geologic past, we see strong evidence in favor of the idea that carbon dioxide can increase temperature. It logically follows that if humans continue to emit CO2, and other greenhouse gasses, that human emissions will increase temperatures.  C3) Consensus  Before I continue, I would like to note this argument in and of itself does not prove that global warming is caused by man. Actual evidence should be the driving force behind this debate. The reason I chose to put this in my argument is simple: the science is not clear because of consensus, but a consensus exists because the evidence is clear. This evidence will be discussed later.  A study published in Science reviewed the ISI web of science in order to take a survey of relevant climate literature as to what the causes of climate change are. The study failed to find a single paper which was in opposition to the consensus position, that the main driver of climate change is anthropogenic. 75% of the papers supported the consensus position, whereas 25% had no position (they were focused on things other than forgings, like impacts or paleoclimate) [14]. The study also noted how many organizations have come out supporting the idea of anthropogenic climate change. The IPCC, the American Meteorological Society, American Geophysical Union, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science have all concluded that the evidence for AGW is overwhelming [15].  NASA furthers this argument, noting “most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position”. They also argue “[n]inety-seven percent of climate scientists agree that climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities” [16].  A 196 page report representing 13 governmental agencies, and written by 28 authors from scientific institutions, has stated “[t]he global warming of the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced increases in heat-trapping gases” [17].</t>

    <t>In R1 global warming was defined as an average increase in temperature since the late 19th century. We have caused pretty much all of the warming since 1976 and a significant percent of the pre-1940 warming, with a cooling spell between the late 40s to early 70s because of human aerosol emissions and a decline in TSI.  King’s entire argument is… paleoclimate. But I don’t have to prove that we caused warming 500 million years ago, only since around 1870 or so. Paleoclimatology does have an application in this debate: whether or not CO2 causes (or doesn’t cause) past climate changes is important. It can prove whether or not CO2 has any influence on the climate. My opponent’s conclusion — that I have to prove changes before the industrial revolution — breaks rule 6, and warrants an automatic merit loss. I will refute the case anyway, but only the relevant details:  A) Phanerozoic temperature record  King shows us a graph plotting temperature and CO2 throughout the phanerozoic eon, and tells us that there is no correlation. For at least the last few thousand years, CO2 has had a strong impact on climate [1].  Unfortunately,King’s graph uses a study which I preempted. It must be noted that the graph my opponent uses does not show the error bars, so any correlation (or non correlation) is uncertain at best. And, as I argued last round, the man who made the graph (GEOCARB; Berner 2001) actually says that there exists a long term correlation between temperature and carbon dioxide [2].  Berner’s study also fails to take into account saturation effects. When this is accounted for, the correlation between CO2 and temperature is almost perfect [3].  So, the second graph my opponent uses is blatantly incorrect. Not only do the authors of the data say that I am correct, not only do the error bars tell us that the results are not really with my opponent, but a separate analysis *improving* the methodology finds a nearly *perfect* correlation between CO2 and temperature.  B) More recent temperature changes  The graph my opponent uses seems like a sketchy-tabloid esque graph. There is no reason to trust it. The data is not so cut and dry, especially because data exists showing that temperatures are warmer — not cooler — than temperatures within the past 1000 years [4].  And the timescale king uses is cherry picked. Using the past 65 million years, CO2 is the predominant climate forcing of temperature changes [5]. Research focusing on the past few interglacials — which includes king’s graph — has concluded that CO2 “plays . . . a key role in amplifying the initial orbital forcing.” [6]  Plus, the graph king uses does not take into account other forcings. Of course other factors exist in climate — I am not arguing that CO2 is the only one, only that is can be (and is) a forcing since about 1870. Climate changes in response to whatever forcing exists at that date and time. And today, CO2 is driving climate. Just like how short term (volcanoes) and long-term (GCR fluctuations) can all affect climate, CO2 has *always* played *some* role in climate. On some timescales, it is dominant [3][4]. Merely because climate has changed for other reasons does not mean that humans have no effect. Most of the time, it is not a gun which kills a person, but it would be wrong to conclude that guns do not kill. Just because climate has changed before does not necessarily mean that our change is natural.  C) Humans have only existed for 200,000 years  So? </t>

<h>First off, THANK YOU! I am very excited to have this debate, and I hope it goes well.This debate assumes that climate change has happened over the past centuries, and that over that period of time there has been a overall increase in global temperatures. So yes, I think. Before we start I would like to present these following facts/opinion that I humbly ask my opponent and voters to count as truth in this debate. As of now, current levels of CO2 are around 400 parts per million, give or take a little. Another is that most scientists who believe in Antropogenic Warming think that global temperatures will increase by 2-4 degrees C by the end of the century. Finally, most of said Anthropogenic Global Warming is caused by release of CO2 according to most scientists who believe in this form of warming. Make any changes or additions to this list as you see fit, also while some of these are opinions I ask that in this debate we consider them truths. If you disagree please make it be known in you speech, and provide counter 'truths.' Lets Begin! Arguments that Contradict and Disprove the Idea of Anthropogenic Global Warming 18 Year Equalibrium: In this argument we will examine the fact that there has been no warming for 18 years and 4 months. (actually 6, but site is one month old)  From December 1996-March 2015 there has been no global warming as shown in the average. This really is shocking in the grand scheme of things because this proves that despite the world blasting carbon into the air, there has been no change in average temperature. This completely contradicts what Pro-antropogenic Global Warming scientists believe, meaning that they have prodicted it all incorrectly. 30000 Scientists: In this argument we look at the MASSIVE number of scientists that oppose the idea of Anthropogenic Global Warming. A petition has been cycling has aquired 31,487 scientists who reject the idea of Antropogenic Global Warming, 9,029 of those individuals have a PHD. An argument of the oppisate side is that there is a concensus amongst scientists that Global Warming is caused, but these numbers clearly destroy this notion. When we have this many scientists, especially those with PHDs, who say that global warming is not caused by human activities and any 'evidence' that says otherwise is false, you must assume that something simply is not correct with the opposing arguments. Antarctic/Arctic Ice: In this argument we will examine the fact that Antarctic Ice has hit all time records and the fact that Arctic Ice rebounded by 50% from 2012-2013.   Antarctic Ice hit its all time record in 2014, surpassing the 20 million square millimeter mark. The antarctic ice has been increasing by about 18,900 square kilometers since recording first began. Increase in this ice has been occuring for several years, and in the past few years have been making new records while Arctic Ice on the other hand has been struggling. I frankly will be the first to admit it, however I will LOUDLY proclaim the fact that it has been making comebacks. From 2012 to 2013 Arctic ice rebounded by 50%. This means that despite this 'global warming,' ice continued to increase. So basically during this time period, both the arctic and antarctic ice increased, despit increased CO2 which should have caused an increase in temperature. Even though Arctic Ice had been shrinking, the fact that it increased speaks volumes to what is really happening.   Ice Age: In this argument we will examine an ice age that occured whis CO2 levels were signifigantly higher than they are today. s://stevengoddard.files.wordpress.com...; alt='' width='640' height='404' /gt;  (this graph shows the Atmoshperic Carbon Levels and Average Global Temperatures from around 600 million years ago till today) As this graph clearly depicts that at around the 450 million year mark Earth went into a HUGE ice age. However during this time CO2 Levels were at a little more than 4000 ppm. 4000! This means that Earth was experiencing and ice age while the CO2 levels were more than 10 times what they are today. Now the fact is: if what some scientists are saying is true, and CO2 has the power to raise the temperature of the planet by 2-4 degrees by the end of century, then this simply should not have happend. The is conclusion is this: CO2 does not have an impact on global temperatures because there have been cases in past where huge opposites have occured that simply should not have happened according to opposing scientists.  Flawed Arguments of the Opposing Side  97% Consensus: This argument examines the often sited 97% consesus of scientists that believe global warming is real and is caused by human activities and is dangerous.  This study was run by one person and a couple friends who supposably read over 10,000 papers, and said that 97% endorsed the idea that global warming is human caused, and dangerous. However, a professor and 3 coauthors went back through and looked at these papers and saw that this was simply not the case. In fact, they found that only 0.3% of these papers supported the idea. Therefore we can conclude that the 97% consensus is false. The reason you believe the professor is because he is a professor. The other individual was a blogger, who to the extent of my knowledge did not have these types of credentials and could not have made better conclusions than the proffesor.   Weather:  In this argument we examine how arguments about weather are completely unjustified.  Tornados are at an all time low. These past three years have seen signifigantly less tornadic events than any other year since monitoring in the 1950s. Major hurricanes have been at or bellow average for the past 50 years, whereas the before years before that had substantially more with only one year that was below average.    The above graph shows that droughts have been very stable over the past few years, despite the idea that the Earth should heating up. In fact there has been no signifigant changes with number of droughts or their severity, so any argumnet that droughts are increasing is just false. The opposing argument often points bad weather and says 'Ha! Here! We told you this would happen!.' But the fact is, bad weather happens, and we should not assume the globe is warming just because some bad weather happens here and there.     Climate Models: This argument looks at the climate models that the pro-Anthropogenic Climate Scientists.   A former NASA scientist has examined the climate models and found that of those he examined, 95% of thes overcasted actual warming for years, meaning that they have been wrong time and time agian about what the global temperature SHOULD have been. I will tie this into another point, and that is that almost all predictions made by pro-Anthropogenic Global Warming scientists have been WRONG! By now the ice caps should be MELTED! Polar bears should be drowning! However as shown above this was simply proven to be completely false.   Hockeystick Graph: This argument examines the often sited 'Hockeystick Graph.'   No specific site for this one, I just know about it. So the problem with the graph is that it is a cherrypicked portion of global temperatures on Earth, and if we looked at centuries prior we would see similar, if not higher Temperature Levels without added CO2 by humans. So basically it is more of a scare tactic than actual proof of Anthropogenic Global Warming.     THANK YOU so much for debating me, and I appologize if I did everything wrong, but this is part of the reason I am doing this so if you could just give me some tips and corrections I would be most appreciative. Also, the 'truths' at the top probabaly should have been stated at the beginning, so I appologize for that.</h>

    <t>First off, THANK YOU! I am very excited to have this debate, and I hope it goes well.This debate assumes that climate change has happened over the past centuries, and that over that period of time there has been a overall increase in global temperatures. So yes, I think. Before we start I would like to present these following facts/opinion that I humbly ask my opponent and voters to count as truth in this debate. As of now, current levels of CO2 are around 400 parts per million, give or take a little. Another is that most scientists who believe in Antropogenic Warming think that global temperatures will increase by 2-4 degrees C by the end of the century. Finally, most of said Anthropogenic Global Warming is caused by release of CO2 according to most scientists who believe in this form of warming. Make any changes or additions to this list as you see fit, also while some of these are opinions I ask that in this debate we consider them truths. If you disagree please make it be known in you speech, and provide counter 'truths.' Lets Begin! Arguments that Contradict and Disprove the Idea of Anthropogenic Global Warming 18 Year Equalibrium: In this argument we will examine the fact that there has been no warming for 18 years and 4 months. (actually 6, but site is one month old)  From December 1996-March 2015 there has been no global warming as shown in the average. This really is shocking in the grand scheme of things because this proves that despite the world blasting carbon into the air, there has been no change in average temperature. This completely contradicts what Pro-antropogenic Global Warming scientists believe, meaning that they have prodicted it all incorrectly. 30000 Scientists: In this argument we look at the MASSIVE number of scientists that oppose the idea of Anthropogenic Global Warming. A petition has been cycling has aquired 31,487 scientists who reject the idea of Antropogenic Global Warming, 9,029 of those individuals have a PHD. An argument of the oppisate side is that there is a concensus amongst scientists that Global Warming is caused, but these numbers clearly destroy this notion. When we have this many scientists, especially those with PHDs, who say that global warming is not caused by human activities and any 'evidence' that says otherwise is false, you must assume that something simply is not correct with the opposing arguments. Antarctic/Arctic Ice: In this argument we will examine the fact that Antarctic Ice has hit all time records and the fact that Arctic Ice rebounded by 50% from 2012-2013.   Antarctic Ice hit its all time record in 2014, surpassing the 20 million square millimeter mark. The antarctic ice has been increasing by about 18,900 square kilometers since recording first began. Increase in this ice has been occuring for several years, and in the past few years have been making new records while Arctic Ice on the other hand has been struggling. I frankly will be the first to admit it, however I will LOUDLY proclaim the fact that it has been making comebacks. From 2012 to 2013 Arctic ice rebounded by 50%. This means that despite this 'global warming,' ice continued to increase. So basically during this time period, both the arctic and antarctic ice increased, despit increased CO2 which should have caused an increase in temperature. Even though Arctic Ice had been shrinking, the fact that it increased speaks volumes to what is really happening.   Ice Age: In this argument we will examine an ice age that occured whis CO2 levels were signifigantly higher than they are today. s://stevengoddard.files.wordpress.com...; alt='' width='640' height='404' /gt;  (this graph shows the Atmoshperic Carbon Levels and Average Global Temperatures from around 600 million years ago till today) As this graph clearly depicts that at around the 450 million year mark Earth went into a HUGE ice age. However during this time CO2 Levels were at a little more than 4000 ppm. 4000! This means that Earth was experiencing and ice age while the CO2 levels were more than 10 times what they are today. Now the fact is: if what some scientists are saying is true, and CO2 has the power to raise the temperature of the planet by 2-4 degrees by the end of century, then this simply should not have happend. The is conclusion is this: CO2 does not have an impact on global temperatures because there have been cases in past where huge opposites have occured that simply should not have happened according to opposing scientists.  Flawed Arguments of the Opposing Side  97% Consensus: This argument examines the often sited 97% consesus of scientists that believe global warming is real and is caused by human activities and is dangerous.  This study was run by one person and a couple friends who supposably read over 10,000 papers, and said that 97% endorsed the idea that global warming is human caused, and dangerous. However, a professor and 3 coauthors went back through and looked at these papers and saw that this was simply not the case. In fact, they found that only 0.3% of these papers supported the idea. Therefore we can conclude that the 97% consensus is false. The reason you believe the professor is because he is a professor. The other individual was a blogger, who to the extent of my knowledge did not have these types of credentials and could not have made better conclusions than the proffesor.   Weather:  In this argument we examine how arguments about weather are completely unjustified.  Tornados are at an all time low. These past three years have seen signifigantly less tornadic events than any other year since monitoring in the 1950s. Major hurricanes have been at or bellow average for the past 50 years, whereas the before years before that had substantially more with only one year that was below average.    The above graph shows that droughts have been very stable over the past few years, despite the idea that the Earth should heating up. In fact there has been no signifigant changes with number of droughts or their severity, so any argumnet that droughts are increasing is just false. The opposing argument often points bad weather and says 'Ha! Here! We told you this would happen!.' But the fact is, bad weather happens, and we should not assume the globe is warming just because some bad weather happens here and there.     Climate Models: This argument looks at the climate models that the pro-Anthropogenic Climate Scientists.   A former NASA scientist has examined the climate models and found that of those he examined, 95% of thes overcasted actual warming for years, meaning that they have been wrong time and time agian about what the global temperature SHOULD have been. I will tie this into another point, and that is that almost all predictions made by pro-Anthropogenic Global Warming scientists have been WRONG! By now the ice caps should be MELTED!

    <t>I thank Kylar for accepting this debate.   C1) Climate Sensitivity amp; Feedbacks  My first contention is to demonstrate CO2 has effects in rising the mean land-sea temperature. Climate sensitivity is the level of hypothetical temperature rise if the concentration of atmospheric CO2 would double. [1] It is not a much debated fact that the temperature rise would be by 1 degrees C. This, though, can be amplified by feedbacks. Positive feedbacks amplify the temperature rise, and negative feedbacks diminish the temperature rise.   A study published in Climate Research proved that the mean climate sensitivity is approximately 1 to 1.6 degrees Celsius due to the level of positive feedbacks. [2] Another significant body of research notes that climate sensitivity is likely much higher. A review of the evidence in 2008 finds that mean climate sensitivity is 3 degrees C, with a range of 2 – 4.5 degrees C. Nearly every study taken discovers the average climate sensitivity is 3 degrees C. [3]    The above graph demonstrates the effect of upper fluctuations in equilibrium temperature via. feedbacks. [4]    The graph shown above was from a 2007 research that places approximate mean climate sensitivity to double CO2 concentration at around 2.5 - 3. [5]   It is a well known fact that industrial emissions have major impact on the concentration levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. “In pre-industrial times over the last 10,000 years, CO2 was relatively stable at around 275 to 285 parts per million. Over the last 250 years, atmospheric CO2 levels have increased by about 100 parts per million.” [6]   Thus, human-caused amplified climate sensitivity affects mean land-sea temperature.   C2) Human-Emitted Greenhouse Gases  There is a documented rise in CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere over the last 250 years, with a 100 ppm increase in industrial times *alone*, versus a 50 ppm increase from 9,750 years prior. Below is a graph showing the rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. [7-8]    It is a well-known fact that majority of increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations is caused by humans. This is because of the sudden hike during industrial times alone. [6] CO2 is known to form an atmospheric layer and trap heat within the atmosphere, thus increasing the mean temperature via. the greenhouse effect, wherein insolation and terrestrial radiation are both trapped within the atmosphere. [9-10]   Below is a graph showing a correlation in the rise in temperature and rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations.     “[T]here is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr.” [11]   The CO2-temperature correlation is also influenced by CO2’s impact on solar radiation itself. In the Cenozoic era, there was a rise in solar activity due to CO2. “Because Earth absorbs about 240 W/m^2 of solar energy, that brightness increase is a forcing of about 1 W/m^2. This small linear increase of forcing, by itself, would have caused a modest global warming through the Cenozoic Era.' The CO2 levels caused a much higher forcing. In contrast, atmospheric CO2 during the Cenozoic changed from at least 1000 ppm in the early Cenozoic to as small as 170 ppm during recent ice ages. The resulting climate forcing, as can be computed accurately for this CO2 range using formulae in Table 1 of Hansen et al. (2000), exceeds 10 W/m^2. It is clear that CO2 was the dominant climate forcing in the Cenozoic.” [12]   There is proof that it is warmer now than any year of human life since 1400. This is depicted in the graph below. [13]      Conclusion  Thus, I have presented two valid contentions as to why global warming is man-made. Con must present contentions of their own in the next round and defend theirs in the round after. The resolution is resoundingly affirmed. </t>

    <t>I gladly accept this debate with my friend and I look forward to a great debate :).</t>
<h>I thank my friend for this debate and I am sorry for the mix-up. Now to post arguments:  How did global warming discussions end up hinging on what's happening with polar bears, unverifiable predictions of what will happen in a hundred years, and whether people are 'climate deniers' or 'global warming cultists?' If this is a scientific topic, why aren't we spending more time discussing the science involved? Why aren't we talking about the evidence and the actual data involved? Why aren't we looking at the predictions that were made and seeing if they match up to the results? If this is such an open and shut case, why are so many people who care about science skeptical? Many Americans have long since thought that the best scientific evidence available suggested that man wasn't causing any sort of global warming. However, now, we can go even further and suggest that the planet isn't warming at all.  1) There hasn't been any global warming since 1997: If nothing changes in the next year, we're going to have kids who graduate from high school who will have never seen any 'global warming' during their lifetimes. That's right; the temperature of the planet has essentially been flat for 17 years. This isn't a controversial assertion either. Even the former Director of the Climate Research Unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia, Phil Jones, admits that it's true. Since the planet was cooling from 1940-1975 and the upswing in temperature afterward only lasted 22 years, a 17 year pause is a big deal. It also begs an obvious question: How can we be experiencing global warming if there's no actual 'global warming?'  2) There is no scientific consensus that global warming is occurring and caused by man: Questions are not decided by 'consensus.' In fact, many scientific theories that were once widely believed to be true were made irrelevant by new evidence. Just to name one of many, many examples, in the early seventies, scientists believed global cooling was occurring. However, once the planet started to warm up, they changed their minds. Yet, the primary 'scientific' argument for global warming is that there is a 'scientific consensus' that it's occurring. Setting aside the fact that's not a scientific argument, even if that ever was true (and it really wasn't), it's certainly not true anymore. Over 31,000 scientists have signed on to a petition saying humans aren't causing global warming. More than 1000 scientists signed on to another report saying there is no global warming at all. There are tens of thousands of well-educated, mainstream scientists who do not agree that global warming is occurring at all and people who share their opinion are taking a position grounded in science.  3) Arctic ice is up 50% since 2012: The loss of Arctic ice has been a big talking point for people who believe global warming is occurring. Some people have even predicted that all of the Arctic ice would melt by now because of global warming. Yet, Arctic ice is up 50% since 2012. How much Arctic ice really matters is an open question since the very limited evidence we have suggests that a few decades ago, there was less ice than there is today, but the same people who thought the drop in ice was noteworthy should at least agree that the increase is important as well.  4) Climate models showing global warming have been wrong over and over: These future projections of what global warming will do to the planet have been based on climate models. Essentially, scientists make assumptions about how much of an impact different factors will have; they guess how much of a change there will be and then they project changes over time. Unfortunately, almost all of these models showing huge temperature gains have turned out to be wrong.  Former NASA scientist Dr. Roy Spencer says that climate models used by government agencies to create policies 'have failed miserably.' Spencer analyzed 90 climate models against surface temperature and satellite temperature data, and found that more than 95 percent of the models 'have over-forecast the warming trend since 1979, whether we use their own surface temperature dataset (HadCRUT4), or our satellite dataset of lower tropospheric temperatures (UAH).' There's an old saying in programming that goes, 'Garbage in, garbage out.' In other words, if the assumptions and data you put into the models are faulty, then the results will be worthless. If the climate models that show a dire impact because of global warming aren't reliable -- and they're not -- then the long term projections they make are meaningless.  5) Predictions about the impact of global warming have already been proven wrong: The debate over global warming has been going on long enough that we've had time to see whether some of the predictions people made about it have panned out in the real world. For example, Al Gore predicted all the Arctic ice would be gone by 2013. In 2005, the Independent ran an article saying that the Artic had entered a death spiral.  Scientists fear that the Arctic has now entered an irreversible phase of warming which will accelerate the loss of the polar sea ice that has helped to keep the climate stable for thousands of years....The greatest fear is that the Arctic has reached a 'tipping point' beyond which nothing can reverse the continual loss of sea ice and with it the massive land glaciers of Greenland, which will raise sea levels dramatically. Of course, the highway is still there. Meanwhile, Arctic ice is up 50% since 2012. James Hansen of NASA fame predicted that the West Side Highway in New York would be under water by now because of global warming.  If the climate models and the predictions about global warming aren't even close to being correct, wouldn't it be more scientific to reject hasty action based on faulty data so that we can further study the issue and find out what's really going on?

    <t>Observations  Ob1: Under “Full Resolution”, it clearly says the existence of GW is assumed, and Con must show that it is not man-made. This is violated by Con, but I shall rebut it nonetheless.   Ob2: Once more, Con’s entire case is C/P’d from his source (albeit the source is presented this time), thus there are no original arguments presented by Con.   Ob3: Con violates the debate structure by dropping ALL my arguments. I extend all my arguments to this round.   Rebuttals  R1) Global Warming Exists  According to NASA’s GISS surface temperature analysis, the global mean land-sea temperature rose from 1980 to 2014 by 0.8 degrees Celsius, and the corresponding graph shows a constant increase in temperature throughout the years from 1980 to 2014 [1].     The alleged 17-year pause is incorrect, as there has been a 0.8 degrees C increase in temperature. The global land-sea average temperature in December 2014 was the highest monthly land-sea average in 135 years [2]. There have been major temperature anomalies throughout December 2014 itself [3].    R2) Scientific Consensus  A study published in Science reviewed the ISI web of science in order to take a survey of relevant climate literature as to what the causes of climate change are. The study failed to find a single paper which was in opposition to the consensus position, that the main driver of climate change is anthropogenic. 75% of the papers supported the consensus position, whereas 25% had no position (they were focused on things other than forgings, like impacts or paleoclimate) [4]. “[T]he National Academy of Sciences report, Climate Change Science: An Analysis of Some Key Questions, begins: “Greenhouse gases are accumulating in Earth's atmosphere as a result of human activities, causing surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise.” [4-5] A 196 page report representing 13 governmental agencies, and written by 28 authors from scientific institutions, has stated “[t]he global warming of the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced increases in heat-trapping gases …” [6] According to NASA, “[n]inety-seven percent of climate scientists agree that climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities.” [7]     Above is a graph presented by 4 major institutes that have taken a study on the temperature anomaly, and the results from NASA, MOHC/CRU, NOAA Climatic Data Center, and the Japanese Meteorological Agency have almost identical results [7].   R3) Arctic Ice  Con concedes that this is irrelevant to the issue, and this is merely a prediction made by some supporters of global warming, thus I need not address this. Nonetheless, I wish to point out that “[t]he European Space Agency’s CryoSat mission has returned its latest map of Arctic sea ice volumes, recording a slight decrease in thickness over previous measurements.” [8]   R4) Climate Models  While climate models may have been wrong, they were only predictions of the increase. A certain level of increase happened nonetheless, and that is relevant to the resolution, while this is completely irrelevant to the resolution.   R5) Predictions  This is a repeat of “Climate Models” and “Arctic Ice”. The current data is not faulty unless proven otherwise, thus this argument is useless and irrelevant.   I sincerely request Con to frame his own argument for the next round instead of C/Ping it.   Arguments  ALL my arguments are dropped. I extend all my arguments.</t>

In addition, my opponent’s ‘case’ is plagiarized [1].   Furthermore, the only relevant argument presented by my opponent is “fossil fuels cause [global warming].” But these fossil fuels result in man-made emissions of CO2 that results in GW, thus this case is contrary to my opponent’s position and supports my position.

    <t>I accept your debate, pro! Now, there is a good deal of evidence that humans are not causing global warming at all. It was simply America heeding Al Gore's warnings based on misguided interpretations of scientific studies. Our planet has a natural cycle of heating up and cooling back down. In fact, from 1940 to 1975, 'global cooling' was the big issue, but that scientific theory was discovered to be false. You can read about global cooling here.  This isn't just an ignorant, uneducated viewpoint; thousands of scientists have signed a petition claiming that humans aren't causing global warming. A lot of environmentalists claim that because there is a scientific consensus and all sorts of graphs and charts, global warming is definitely real. That isn't how questions are answered. A lot of scientific theories were widely accepted by the public in the past were suddenly made irrelevant with new evidence.  It's widely believed that global warming is causing Arctic ice to melt. Mysteriously, the Arctic ice cap has expanded by 50% since 2012. Also, the climate models created by skilled scientists, who can't even accurately predict when it will rain half of the time, have been wrong over and over. As many as 95% of them have proven inaccurate. There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere.  But let's just say that if global warming theorists were right, which they are not in many cases, what would happen if the Earth became filled up with the greenhouse effect? It has happened before in the Earth's history, in the Ordovician period 440 million years ago. The carbon dioxide concentration was up by a whopping 16 times that of today. The planet still supported plenty of flora and fauna, so the environment certainly wasn't in danger. These carbon dioxide emissions were caused by mass volcanic activity, and they were eventually brought down by the same thing, volcanic activity. Global warming is not being caused by humans, and there is no clear or present danger because of it.</t>

    <t>Very well, here are my closing thoughts. I do believe that global warming exists, and I must correct you: my argument was not that global warming will have no repercussions on the environment at all. My argument was that it won't be as severe as the 'doomsday' scientists predict will come very soon. Though arguments from your side of the spectrum are very much based in fact and science, it should be at least acknowledged that in the end, humans are prone to error, including scientists, and they cannot predict the future. This is a simple truth that I can't really cite sources for. It's a shrewd quality to be cautious for the worst possible outcome, but it shouldn't gain so much attention in politics. The United States government, however, spends around $20 billion for both global warming and nuclear weapons, relatively equal. While trying to protect the planet in all of its natural beauty in a noble cause, it's simply not realistic to spend billions of dollars on it. Instead, the government should be focusing on education, military, and law enforcement: issues that are relevant and short-term. To conclude, global warming exists, but is not grave or tangible enough to be treated as a serious issue in the politics of today's world.  Good luck, Pro. Thank you for a good debate.</t>

    <t>Panicking of environmentalists about climate change is based on future projections and speculation, nearly all of which have turned out to be wrong. Humans may be contributing to shifts in the Earth's temperature. Al Gore claimed that by 2012, Antarctica would be completely melted due to global warming. What melting-ice-caps activists fail to realize is that most of Antarctica's ice is already underwater. When you put a piece of ice in a glass of water, it raises slightly, does it not? And when that ice melts, does the water level raise? No, because it has already been displaced by the ice. The ocean works by those rules, and there is no danger of a global flood.  Another fault in environmentalist logic is their emphasis on how humans are the only reason global warming could possibly happen. Humans do have an affect on the environment, of course. But their impact is relatively small, because natural cycles and extinction events will happen whether or not fossil fuels are being burned. Even if humanity makes no attempt to switch to a different energy source, temperature will only rise a few degrees Celsius. Effects of this would be minor, certainly not helping to spread diseases, droughts, or smog. Even less likely is a mass extinction event.</t>

    <t>This organization, that 1 kilogram of meat is responsible for the amount of carbon in the atmosphere as a car driving 250 kilometers.'  I hate to break it to you, but the reason why cows aren't usually mentioned in global warming studies is because the cow problem...  Has already been solved!  Fish oils reduce by 20% (1) Gas capturing by 25% (2) Fart-reducing supplement by 60% (3)  And farmers who own these cows aren't reluctant in doing this!  However, the CO2 problem has solutions that have been pushed away with reluctance. That's why it's discussed so often.  'Also the same webiste, skeptical science, states that natural causes like oceans and vegitation are 750 giggatons while out output is 29giggatons'  Oh, you mean this one? (4)  *facepalm*  If you were to just READ WHAT IT SAID, you would see that it REFUTES your point. While natural causes emit a lot of CO2, they also capture CO2. We are offsetting the balance, however, which puts CO2 into the atmosphere.  'albedo clouds are changing and that there are emmiting more than 2x the greenhouse gases humans are emmiting'  Wait, they are emitting greenhouse gases? First, that is completely wrong. Clouds don't emit greenhouse gases. Second, Albedo is steady as shown in the website.  'You wanted citation for the gravitational magnetic oscillations, here it is: A book from Cornelius van Huten'  Milankovitch cycles don't explain the rapid warming we see today. Take a look at this. (5)  See how the warming line is kind of steady? However, look where it says 2004. See how it is SIGNIFICANTLY upwards from where the black line ends? That's how quickly the temperature is rising.  'You claim that the sun is on a cooling trend' 'this link says other wise, they claim that the Earth has natural cycles of warming and cooling and that is backed up by the natural cycles of the magnetic field and the sun.'

    <t>You said yourself, 'that the co2 being placed in the atmosphere is causing natural changes'. Who is placing that CO2 in the atmosphere? Us! See the bottom.  'the increasing birth rate of cows, who can produce enought carbon dioxide and methane to fill up a jar the size of Rhode island'  1. The link is faulty. 2. A jar the size of Rhode Island would be 2-D 3. If you had a jar with the base being Rhode Island, and it was filled with all of the CO2 emitted by humans in 2010, the height of the jar would be:  ( (The amount of CO2 emitted by humans in 2010 in tons) * (Number of kilograms in a ton) / (Density of CO2 in kg/m^3) ) / ( (Area of Rhode Island in square miles) * (Number of square meters in a square mile) ) = Height of jar in meters  ( 33615389000 * 907.185 / 1.98 ) / ( 1212 * 2589988 ) = Approximately 4906.462 meters  So the jar would be about as high as 6 Burj Khalifas stacked on top of each other. That's for humans.  'chnages in the formation of albedo clouds can create a negative feedbacks that cancel out all or nearly all of warming effect of higher level of co2.'  Well, well, well. Look what we have here: (1)  You see, earth's albedo has been very steady, but the earth is warming. The albedo, while playing an important factor, isn't doing much nowadays.  'that the greatest influence on climate is the transformation of Earths surface'  See the bottom.  'how the natural process of algea is being adapted to the new formation of currents and is a prime factor in the realese of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere'  Algae consumes CO2. Look at number 3 in this list: (2)  'natural gravitational and magnetic oscillations of the solar system induced by the planets movement through space can dribe climate change and naturaly effect the Earths magnetic field'  Ridiculous claim needs citation. NOW!  Next one says that the sun can cause climate change.  Well, the sun has been on a cooling trend since the 60's, but the Earth has been warming. (3)  NOTE REBUTTAL!  'At first, people where afraid that the earth was going to be placed in another iceage because of Co2 not in a rising temperature.'  Actually, most people thought the earth was going to warm, not go into another ice age. The thing is, Man-Made Global Warming says that the earth is warming, and people are making the earth warm due to CO2 emissions. If you think that the CO2 emissions are causing something else that causes warming, that still means you believe in Man-Made Global Warming.</t>

<h>A significant tip of the hat to Con for their respect and generosity. Nice to know that religious debates still have the capacity to end on a professional note. Let's do it again sometime (preferably when I'm not under a thousand deadlines)! As all the following points are directed specifically at Christianity, I will approach my rebuttals from that perspective as far as my character limit will allow (which is less than I would like, sadly). First of all, religion is not as simple as we'd all like it to be, and as such, it needs to be handled carefully. It's safe to say that people who have spent their entire lives studying the biblical texts, thousands of years of exegesis, theology, and hermeneutics, and careful examination of the bible's original culture, heritage, treatment, languages, and context are going to know a lot more about how Christianity should be practiced than the average soccer mom or politician. Just like an actual medical scientist with a degree and ten years of university education is going to know a lot more about vaccines than a talk show host. It's the church's job to communicate its truths just like it's the medical community's job to communicate its truths (although there will invariably be dissent in both camps on certain issues, and one cannot guarantee that the masses will listen). If the church has failed in this commission, that's hardly the fault of Christianity itself, which actually condemns failure to properly instruct. Credit where credit is due. Con asks the question of what makes someone an extremist. My definition of an extremist is someone who takes an idea farther than it was meant to go, and subsequently causes harm. This can apply to religion, politics, civil rights... any opinion one has passion for, which is why we must be careful not to appeal to our emotions before we have considered our reasoning.  “from my personal experience, religion never does what it claims (makes people kinder or more moral).”  From my personal experience, religion never fails to do so. To each their own?  “The idea that the Old Testament is somehow 'null and void' because of the 'new covenant' is not biblically supportable (in fact, Jesus is quoted as saying that he comes not to change the [Mosaic] law) and will offend a significant number of Christians; are they extremists?” There are a few problems with Con's statement. Firstly, I never actually said that the Old Testament is null and void in Christianity. I said that the old covenant is. They are not the same thing. Secondly, what Jesus says in Matthew 5 is “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.” The word “change” does not appear in any translation I've been able to find, so saying Jesus is “quoted” as saying it is a bit of an exaggeration. Christ's sacrifice fulfilled the law and established a new covenant with all people. This covenant was built on the foundations of the old one, which is why many of the moral precepts in the Old Testament (the ten commandments, for instance) are still applicable, but the laws concerning what is clean and unclean, or laws discussing the judicial punishments for sin in the nation of Israel, etc., are not. My original point still stands. Any Christians who believe that the entire Mosaic law still applies to them have hugely misunderstood their theology (and seeing how few of them are willing to actually follow the 900+ laws contained therein, I'd say we have a hypocrisy problem as well). 'I know this: families are literally torn apart because a son is gay; that sentence needs correction: families are literally torn apart because they are religious; homosexuality is not a choice, religion is.' I am unaware of a single passage of Scripture that endorses the appalling treatment of homosexuals that the church has engaged in. I am, however, aware of thousands that condemn it. “I've met people on this site who literally stand for bringing back stoning-to-death because the bible prescribes it... are they extremists? Does their existence or, more properly, do their beliefs not demonstrate the responsibility that religion has for making the World a worse place?” I've seen atheists who believe that the only problem with Communism is that it didn't kill enough believers. I've seen atheists use Charles Darwin to promote and excuse eugenics, murder, rape, and racism. I've seen atheists who claim that anyone who subscribes to religious belief should be thrown into psychological institutions and tortured until they're “cured.” Is the world improved by their existence or beliefs? In my previous argument, I addressed that the bloodiest democidal regimes of the 20th century were almost exclusively spearheaded by atheists, despite the fact that, from a global perspective, atheists are an incredibly small demographic. Is that not reason to be concerned? Furthermore, if a Christian promotes slavery because of Deuteronomy, I can show him Galatians 3:28, which proclaims that there is no slave and free, Jew and Gentile, male and female, because we are all equal under Christ. However, if an atheist promotes slavery because of naturalism and survival of the fittest (after all, Slave-Making Ants do precisely what their name implies, why shouldn't we?), I have nothing to offer him but pseudo-philosophy and an ethics lecture which he would be well within his rights to dismiss as insufficient evidence. Is that enough reason to condemn non-belief as dangerous? “James Inhofe is potentially the most powerful man on Earth in terms of setting policy regarding man-made climate change, limiting carbon emissions, limiting agricultral chemical run-off, pollution, etc... and he says that there's no such thing as man-made climate change and he seems to think that Bronze Age texts (specifically the book of Genesis) prove that fact. What's worse is that he uses Romans 1:25 to peddle the idea that any climate campaigners are essentially working for the devil by worshipping false gods (worshipping the creation not the creator).” Strange, that, seeing as the very book of Genesis names Man as the steward of Earth, and discusses his responsibility in its subsequent corruption after the Fall. The bible also discusses how creation declares the glory of God. What reason could we possibly have to want for its destruction? Someone who cannot be bothered to read anything more than what they personally find useful is a hypocrite, and someone who thinks that the bible has anything significant to say on a topic as isolated to modern science as climate change (or GMOs, for that matter) is someone I won't hesitate to accuse of using religion as a cover for their personal biases. However, once again, we cannot necessarily blame religion for its idiots. “The Catholic church [peddles] the idea that condoms are universally wicked; the result of this is absolutely, specifically and directly that innocent men women and children suffer horribly and die because of the unnecessary spread of AIDS in Africa [2]. I blame religion for this effect; are you with me?” This is actually nowhere near as cut-and-dried as people think it is. Abstinence, fewer sexual partners, and monogamy are doing more to halt the AIDS crisis than condoms [1] [2]. Strangely, all three of those sound suspiciously like Christian teachings. 'in reality, murder rates are not obviously negatively correlated (quite the opposite) with religiosity.' Con has not addressed my rebuttals on this point. Finally, I actually would stand to disagree with Con that group selection accounts for morality and renders religion unnecessary in that regard. Group selection is a logical concept, but not a realistic one. After all, while a tribe that shares its food equally among its members will be stronger than a tribe that does not, tribal members that exploit the altruism of their fellows and hoard whatever food they can grab will be much stronger and better off than those they are exploiting, and will therefore be better candidates for natural selection. Even positing social consequence (i.e., they choose not to steal food for fear of a punishment from the tribe) falls flat because it requires there to already be a moral understanding in place (i.e., stealing food is wrong, and deserves to be punished). Morality of the kind that humans currently possess is not realistic through an evolutionary lens, because the “selfish gene” cannot (and has no reason to) act in the best interests of the group, only the individual. Even kin selection only explains altruism within one's genetic group. As far as this debate goes, here's what I acknowledge:    1. beliefs, more often than not, lead to actions.    2. if those beliefs are harmful, the actions will be harmful.    3. if religions preach things that are harmful, and people believe and act on them, it's safe to say that religion does not improve the state of the world.    But I also believe this:   1. religion teaches many things that are good, just, merciful, kind, and selfless.   2. religion is not to blame for people who misuse it or misunderstand it.   3. atheism/secularism has just as much capacity to cause evil as religion.   In conclusion, this debate has not seen me at my best. I feel it is only right to admit defeat, as I agree entirely that I have not provided sufficient evidence that religion, as a whole, makes the world a better place. I do believe that Christianity, at least, is a force for good, and I believe I can (and have) made that point to one degree or another, but as far as the topic at hand, I acknowledge my lack of a strong case. I thank Con for an insightful discussion, and hope the voters will bestow their points on the deserving winner.</h>

    <t>A significant tip of the hat to Con for their respect and generosity. Nice to know that religious debates still have the capacity to end on a professional note. Let's do it again sometime (preferably when I'm not under a thousand deadlines)! As all the following points are directed specifically at Christianity, I will approach my rebuttals from that perspective as far as my character limit will allow (which is less than I would like, sadly). First of all, religion is not as simple as we'd all like it to be, and as such, it needs to be handled carefully. It's safe to say that people who have spent their entire lives studying the biblical texts, thousands of years of exegesis, theology, and hermeneutics, and careful examination of the bible's original culture, heritage, treatment, languages, and context are going to know a lot more about how Christianity should be practiced than the average soccer mom or politician. Just like an actual medical scientist with a degree and ten years of university education is going to know a lot more about vaccines than a talk show host. It's the church's job to communicate its truths just like it's the medical community's job to communicate its truths (although there will invariably be dissent in both camps on certain issues, and one cannot guarantee that the masses will listen). If the church has failed in this commission, that's hardly the fault of Christianity itself, which actually condemns failure to properly instruct. Credit where credit is due. Con asks the question of what makes someone an extremist. My definition of an extremist is someone who takes an idea farther than it was meant to go, and subsequently causes harm. This can apply to religion, politics, civil rights... any opinion one has passion for, which is why we must be careful not to appeal to our emotions before we have considered our reasoning.  “from my personal experience, religion never does what it claims (makes people kinder or more moral).”  From my personal experience, religion never fails to do so. To each their own?  “The idea that the Old Testament is somehow 'null and void' because of the 'new covenant' is not biblically supportable (in fact, Jesus is quoted as saying that he comes not to change the [Mosaic] law) and will offend a significant number of Christians; are they extremists?” There are a few problems with Con's statement. Firstly, I never actually said that the Old Testament is null and void in Christianity. I said that the old covenant is. They are not the same thing. Secondly, what Jesus says in Matthew 5 is “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.” The word “change” does not appear in any translation I've been able to find, so saying Jesus is “quoted” as saying it is a bit of an exaggeration. Christ's sacrifice fulfilled the law and established a new covenant with all people. This covenant was built on the foundations of the old one, which is why many of the moral precepts in the Old Testament (the ten commandments, for instance) are still applicable, but the laws concerning what is clean and unclean, or laws discussing the judicial punishments for sin in the nation of Israel, etc., are not. My original point still stands. Any Christians who believe that the entire Mosaic law still applies to them have hugely misunderstood their theology (and seeing how few of them are willing to actually follow the 900+ laws contained therein, I'd say we have a hypocrisy problem as well). 'I know this: families are literally torn apart because a son is gay; that sentence needs correction: families are literally torn apart because they are religious; homosexuality is not a choice, religion is.' I am unaware of a single passage of Scripture that endorses the appalling treatment of homosexuals that the church has engaged in. I am, however, aware of thousands that condemn it. “I've met people on this site who literally stand for bringing back stoning-to-death because the bible prescribes it... are they extremists? Does their existence or, more properly, do their beliefs not demonstrate the responsibility that religion has for making the World a worse place?” I've seen atheists who believe that the only problem with Communism is that it didn't kill enough believers. I've seen atheists use Charles Darwin to promote and excuse eugenics, murder, rape, and racism. I've seen atheists who claim that anyone who subscribes to religious belief should be thrown into psychological institutions and tortured until they're “cured.” Is the world improved by their existence or beliefs? In my previous argument, I addressed that the bloodiest democidal regimes of the 20th century were almost exclusively spearheaded by atheists, despite the fact that, from a global perspective, atheists are an incredibly small demographic. Is that not reason to be concerned? Furthermore, if a Christian promotes slavery because of Deuteronomy, I can show him Galatians 3:28, which proclaims that there is no slave and free, Jew and Gentile, male and female, because we are all equal under Christ.

    <t>First of all, I'd like to thank Pro for accepting the debate and tip my hat to a clinical first round.I do concede one aspect of religion that is almost unambiguously positive: it provides individuals with a support group.  This seemingly simple provision has lots of knock-on effects, and I would argue that one mechanism underpinning many of Pro's first statistics (insofar as they are accurate) is the sense of community that a church engenders; we are, after all is said and done, highly social animals.I consider this a challenge to secular communities around the World: we must find a way to reproduce that one powerful and important successful aspect of religion... the stability of a support network of mutual trust and love.  I see no reason why this effect cannot be achieved in a secular setting, thus robbing religion of a monopoly that it currently exploits.Right now, secular communities are in the large part failing this challenge; this situation provides the basis to make the claim that religion is making the World better... in one sense, it is... it is via our religions that we have (as a species) discovered the most successful bonding mechanisms for large groups.  There are dangers as well as benefits, though; the power that religion weilds is both a cohesive and a divisive force.  I will return to this idea in a later round.Pro begins on the edge of a very real (but small) effect: atheism correlates with higher suicide rates.  On the face of it, this is a no-brainer win for Pro.  I beseech the gentle reader consider why the correlation happens, though.  It is a discussion that has been thrashed out over the years; one key player in the understanding of the effect is the philosopher David Émile Durkheim, who has been widely acknowledged as one of the fathers of modern Sociology.  Whilst I do not think that everything he says is right, I would encourage any gentle reader interested in the subject from a scholarly perspective to begin with Durkheim.Unfortunately, the study that Pro cited is not particularly useful in studying the effect.  Problems include:1.  The study is looking at suicide attempts, not completed suicides.  It should not need stating but we have much more accurate statistics about actual suicides than about attempts.2.  The study has n=371; this is *far* too small a group to draw conclusions from.3.  It is unclear how effectively the study selected the 371 participants in an impartial way.But didn't I already concede the point that atheism correlates with higher suicide rates?  Yes, yes, I did... but the very article to which Pro directs our attention [1] warns away from a simplistic interpretation of this fact by saying 'compassionate tolerance for suicide and euthenasia are widely regarded as hallmarks of many secular societies'.  It may also be noted that more men commit suicide than women, that suicide rates are higher in rural communities AND that suicide rates are higher in industrialized countries.The point that I'm making here is that suicide (or euthanasia) might not be universally bad.  I, for one, present my thinking on this point in this way:1.  There exists such a reality as can be described by the words 'a fate worse than death'2.  I can see no moral justification for pressuring any sentient being who self-identifies 'a fate worse than death' to endure it. - (unless they have dependents, when the story may be more complex)The idea that suicide is universally unacceptable seems to me an artefact of religion (so strong was this pressure that attempting suicide was a criminal offence in my native England until 1961).  What moral reason does the atheist have for objecting to suicide? We don't have to like it, but atheists are generally more accepting of the idea in principle.  Of course we would encourage counselling or medical routes before agreeing that this last resort is a good answer to a given situation.In short, I see no reason why we should accept that a very small decrease in suicides in some American religious communities equates to the World being a better place.  In extreme cases, it may even mean that because of religious pressure (it's a sin to kill yourself), some individuals manfully endure a fate worse than death.  This seems to me to be a bad thing.  I hope that I have given the pensive reader pause for thought.So far I've dedicated half of my space this round to Pro's first claim.  This seems excessive, perhaps, but I wanted to explore Pro's primary claim first.  In case Pro didn't intend for the claims to be in priority order, I invite Pro to pick one or more 'favourite' claims in order to reduce the sheer volume of discourse that would be necessary to tackle some of the issues.More briefly, then, I'll examine the rest of the claims that Pro makes; if Pro wishes to focus their claims then I will dedicate more effort (as I have with suicide).Pro's second claim was based on a paper called “Relationships among Spirituality, Religious Practices, Personality Factors, and Health for Five Different Faiths”, which I took the time to look up.  This paper [2] refers to a study done on 160 people.  I hope that our audience will not be swayed by such small studies, from which we can draw no more than loose conclusions about how such effects may be evident in broader populations.I suggest reference to the rough-guide table of requisite sample sizes provided by the Open University in my reference [3].  According to this table, a study of 371 people may be suitable to describe a population of about 10,000 people.  A study of 160 people may be suitable to describe a population of up to 500 people.  You would need more than 384 people in a study to justify describing a population of 1,000,000 and more again to describe the population of the UK, the US, Europe, Africa or, as the resolution requires, the World.  It is not good science to take a study of 160 people and generalise about the World. Sorry, Pro, but this just won't do.  I'm also going to include a link [4] which may not be considered as authoritative as the OU, but explains the issues around sample size in a more accessible way.Pro's third link discusses a study of 179 people; sorry to get boring, but this won't do.Pro's fourth link at least looks more promissing, certainly in numbers.  In a study of 3,968 older adults in the Piedmont region of North Carolina... I'm going to stop here because I haven't limitless room to debate.  I will come back to this and the other links Pro offers in a later round if necessary.  For now, I'd like the gentle reader to note that all of Pro's statistics relate to America and that the proposition before us relates to the World.Phil Zuckerman has completed a World-wide meta-study to answer some of the questions [5].  He is very clear about his methodology and sample sizes.  I'm going to list some of his findings (all available from [5]).0.2 percent of prisoners in the USA are atheists(10% - 30% of the American population are atheist, depending on specific definition)If religion, prayer, or God-belief hindered criminal behavior, and secularity or atheism fostered lawlessness, we would expect to find the most religious nations having the lowest murder rates and the least religious nations having the highest. But we find just the opposite. Murder rates are actually lower in more secular nations and higher in more religious nations where belief in God is deep and widespread (Jensen 2006; Paul 2005; Fajnzylber et al. 2002; Fox and Levin 2000). And within America, the states with the highest murder rates tend to be highly religious, such as Louisiana and Alabama, but the states with the lowest murder rates tend to be among the least religious in the country, such as Vermont and Oregon (Ellison et al. 2003; Death Penalty Information Center, 2008). Furthermore, although there are some notable exceptions, rates of most violent crimes tend to be lower in the less religious states and higher in the most religious states (United States Census Bureau, 2006). Finally, of the top 50 safest cities in the world, nearly all are in relatively non-religious countries, and of the eight cities within the United States that make the safest-city list, nearly all are located in the least religious regions of the country (Mercer Survey, 2008).So I'm going to wrap this up for now with a map of religiosity around the World [6].And I'm going to note that if I have to concede a small dip in suicides (which may be a good thing), Pro will have to concede a far higher increase in murder rates... even if the effects were matched 1-1, is the World a better place if one less person commits suicide but one more person gets murdered?  I'll leave that for the gentle voter to decide!  I know this: I'd rather commit suicide than be murdered.Kudos to Pro for keeping this on a dry statistical level so far, but your statistics could do with a bit more weight and a lot more geographical diversity!</t>

    <t>I'll start by thanking Pro for an intelligent and thought-provoking debate.  I'm a little sad that it'll all be over in the blink of another eye and would enjoy another debate with Pro on a related (or non-related) subject.  Kudos; keep it real!I've got to squeeze a lot into this last round, so apologies for brevity in some areas that could easily suffer greater scrutiny.  I've also left myself less than an hour to post this last round; and I'm tired and a little groggy from the Bank Holiday in the UK that finished yesterday (it's 6:30 AM here), so, again, apologies if this round lacks the focus and impartiality that it properly deserves.Whilst Pro nobly concedes that it's almost impossible to argue against a belief being bad, as opposed to an action, I must admit that by my own professed standards of evidence, it's not really fair for me to try to win too much ground on the basis of beliefs without evidence of how those beliefs translate to measurable actions; however, I do beg the gentle reader consider some beliefs: for a start, I beg the gentle voter consider whether a more sinister reality than merely belief must necessarily follow (even if we cannot easily measure the effect) from a significant group of people believing that gruesome death is an appropriate punishment for non-conformance to a set of metaphysical beliefs.  I precisely share Pro's sentiment when she says of the statistics about this belief 'I must say I find them rather concerning'.Pro says that the Psalms are poems that should be given poetic license; Pro says that Deuteronomy contains prescriptions for other people; Pro suggests that much of the Old Testament represents an old covenant that is null and void. Pro suggests that the Jewish consensus is the rather contradictory position that stoning to death is moral but should not be practiced. Pro suggests that we should not tar religions with the same brush as we might use for extremists.  I ask: 'and what, exactly, is an extremist'?  I feel that Pro, like most Christians I know, is a sensible, rational, kind and intelligent force for good in this World. Most religious people are moderate and sensible and kind and good.  I don't (unlike some of them) attribute their goodness to their religion... in fact, I believe that most people I know are sensible, rational, kind and intelligent and a force for good in this World (and I believe that there's good reason why natural selection through group selection made us that way); religion's effect is hard to measure but from my personal experience, religion never does what it claims (makes people kinder or more moral).The idea that Psalms can be undermined by the attribution of poetic licence (not treated literally) will offend a certain number of Christians; are they extremists?  The idea that Deuteronomy should be seen as applying to others will likewise offend a certain number of Christians; are they extremists? The idea that the Old Testament is somehow 'null and void' because of the 'new covenant' is not biblically supportable (in fact, Jesus is quoted as saying that he comes not to change the [Mosaic] law) and will offend a significant number of Christians; are they extremists?I have met Christians on this site who are quite happy to cite the bible as sufficient justification for the idea that homosexual acts are a sin (whilst using sophistry to distance themselves from the Bible's pro-slavery stance); I've also met Christians on this site who take the view that slavery may well be moral because the Bible seems to be for it... are they extremists?  I know this: families are literally torn apart because a son is gay; that sentence needs correction: families are literally torn apart because they are religious; homosexuality is not a choice, religion is.I'd like to know what Pro thinks about Christians who consider the bible to be inerrant and the literal word of God: are they extremists? If a person believes the story of Adam and Eve literally, believes the story of Noah's Ark, believes that Jonah was swallowed by a big fish, believes that atheists are fools that do no good, believes that it's moral and appropriate to stone children to death for disobedience to their parents... are they extremists?  I've met people on this site who literally stand for bringing back stoning-to-death because the bible prescribes it... are they extremists?  Does their existence or, more properly, do their beliefs not demonstrate the responsibility that religion has for making the World a worse place?I'd like to focus the gentle reader's attention to the fact of James Inhofe.  He is currently, for the second time, Chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Environment.  I have absolutely no idea what he believes (although he often waxes lyrical about it); what worries me, in the context of this debate, is that a man can win political points in America for coming out publically and saying such completely ****ing stupid things as he does [1].  I beg Pro and the gentle reader to really listen to what James Inhofe has to say.James Inhofe is potentially the most powerful man on Earth in terms of setting policy regarding man-made climate change, limiting carbon emissions, limiting agricultral chemical run-off, pollution, etc... and he says that there's no such thing as man-made climate change and he seems to think that Bronze Age texts (specifically the book of Genesis) prove that fact.  What's worse is that he uses Romans 1:25 to peddle the idea that any climate campaigners are essentially working for the devil by worshipping false gods (worshipping the creation not the creator).The Catholic church peddle the idea that condoms are universally wicked; the result of this is absolutely, specifically and directly that innocent men women and children suffer horribly and die because of the unnecessary spread of AIDS in Africa [2].  I blame religion for this effect; are you with me?  I say that it is a far greater offence that the largest organised religion on Earth preaches things that directly cause the suffering and death of my innocent and powerless human brothers and sisters than it would be for a married African man to occassionally rubber-up and sleep with a prostitute on the way home from work (much as I, like the religious, question the morality of this action).Religious belief, I charge, causes one to have certain opinions on issues such as gentically modified crops (how could you believe in a creator of all life and not be profoundly worried by the idea of mankind having the hubris to tinker with that?).  I don't say that GM is universally good... indeed, there are atheistic scientists who urge caution about some aspects of the GM debate; what I do claim, though, is that religion predisposes you to lean a certain way... and, like the Catholic church with sex, condoms and AIDS, this leaning literally causes the suffering and death of significant numbers of innocent men, women and children every year.  In this case, Golden Rice [3][4] could prevent suffering, blindness, illness and death by preventing Vitamin A deficiency.  And we are talking about the lives of tens of millions of human beings every year.It is a natural inclination to believe that a human being who thinks that there is a big sky-daddy watching their every move will behave more morally; it is all of our gut reactions (even atheists) to think that anybody who fears eternal suffering will limit their own bad actions... and yet, in reality, murder rates are not obviously negatively correlated (quite the opposite) with religiosity.  Furthermore, there is good evidence to support the idea that religious beliefs cause palpable damage in the World.  I urge the gentle voter to find against the motion; religion, contrary to our instinctive assumptions and religion's own claims about itself, does not the World a better place make!If you don't do it for me, do it for our grandchildren's environment that James Inhofe is happy to see damaged; do it for the millions of innocent men, women and children who die in Africa every year from AIDS or Vitamin A deficiency: vote Con!I have thoroughly enjoyed this debate and have come to have a lot of respect for Pro; however, I charge that Pro has not provided sufficient evidence of any positive effect of religion that could matter as much as the profound negative consequences that I hope I have demonstrated it has.  I beg the reader remember that we are debating a World-wide issue that includes not only your own personal religion but all religions.  And I remind the voter that I do understand that most religious people are decent human beings who make the World a better place; that was not the issue under scrutiny; the idea here is: would those people be as good without religion?  I charge that they would... how about we all (perhaps arrogantly) accept credit for our own decency and stop attributing our worth to our metaphysical beliefs?  Or, if you're not happy accepting credit for your own decency, attribute it to the wonderous marvel of group selection; I know that I do!</t>

    <t>Thank you, Pro, for admitting the weakness in your Round 1 statistics.  They suffer from being small-scale and geographically centralised.When you say: 'I would have liked to cite being in physical journals or books, which I am obviously unable to provide links to (and I hardly expect Con or the voters to rush out and buy them to determine their information's reliability)', you do me an injustice.  I am rational and fair-minded enough to actually want to know if I'm wrong.  Therefore I ask that you at least list the sources which you have which have obviously convinced you of the truth of the proposition.  I may well purchase access to an academic paper or buy a book (I may even prove to you that I have done so).  I don't want to believe wrong things!When you say 'most of the research on the topic of religion's correlation with better health (which is, in itself, a fairly young area of study) comes from the United States' and 'there is so far a paucity of resources as far as the world at large is concerned' then you are implicitly agreeing that the jury is still out on the question, so you can hardly claim it as a point to you in this debate.  Don't believe things without sufficient evidence, please; if you do, please don't expect the rest of us to share your opinions.'I can endeavour to find studies with more representative subject pools should Con request it' - please do so.It is true that we have to be careful how we interpret brute data.  I could have started by citing some very strong statistics that link religiosity with murder rates all over the World.  All over the World.  At any scale... religious regions have more murder, religious countries have more murder, religious continents have more murder.  Murder and religion are heavily correlated.  This does not, as Pro so rightly reminds us, imply causation.  Nobody should be saying that these statistics simply mean that 'religion causes murder'; that would be a grave error in interpretation.  But what's the alternative to this fallacious reasoning?  What is the underlying story that causes both murder and religion?  Perhaps it's poverty... perhaps it's political instability... perhaps it's violence.  Indeed, those three things are correlated with both murder and religion.  It's interesting to note, is it not, that religion thrives in hard times?  If one were being frightfully cynical, one might make a statement such as 'religion finds it easier to get its claws into the young, the old, the weak, the poor, the sick, the dying and the disenfranchised'.It upset me to read 'Zuckerman's broad-brushing of the issue smacks much more of bias than science'.  I did not attack the bias of Pro's sources, although well I might have done.  I withheld from such an attack without solid evidence.  I ask Pro to explain what evidence he has of Zuckerman's bias.  I have studied the report in detail and find, if anything, an admirable lack of bias.'When considering these kinds of statistics on a global scale, there are too many factors involved. One cannot take the stance of 'all things being equal.''Well put, Pro, well put.  It is very tricky to draw the right conclusions when studying something so complex as causation of effects in human society.  We must always remember exactly what questions we are seeking to ask, and we must be open to some explanations that put our statistics in a different light.Quite so, quite so.Here's a confounding factor: religions often (from their high horses of claimed love for all) preach against atheists.  Atheism is a moral wickedness, in many religions' eyes; indeed, false belief is really bad.  If we look at the Bronze Age writings that form the core of certain Abrahamic faiths, we find that the right thing to do to people who believe in the wrong God is to stone them to death.  Nice, that, isn't it, for religions that claim to be peace-loving, tolerant, modern and enlightened?Let me remind the gentle audience of what the bible has to say about that:Psalm 14:1The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.”  -  They are corrupt, they do abominable deeds,  -  there is none who does good.Deuteronomy 13:6-9If your brother, your mother’s son, or your son or daughter, or the wife you cherish, or your friend who is as your own soul, entice you secretly, saying, ‘Let us go and serve other gods’ (whom neither you nor your fathers have known, of the gods of the peoples who are around you, near you or far from you, from one end of the earth to the other end),  you shall not yield to him or listen to him; and your eye shall not pity him, nor shall you spare or conceal him.  But you shall surely kill him; your hand shall be first against him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.(An enquiring reader might also read Deuteronomy 17:2-5)Bear in mind that there are people who believe that the bible is the literal Word of God and is inerrant and infallible.Either way, it remains true that some once-religious people who 'come out' as atheists lose their friends, their families and their jobs (especially in America).  Now, would it not be fair to factor this kind of effect into any discussion on the effects of religion?  I mean, if people lived longer and happier as part of a Mafia group in a certain region because of the effects of that Mafia on non-members, should we conclude that the group makes the World a better place?  I should think not!Thus I suggest that the fairest thing we should be doing is comparing countries that are mostly atheistic to countries that are mostly theistic to get an impartial assessment without conflicting effects.  This has the added bonused of beating potentially biased surveys and including very large numbers of people in the mix... this produces accuracy.  I invite Pro to raise the debate to this level.  I note with joy that Pro's second link does exactly this: it makes the case that poverty causes religion.  Now, it's interesting reading, and it asks us a new question: is it true that religion alleviates the depravations of extreme poverty?  I assume that Pro thinks that it does (I do not) but I invite Pro to address this more interesting question.Pro says 'Zuckerman's article mentions that the most religious states, such as Alabama and Louisiana, have the highest rates of murder. They also tend to have high rates of gun ownership and lax laws [5]' - again, I ask: please could we get to the beating heart of the issue by asking what the reason is for a correllation between gun ownership and religion; or lax laws and religion?  What's really going on?I couldn't find a nice description of the raw facts on the internet, so I've composed my own, based on the most populous countries in the World (gt;100,000,000 people).  I include population, degree of religiosity and intentional homicide rate (per 100,000 people per year)China (1.4 billion) - 41% religious - murder rate 1India (1.3 billion) - 84% religious - murder rate 3.5US (0.32 billion) - 66% religious - murder rate 4.7Indonesia (0.26 billion) - 81% religious - murder rate 0.6Brazil (0.20 billion) - 92% religious - murder rate 25Pakistan (0.19 billion) - 98% religious - murder rate 7.7Nigeria (0.18 billion) - 98% religious - murder rate 20Bangladesh (0.16 billion) - 99% religious - murder rate 2.7Russia (0.15 billion) - 58% religious - murder rate 9.2Japan (0.13 billion) - 29% religious - murder rate 0.3Mexico (0.12 billion) - 56% religious - murder rate 21.5Philippines (0.10 billion) - 95% religious - murder rate 8.8As you can see, there is a positive correlation between religiosity and murder rate.  Now, I am not making the fallacy of jumping straight to 'therefore religion causes murder' - what I am saying, though, is that if you want to be sure that 'religion makes the World a better place', you've got an awful lot of work to do explaining why it seems to be the other way around.In Nigeria, half the Muslim community agree with the death penalty for leaving Islam and there are regions with strict apostasy laws.In Pakistan, 64% of the population want the death penalty for converting from Islam [1].In Bangladesh, it's a much more tolerant 36% of people who think that men, women and children should be killed for non-belief [1].If you add up the populations of Pakistan and Bangladesh, you get more than the population of the US.  Looking at these people, about 50% are convinced that it is the morally correct thing to do to kill people who lose their faith.  I don't think that you can fairly ignore these facts when asking 'does religion make the World a better place?'.[1] I am going to use the next round to further the case that religion, in fact, makes the World a worse place.  I will use Round 5 for summing up and final rebuttals.  I just thought that I'd give Pro a chance to focus a little more globally before I brought the big guns out :)</t>

    <t>Once again, my apologies for my prior forfeit. Thanks to Con's generosity in giving me some extra time to respond, I've been able to examine their argument a little more completely. Having done so, I find myself in the interesting position of having to defend the specific beliefs, as opposed to the practices, of Islam—a religion I do not personally subscribe to—and given some of Con's sources, I admit that I'm not sure I'm able to. I was not aware of the statistics regarding the acceptance of stoning apostates in Islam, and I must say I find them rather concerning. I am not familiar enough with the Koran to determine whether this sort of devotion to Sharia law is justified in the text, or whether it counts as extremism, so I can't comment one way or the other. If this concession is enough to lose me the debate, then fair enough; I truly can't defend it.However, the Psalms are poems, meaning that vivid imagery and anecdotal descriptions should be expected, and as far as the verses from Deuteronomy cited by Con, they speak specifically of apostasy within the nation of Israel based on their covenant with God, not seeking out nonbelievers from other nations, which seems to be what a lot of people assume. This covenant is null and void in the Christian faith due to the sacrifice of Christ, and as far as Judaism is concerned, the general consensus is that while the death penalty may be moral in theory, it should not be put into practice (not to mention that the standards of evidence required to even convict a “guilty” person are so steep that it's virtually impossible anyway) [1]. Additionally, if a Christian makes grand proclaimations about the bible's commands to love one's neighbor before marching off to hate their neighbors, I'm not sure the blame for that lies with religion so much as human hypocrisy.It's definitely true that atheists have been mistreated by religious people on the basis of their nonbelief, but it's very much incorrect to assume that those discovered to be religious aren't similarly mocked, abused, and discriminated against by atheists (although less frequently, I imagine, given atheism's comparatively small demographic). The rise of the movement dubbed “New Atheism” seems to operate on a platform that the religious deserve to be treated this way.Con asks 'is it true that religion alleviates the depravations of extreme poverty? I assume that Pro thinks that it does (I do not) but I invite Pro to address this more interesting question.” Admittedly, I'm not sure what Con means by this. The source I provided seems to make a good case for religion having a positive effect on those suffering poverty, and as Con has not explained what leads them to believe otherwise, I can't be sure what point they intended me to address. The circumstances of extreme poverty? Its causes? Its effects? On a personal level, or a societal one? Con suggests that “It's interesting to note, is it not, that religion thrives in hard times? If one were being frightfully cynical, one might make a statement such as 'religion finds it easier to get its claws into the young, the old, the weak, the poor, the sick, the dying and the disenfranchised.'” One may very well make such a statement, as it certainly bears to be considered. But one may also appeal to the words of Jesus Christ and note that “it is not the healthy that need a doctor, but the sick.” The disenfranchised have more reason to wonder if an ultimate justice will be served than those who are privileged. The old and the dying have more reason to wonder what comes after death than those who have decades left. The poor and the sick have more reason to seek miraculous help than those who aren't suffering. Maybe religion finds the downtrodden because they're the ones actively looking for the answers it provides.In the same vein of frightful cynicism, however, one might suggest that atheism finds it easier to get its respective claws into those who refuse to bend the knee to any authority besides themselves—after all, if there's no God, what authority could be higher than one's own? This would certainly serve as an explanation as to why so many regimes marked by unspeakable violence and bloodshed at the hands of their governments in the last century or so have been spearheaded by avowed atheists (the usual suspects being Josef Stalin, Mao Tse-Tung, and Pol Pot, but let's not forget Enver Hoxha, Fidel Castro, Mengistu, Mussolini, and Kim Il-Sung, among others). And while we're asking questions, can people who reject religion's gods, and nonetheless cling to the greater part of their moralities (a concept condemned by Nietzsche, and more recently, Michael Onfray) even claim their moral opinions as secular in the first place?As far as my claim about Zuckerman's bias, I didn't intend for it to be quite as harsh as it was apparently received. The way that he presented his statistics (at least to me) read as though Zuckerman was encouraging his readers to conclude that religion causes murder without any attempt at elaboration, which we have both agreed is not a fair assessment to make off-handedly with only the brute data.Con's chart of religiosity and murder rates doesn't seem to be accounting for Eastern Religions. If I'm not mistaken, Shinto is the dominant belief system in Japan, and China has a large number of Taoists. As for the rest, I would hold that extreme poverty, illegal drug and gang activity, and low human development would account for the violence in most of the countries listed, and that religious belief could easily result from the effects of that violence, as stated above. That seems to me like it would be sufficient to explain the correlation.However, one question I think is central to this debate is at what point, exactly, could we count the benefits of religion as greater than its sins? Does the number of lives saved by religious altruism make up for the lives lost to religious extremism, for instance? And can religious extremism be considered true religion, since its actions (in every case I'm aware of) go directly against the teachings it claims to espouse?I'm afraid I ran out of time to locate better-rounded sources as requested, but I would suggest acquisition of the Handbook of Religion and Health from Oxford Press for a collection of meta-studies on the correlation of religiosity and quality of life.</t>

    <t>I freely admit that my sources for Round 1 are less than ideal. Given that I have the burden of proof in this scenario, I didn't want to start things off by waxing philosophical. However, I found myself rather hampered in the sources I was able to provide due to much of the information I would have liked to cite being in physical journals or books, which I am obviously unable to provide links to (and I hardly expect Con or the voters to rush out and buy them to determine their information's reliability).Additionally, most of the research on the topic of religion's correlation with better health (which is, in itself, a fairly young area of study) comes from the United States. I recognize that this debate is focused on a global scale, but as there is so far a paucity of resources as far as the world at large is concerned, I hoped that my opponent would at least consider American statistics to be worth considering. If so, I can endeavour to find studies with more representative subject pools should Con request it. If not, I am more than happy to move on to a different argument. I will leave that up to my opponent.I would like to begin by commenting on Con's argument about the crime rates of religious countries. An interesting feature of the globe's most religious countries is that many of them are in the developing world. Nations such as Mali, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Côte d'Ivoire, and Senegal, for instance, all marked in dark reds on Con's map of religiosity, are included in the Nations Online Project's list of countries with the poorest human development [1] (and, while it may be tempting to conclude from this that religion causes poverty, it's actually the other way around [2]).Even in more affluent places like Europe, the statistic doesn't stand across the board. Eurostat reports: “Homicides are most prevalent in the Baltic States: Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. However, they are relatively rare in some southern EU countries (Malta, Italy, Spain) and Austria, Norway, Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden [3].” Interestingly, Estonia boasts the lowest number of religious adherents, whereas Malta has the highest [4]. Italy, Austria and Switzerland also have high levels of religiosity and low levels of atheism.I could also mention that Vietnam subscribes to state atheism and has massive numbers of non-believers—as well as significant issues with human rights.So let's take it down a peg further and look at the United States. Zuckerman's article mentions that the most religious states, such as Alabama and Louisiana, have the highest rates of murder. They also tend to have high rates of gun ownership and lax laws [5], which has been shown to correlate with higher rates of overall homicide in addition to gun deaths [6]. This could also serve as an explanation for why the United States has higher homicide rates than less religious countries such as Canada and Britain, where gun ownership is much more heavily restricted.In short, I would like to direct the readers' attention to what is known as the False Cause Fallacy, summed up nicely in the adage of “correlation does not imply causation.” Zuckerman's broad-brushing of the issue smacks much more of bias than science. If Con beseeches the reader to consider additional reasons for the correlation of atheism and suicide, I believe I have the right to request the same considerations for religiosity and murder rates. When considering these kinds of statistics on a global scale, there are too many factors involved. One cannot take the stance of “all things being equal.”As far as the “fewer atheists in prison” argument, there are a couple of problems. According to [7] (which seems to be the only place to list the findings of Golumbaski's original study, cited in Zuckerman's article), the religion of approximately 20% of inmates is unknown. That's a significant margin, and it could conceivably be composed of anything from no atheists to all atheists. Perhaps these “unknowns” refused to answer (which would raise the question of why), but perhaps they are non-believers who simply chose to tick the “other” box as opposed to the “atheist” one. We don't know. Additionally, these statistics do not account for conversions. We don't know how many atheists there were going in vs. coming out. Prison ministries are surprisingly common, and it's conceivable that there is a large percentage of people who come to faith in prison. As far as Con's points on suicide (ignoring my sources for the time being), I consider it to be vastly different from euthanasia as far as the ethics and complexity of the issue. The idea that 'suicide may not be universally bad' is a point I would certainly stand to disagree with, but euthanasia is a different story. However, this is not the debate at hand, so I hope that we won't get too caught up in it. I would also note that Con's comment that 'the idea that suicide is universally unacceptable seems to me an artefact of religion,' while perhaps partially true, is somewhat nearsighted. It bears remembering that even if suicide is in the best interests of the subject in question, it is very rarely in the best interests of their loved ones. The idea of suicide being universally unacceptable seems like a fairly understandable response to the pain and grief suffered by the victim's family and friends. After all, suicide victims do not have the luxury of explaining their reasoning. Even if religion had not played a part in the debate, it's possible that we would have drawn the same conclusions either way.</t>

<h>Thanks Pro for the opening arguments.Preface: - It should be noted that Pro’s Resolution is specific about eradicating poverty, not just reducing it. - Beside the utter lack of sources amp; support for his arguments, Pro has yet to argue for the eradication of poverty, as affirmed in his resolution. Case: I. Causes of Poverty: - Poverty, like ignorance amp; corruption, is a human condition entrenched in all societies past amp; present for it stems from causes that are inherent in the human psyche amp; rooted in the environment we live in. For brevity purposes we will limit the said causes to some of the more relevant ones: 1. Corruption: factor that makes it easy for the wealthy amp; authority to get richer at the expense of the poor, for there is a lock of higher authority to check the flow of wealth amp; thus the rules turn in favour of the fittest at the expense of the weakest [1]. Even Humanitarian Aid from rich countries (such as the US) to poor countries (such as sub-Saharan Africa) is damaged by corruption [2]. 2. Climate Change: a condition generally beyond human control: some areas have stable climate suitable for cultivating land, harvest amp; nurturing livestock, some others suffer from extreme unstable environments, heat, soil, rain. . . that disrupts the sustenance necessary for local populations, which in its turn creates amp; may even perpetuate Poverty.    3. Wars: a state of affairs that drains resources, human amp; economic, amp; destroys the socioeconomic structures that generate amp; distribute wealth, which also creates Poverty amp; prevent possible solution from being implemented to solve it. amp; wars are, too, a human condition existing as long as humans exist. 4. Natural Disasters: floods, volcanos, tsunamis, epidemics, earthquakes. . . all contribute in destroying both wealth amp; the structure that might preserve it. Cause that can not be eradicated, not by any human means. II. Reduction of Poverty vs Eradication of Poverty: - Pro’s contentions are almost all for the reduction of poverty, not for its eradication. Pro must provide a way through which the roots of Poverty can be eliminated for good, that if he wishes to support his resolution. - Furthermore, even in case a particular society was seemingly successful in eliminating poverty with itself, that would not imply its automatic success in eradicating it. That is because such achievements are contingent to a very specific circumstances of time amp; place amp; overall socioeconomic situation unlikely, even impossible, to form a perpetual state.  Rebuttals: - The only argument provided by Pro seemingly supporting his resolution, that is eradicating Poverty as opposed to suppressing it, is the following: “The argument that we have not ended poverty yet is not an argument that it can't ever be done.”  - I certainly do not agree, for the above statement is inductively false. If, so far, we haven’t been able to end Poverty, then, inductively, that’s a good reason to believe that we never will. Believing there is a chance to end Poverty for good warrants, at the very least, as good a counter-argument as the above pure inductive argument is. An anology could be made with the following example: 1. So far the sun rises from the east. 2. The sun tomorrow will rise from the east. 3.

    <t>Rebuttals:the fact we have reduced it puts us in a better position to be able to eradicate the remaining poverty. There is a relatively small number left to help (in some countries) making it more manageable- Pro’s proposition here is invalid, for:1. It’s a straw man fallacy! Arguing for reducing poverty does not help the case of eradicating it!2. His assumptions are grossly inaccurate: 1.1 billion people have inadequate access to water, 2.6 billion lack basic sanitation, 1.6 billion live without electricity, 1 in ever 2 children is in poverty. Poverty is very much rampant, unmanageable should be the more adequate word to describe it [1].Every invention could have easily been dismissed as not possible because it had not happened in the thousands of years before.- Pro is confusing argument from ignorance [2] with inductive reasoning [3].1. Every raven, so far, is black. Therefore, all ravens are black. =gt; This is an inductive argument.2. Every unicorn, so far, is cute. Therefore, all unicorns are cute. =gt; This is a argument from ignorance.=gt; In (1) we have a positive factual claim, as in supported by real evidence, whereas in (2) we have no real evidence.=gt; So far, poverty exists. Therefore, poverty always exists.Corruption is responsible for a relatively small share of the illicit money flow from developing countries.- Pro’s contention here is invalid, for:1. It’s a bare assertion, unsupported by his own source: “multinational companies steal more than $900bn from developing countries each year through tax evasion and other illicit practices.”2. Corruption, political or moral, is indeed one of major causes of poverty. Internally, it pushes Man into becoming ever greedy, thus not only does it prevent them from sharing wealth (i.e. preventing the reduction of Poverty) but it also initiates Poverty by compelling them to appropriate the wealth of others. Externally, it allows for even more lack of sharing amp; wrongful appropriation, thus a perpetual disparity of wealth: “In 1960, the 20% of the world’s people in the richest countries had 30 times the income of the poorest 20%, in 1997, 74 times as much”, “0.13% of the world’s population controlled 25% of the world’s financial assets in 2004” [1].- Also, corruption being in constant change is not reason enough to believe it can be eradicated! The world can counter the negative impacts of nature.- Countering the negative impacts does not imply eradicating them. Natural disasters have far reaching economic consequences [4]. Katrina for instance cost $108Bn amp; left hundreds of thousands unemployed [5], amp; millions homeless [6].Wars are becoming less frequent and deadly.- Again, bare assertion amp; non-supportive to Pro’s resolution, for:1. Less wars does not imply no more wars!2. Throughout history we had long periods of peace, amp; also long periods of war, successively. Such as WWI amp; WWII followed by the declaration of the UN [7].3. Currently, the World’s military expenditure amounts to 2.3% of its GDP ($1776Bn) [8].=gt; Wars cause poverty, prevents its reduction amp; there is no reason to believe they can ever be eradicated.If […] the past is a good indicator of the future then those countries are looking good for the future.- Countries having had some success in a relatively short historical period (one century or less), does not imply they will have the same success perpetually! No civilisation has ever always stayed on top.Conclusion:- Pro’s entire case is a series of  bare assertions amp; straw man. He argues for reducing poverty amp; extrapolates to eradicating it! His sources are either non-existent or non-supportive. His arguments are contradicted by the facts. He has thus thoroughly failed to carry his BOP. Thus I win the debate.=gt; Vote Con.</t>

    <t>Hello,  I respectfully disagree that I focused on reducing it instead of eradication. I made the specific point that the fact we have reduced it puts us in a better position to be able to eradicate the remaining poverty. There is a relatively small number left to help (in some countries) making it more manageable hopefully and we have a successful foundation to build on. (Being the lessons learnt about what works).  I apologize for only referencing the organizations that I got my information from instead of specific links to each fact. (I have included them this time} I did mention the sources of information though in my last post and searching their sites will produce the info for those interested). I would also say the rebuttal to my statement that just because it has not been eradicated yet is not a strong one. Every invention and medical breakthrough in the 20th century could have easily been dismissed as not possible because it had not happened in the thousands of years before the 20th century.  Corruption is responsible for a relatively small share of the illicit money flow from developing countries. It also does not account for most of the poverty in rich countries. Unemployment, underemployment and low pay play much bigger roles there. There are also mechanisms to reduce corruption like Partnership in Transparency Fund {a charity}. Corruption itself does not mean the money that does make it can not work. Foreign aid still has plenty of success stories. The varying corruption rates across the globe and the changing list of most corrupt countries indicates that corruption is not some unchangeable part of nature but changes based on changeable factors  Blaming global warning and natural disasters for poverty is unfair. No doubt it makes things worse for farmers but there is a reason why Australia had the worse drought in 100 years and it did not result in mass starvation and death. It is not just about nature. The world can counter the negative impacts of nature. GMO crops are one way to partly protect against nature. Drought-resistant crops for example. The Commission for Africa although noting global warning is a problem for development pointed out many more man made issues like the need for storage facilities. Irrigation of land and the like.  Professor Steve Pinker notes that wars are becoming less frequent and deadly. We have also had times of relative peace like Pax Romana. Historians have also noted that war has not always occurred since the start of history. And countries like Switzerland and the pacifism movement demonstrates to me that war is not some inherent part of human nature that can't ever be changed.  I argue that no strong case has been made that, 'inunshakeable physical and mental realities..' mean that we can't see the end to poverty. Con makes a good point that just because something is possible now does not mean that might be the case in the future. I would argue there are already countries that have had decades of relatively low poverty and if Con's argument is that the past is a good indicator of the future {aka because we have not ended poverty in the past means...} then those countries are looking good for the future.  Full-time employment {that pays well} is one of the best ways to keep people out of poverty and as long as the government {or international community} can afford to pay for full-employment public works programs then there is a strong case that poverty could always stay gone. Mechanisms already exist to ensure long-term funding for programs. Sovereign wealth funds and compulsory superannuation funds as some examples. </t>

    <t>Thanks for accepting the debate. I will try my best.  We know that we can significantly reduce poverty because there are countries that have done it like Norway and Denmark. So I would argue that ending the relatively low amount of remaining poverty is not beyond possibility. {The money to do it is definitively there in the case of Norway. Norway has a sovereign wealth fund in the hundreds of billions that could be used to directly give every poor person in Norway enough money to have a socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions}.  We know that countries like America have been able to drive the poverty rate down by a significant margin. {Take during the early days of the war on poverty}. So again I would make the argument that a country could build on that by doing things already proved by independent evaluators to be effective. Critical time-intervention to tackle homelessness, expanding the nurse-family partnership and career academies as examples. {Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy has info on these programs}.  We know the sums of money to provide food is relatively affordable {for governments or business}. The cost of school meals for kids in developing countries for example is within the billions a year and not the hundreds of billions. {According to the World Food Programme}. We know there is enough food to go around according to hunger charities so it is not about there not being enough food in the world or resources of governments to pay for that food that sees people in the world going without an adequate amount of food. The argument that we have not ended poverty yet is not an argument that it can't ever be done.  So for me this shows that we can/it is possible to end poverty and to ensure it does not come back.  I would argue there is enough evidence to show the world would be a better place without poverty. The impact that poverty has on the bottom-line. The Centre for American Progress estimates that childhood poverty alone in the US costs about 500 billion a year. Poverty is an underlying cause of human trafficking according to the United Nations. It is the underlying cause of a significant amount of bad health outcomes in America and around the world. {The latter according to the World Health Organization}. It is a cause of low educational achievement because poor kids are less likely to do well in school because of poverty. These are just some of the problems. So I would argue this shows why it would be a good thing to eradicate poverty.</t>

    <t>Contention 1: No Major/any CO2 Increase.      Many Global Warming advocates state that CO2 levels are skyrocketing, but that is incorrect. I give you the above graph measuring the past 600 million years of CO2 levels are we are actually at an all time low. Now the website I got this from no longer has this page up so I appologize. We can see from observance of this graph that we being at all time CO2 low levles that we are nowhere close to meeting the impact that my opponent brings up. We have been over 5,000 ppm of CO2 in our atmosphere and are now currently around apprx. 350 ppm CO2 levels.  The above graph shows that comparisions of C13 (Carbon isotope) and this shows that there is little to no trend pertrade in many of these as the average is zero while the trend for all of these are zero. (1) This is important as the Carbon isotope is important in measuring this so called 'Global Warming.'  This chart above shows the CO2 and Earth's temperatures for the past 600 million years. My opponent's claims are incorect as we have had aburd levels of CO2 and temperature on Earth and may I ask how did we survive that? (2) Now I will move on to how Earth is actually cooling and how it's temperature is cooler than it has been. Contention 2: Earth is cooling.  If we observe the above graph we can see that Earth has been a whole lot hotter than where we currently are to the point where the Earth's average temperature has been 7.5 degrees Celcuis hotter than it currently it is. You can also see that in the span of the past 10,000 years the temperature has leveld off, but you may ask yourself where does that place us in the lights of modern day?  I am going to site Dr. Done Easterbrook, who is a climate scientist. Back in 2000 he predicted that Earth was entering a cooling phase. He predicts that for the next 20 years Earth will cool by 3/10 degree each year and that we are going to enter another little Ice Age like we did from 1650 and 1790. (3) The funny thing is that many of my opponent's charts are actually from the incorrect IPPC. How about the 'Hockey Stick' graph that many Global Warming supporters , including my opponent, argue about? Well if we observe the fallowing chart taken from Northern Scandenavia we can see that the Global trend over the past 1,000 years that the Global Cooling trend slope is that of -0.31 Degrees Celcuis, give or take 0.03 degrees (for the error room). Professor Dr. Jan Esper has found that the Earth's temperature of Earth actually decreases 0.3 per millenia due to the Earth moving away from the sun. (4)   Here is another graph from 1920 to 2005 and we can see that the graph has a negative temperature slope, thus meaning that the Earth is under a period of cooling. (5)  You can see in terms of more Warming in the evidence in which Scientists use Ice Cores Earth has actually been Cooling the past Mellenium.  Finailly, lets bring up just how much these accused compounds exactly warm the Earth's atmosphere. CO2 for example has the global warming potential of 1. Here are the other numbers. Carbon Dioxide -- 1Methane -- 21Nitrous Oxide -- 298-310CFC's -- VariousWater Vapor -- 0.25 Now I just want you to keep this in mind for this next part here. We may observe that humans release approximately 35 gigatons of CO2 a year. [14] This is only 4.3% of the total amount of all Global Warming Gasses, however it is incrediably small when it comes to comparing the rest of the Global Warming gasses. If we observe the chart bellow we can see that Water Vapor is a large Contributor to Global Warming at 95% and CO2 comes in second. But here's the kicker. If we look at the Human contributed part that I'm about to post in the graph bellow we can see that it's very miniscule of 0.117% of all total Warming gasses. Now let's do some quick math here. CO2's increase was from what my opponent is claiming is from 295 ppm to 400ppm, a total of only 105 ppm. 1 Gigaton of CO2 is the equilivent of 2.13 ppm. [15] This means that increase of 105 ppm means a total of 49.29 gigatons. Since 1 gigaton of CO2 is the equivilance of .004% of the Greenhouse effect that means that 49.29 gigatons means an aditional .21% increase to Global Warming. This would account for a grand total of a 0.15 F increase in global temperature. This is a very measly amount and we can see that with my opponent's claims a simple 0.15 F increase isn't enough to melt glacers and have the effeccts that he is speaking of and it proves that this is NAUTRAL not man-made to fulfil his effects if they were real. Now remind yourself that this debate is about humans creating a LARGE amount of Global Warming, not a miniscule amount. You can see that in terms of Gasses contribution to the Green House Effect the major contributer is Water Vapor and it's at 95% to CO2's 3.6% and this is the overall contribution including man made and natural. When we look to the chart on the left we can see that Man-Made CO2 does have a higher contribution to the atmosphere than Water Vapor, but that's because we do not create much water vapor as humans. Even with this evidence we can see that CO2 does not have any effect what-so-ever compared to Water Vapor. (6) Where might those CFCs be on this graph you may ask. Why it's under the Misc. gases section. Contention 3: Artic Ice. Al Gore stated that the Artic Ice would be completely melted by 2014, but he is incorrect then and now.  Jan. 6, 2012: The Coast Guard Cutter Healy breaks ice around the Russian-flagged tanker Renda 250 miles south of Nome. The Healy is the Coast Guard’s only currently operating polar icebreaker. The vessels are transiting through ice up to five-feet thick in this area. The 370-foot tanker Renda will have to go through more than 300 miles of sea ice to get to Nome, a city of about 3,500 people on the western Alaska coastline that did not get its last pre-winter fuel delivery because of a massive storm. (7) Let's go back to 2007-2008 and see if his claim was justified in the Artic Ice activity.  Hmmm... It seems that he is incorrect, but let's look further into the near past. How about 2012-2013? (8) We all remember the Climate Scientists that got stuck in Arctic Ice Earlier last year correct? Then a Russian Ice Breaker tried to free them, but got stuck. Can you guess what they were studying? They had predicted that all the Arctic Ice had melted due to Global Warming and that Earth would get flooded massively. Boy were they wrong. (9)  (10)  Dr. Koonin, former head of the Department of Energy under President Obama, has stated that the Global Warming scare is not suttle. This is because that he has found 3 things wrong and highly incorrect about the scare. 1. Shrinking of Artic Sea ice doesn't acount for the gaining of the Antartic ice. 2. The warming of Earth's temps today is the same as it was 30 years ago. 3. The sea levels rose at the same height and rate in the 20th cenury. (11) Contention 4: Sea Levels Here is another corralation that must happen. If the Ice Caps are completely melted as many GW advocates claim then the sea level would have risen completely drowning tons of land.  The graph above is raw satellite image data of the sea level rise over an 8 year period showing that there is little to no change in the Sea Levels rising. (12) The sea level rises, on average, about 3 inches per century and it has been found to not even been rising at all.  This graph is the sea levels off the cost of French Guyana which is one of the areas which is predicted to be flooded due to Global Warming, but as you can see by the graph (which goes to 2008) the sea level is currently on a downward trend. (13) The source is the PDF within the link.Contention 5: The WeatherMany Global Warming Advocates claim that Hurricanes are increasing due to Global Warming, but this claim is indeed false! The hurricanes since the year 1900 to 2008 have actually been decreasing. The slope of this downward slope is .0016. Though it is small the hurricanes are still in a downward trend.As a matter of fact not only are Hurricanes on a downward trend, but they are at an all time low as in the year 2010, there was only 68 Hurricanes Globally, which is an all time low in the past 40 years. How about Tornados you may ask?In the graph above you can see that tornados are at an all time low in the past 60 years! (14) But what about Hurricanes?Here is a graph showing the number of days between hurricanes and this shows that the number of days between hurricanes is greatest at 76 days between hurricanes.The slope of this line is zero showing no trend of a massive storm increase. </t>

  <pair id="344" entailment="ENTAILMENT" task="IE">
    <t>I would like to thank lannan13 for posting his arguments.No Major CO2 IncreaseThis is true. CO2 levels have been higher. But what were the climactic conditions during those periods? 'The last time carbon dioxide levels were apparently as high as they are today - and were sustained at those levels - global temperatures were 5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit higher than they are today, the sea level was approximately 75 to 120 feet higher than today, there was no permanent sea ice cap in the Arctic and very little ice on Antarctica and Greenland.' Clearly, the levels that CO2 is reaching are unsustainable.[1]The reason the CO2 rise is considered high is because the CO2 level is the highest in around 50 million years. And it only took 150 years to get that way. So, while the CO2 level is not as high as it has been, the climate was much warmer then, and the CO2 rise is large in the large scale.CO2/Temperature CorrelationCO2 does not correlate exactly with temperature. However, if we consider CO2 and the sun, the correlation is almost perfect. The sun has not caused the most recent spurt of global warming, so it must be concluded that the rising CO2 levels are causing global warming.[2][3]The graph below shows the two forcings plotted against temperature:Further, my opponent's correlation graph is inaccurate. It forgets the huge uncertainty early on.This graph shows the uncertainty:With this uncertainty, Robert Berner (the author of the study and graph), said himself, 'Eexact values of CO2... should not be taken literally.' That correlation graph should not be taken seriously. The better one is the first graph above, that shows that CO2 has a big effect on the climate. Berner also said in the same study, '...over the long term there is indeed a correlation between CO2 and paleotemperature...'[4][5]The Earth's Current Climactic TrendMy opponent's studies are based on faulty data sets and misunderstandings about how the climate works. Different data sets show the Earth is warming, and the Earth's climactic indicators show that the Earth is still warming.For one thing, my opponent's temperature graphs are based off of RSS data. UAH and HADCRUT4 data both show that the Earth has been continuing to warm throughout the last 15 years.[6][7] For another, it was found that the heat content of the Earth is increasing. 'This new research combines measurements of oceanheat, land and atmosphere warming and ice melting to find that our climate system continued to accumulate heat through to 2008... Since 1970, the Earth's heat content has been rising at a rate of 6 x 10^21 Joules per year.' If you look back to my first round, you'll see my point that excess CO2 traps heat, and this is exactly what we're seeing[8][9]:Further, if we focus on surface and lower troposphere temperatures (just where we'd expect there to be warming), we see that the warming trend continues. 'Foster and Rahmstorf (2011) used multiple linear regression to filter out the effects of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and solar and volcanic activity (Figure 2), and found that the underlying global surface and lower atmospherewarming trends have remained very steady in recent years.'[8][10]:The hockey stick continues to stick because there's no evidence that there were any periods for at least the last 2500 years that indicate that the climate was warmer then than it is now. The hockey stick was been replicated numerous times. This graph still appears to be the real story when it comes to the recent climate[11]:Interestingly, my opponent's 'Greenland GISP2 Ice Core - Temperature last 10,000 years' graph cuts off at 1850.[12]Water VaporMy opponent is correct that water vapor is the most important greenhouse gas. However, water vapor only acts as an amplifier of other warming. Water vapor levels can't be raised. However, since CO2 levels can, the warming that follows is amplified by water vapor in the atmosphere. In other words, it's a positive feedback (see my first argument), not a cause of warming in and of itself.[13]Arctic Ice LevelsThe claim that the arctic sea ice would be completely gone was an apocalyptic one that did not turn out to be true. However, it is still known that the levels of sea ice are decreasing. See the below graph:'The blue line represents the trend calculated from January 1 1979 to the most recent date indicated on the figure. Monthly averaged ice volume for September 2014 was 6,970 km. This value is 40% lower than the mean over this period, 59% lower than the maximum in 1979, and 0.7 standard deviations above the 1979-2013 trend.' The arctic sea ice levels are decreasing.[14]As for the Antarctic sea ice claim, while the sea ice is gaining in extent, it is decreasing in mass. This is the result of a complex set of scenarios.[15]This graph shows the loss in Antarctic ice mass:[16]The claim that the temperature are warming at the same rate doesn't change the fact that increasing CO2 levels are behind the warming. As for the claim that arctic sea ice levels are rising at the same level, this is blatantly false, as the graph below shows:[17]Sea LevelsIt is true that the sea ice melting portends rising sea levels. However, the sea level is actually increasing. Looking at the sea level for an eight year period hardly shows a long-term trend, especially when there's variation in the climate. The sea level rise in French Guiana would not have inundated the country. Further, there's also variation in the sea level rise in different places.When the global data is analyzed, a clear trend of sea level rise is seen. 'To construct a global historical record of sea levels, tide gauge records are taken from locations away from plate boundaries and subject to little isostatic rebound. This has been done in A 20th century acceleration in global sea-level rise (Church 2006) which reconstructs global sea level rise from tide gauges across the globe.'[18][19]:What can be seen is that the sea levels are rising, and that the increase is accelerating. Relying on isolated events and short-term trends does not answer the question of whether sea levels are rising as a whole globally.The WeatherThe correlation between global warming and weather is much more complex than my opponent gives the anthropogenic global warming theory credit for. For one thing, storms rely on many more variables than just temperature, especially tornadoes. 'Then there are problems unique to tornadoes. Beyond knowing that they require a certain type of wind shear, meteorologists just don’t know much about why some thunderstorms generate tornadoes and others don’t.' If we don't understand why certain thunderstorms create tornadoes, then we are in no place to analyze the correlation between tornadoes and one variable. We simply just don't know enough yet here.[20]Hurricanes can be better analyzed, because they are more dependent on ocean temperatures than tornadoes are on land temperatures. Higher temperatures won't necessarily lead to more hurricanes, but they will lead to stronger hurricanes. 'The Power Dissipation Index is found to increase since the mid-1970s, due to both longer and more intense storms. Hurricane intensity is also highly correlated with sea surface temperature. This suggests that future warming will lead to an increase in the destructive potential of tropical hurricanes.'[21][22]The below graph shows this:The correlation is clear here. Further, it was found that while the number of lower-intensity hurricanes has stayed about the same, the number of higher-intensity hurricanes has increased for this very reason. The greater number of hurricanes seen would be small, considering most hurricanes are lower-intensity.[23]SourcesSources in comments.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank lannan13 for accepting this debate.Human-Emitted Greenhouse GasesIt is known that CO2 levels are increasing. 'In pre-industrial times over the last 10,000 years, CO2 was relatively stable at around 275 to 285 parts per million. Over the last 250 years, atmospheric CO2 levels have increased by about 100 parts per million.' CO2 levels are increasing at a level not seen in at least 500,000 years, if not longer.[1]Here is a graph showing CO2 concentrations over the last 10000 years:[2][3]This excess CO2 traps heat. Satellites measure less heat escaping out to space, at the particular wavelengths that CO2 absorbs heat, thus finding '...direct experimental evidence for a significant increase in the Earth's greenhouse effect.' In other words, the Earth is retaining more of the heat that it receives from the sun that it received from before. This excess heat manifests itself through global temperature increases.[4]'If less heat is escaping to space, where is it going? Back to the Earth's surface. Surface measurements confirm this, observing more downward infrared radiation. A closer look at the downward radiation finds moreheat returning at CO2 wavelengths, leadin to the conclusion that '...this experimental data should effectively end the argument by skeptics that no experimental evidence exists for the connection between greenhouse gas increases in the atmosphere and global warming.''[5][6]CO2 correlates with temperature. Consider the Cenozoic era (the last 65 million years). Overall, solar activity increased 0.4% over this period. 'Because Earth absorbs about 240 W/m^2 of solar energy, that brightness increase is a forcing of about 1 W/m^2. This small linear increase of forcing, by itself, would have caused a modest global warming through the Cenozoic Era.' The CO2 levels caused a much higher forcing. In contrast, atmospheric CO2 during the Cenozoic changed from at least 1000 ppm in the early Cenozoic to as small as 170 ppm during recent ice ages. The resulting climate forcing, as can be computed accurately for this CO2 range using formulae in Table 1 of Hansen et al. (2000), exceeds 10 W/m^2. It is clear that CO2 was the dominant climate forcing in the Cenozoic.'[7]In fact, the temperature changes correspond to the CO2 changes. '...there is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr.'[8]This graph shows the CO2-temperature correlation over the last 700,000 years:Indeed, it would be rather coincidental if the recent rise in global warming happened to start just around the time that humans started to emit large quantities of greenhouse gases. However, there is direct evidence as well, in addition to the already established correlation between temperature and CO2.One piece of evidence is a comparison of warming in the troposphere and stratosphere. Because the CO2 is in the upper troposphere, the troposphere temperature would increase, while the stratospheric temperature would decrease, because there would be less heat reaching the stratosphere. 'Computer model estimates of the ‘human influence’ fingerprint are broadly similar to the observed pattern. In sharp contrast, model simulations of internal and total natural variability cannot produce the same sustained, large-scale warming of the troposphere and cooling of the stratosphere.'[9][10]This graph shows this:[5]Another piece of evidence is the frequency of cold days and nights. Because the sun only shines in the day time, is the sun was causing global warming, the days would warm faster than the nights, while if greenhouse gases were causing global warming, this wouldn't be observed. It is the latter's prediction that is observed. 'What we observe is a decrease in cold nights greater than the decrease in cold days, and an increase in warm nights greater than the increase in warm days.'[5][11]This can be shown in the below graph:[5]Overall, the evidence shows that human-emitted greenhouse gases are the cause of global warming. CO2, in addition to other gases like methane and nitrous oxide are being emitted by humans in very large amounts, and this is manifesting itself in an increase in the average global temperature.Climate Sensitivity and FeedbacksClimate sensitivity is the amount the temperature would rise if the CO2 concentration were doubled. Obviously, if there's a large climate sensitivity, then increases in CO2 have large effect. It is known that the climate sensitivity is around 1 degree C. However, this can be amplified through feedbacks. Positive ones amplify the sensitivity, while negative ones diminish the sensitivity. The evidence overwhelmingly comes down on the former, that positive feedbacks are happening. Increases in CO2 cause temperature increases, which are amplified by water vapor and the effect on clouds.'Since the radiative effects associated with the buildup of water vapor to near-saturation levels and the subsequent condensation into clouds are far stronger than the equilibrium level of radiative forcing by the non-condensing GHGs, this results in large local fluctuations in temperature about the global equilibrium value.'[12]This can be shown in the below graph:Further, increases in CO2 affect the carbon cycle in this way:Global warming can result in the death of vegetation (due to droughts) and the warming of the ocean. Both of these further reduce the maximum absorption of the Earths carbon cycle, thus resulting in even more CO2 being released into the atmosphere. And with this, CO2 increases even more. In other words, CO2-caused temperature increases are amplified by positive feedbacks and the mechanics of the carbon cycle.So, the positive feedback amplifies the climate sensitivity. How much it is amplified can be determined through study. Using a Bayesian statistical approach, which is “the dominant [method] in the literature”, these findings support the notion of climate sensitivity as maximum 4 degrees C, a mean of 3 degrees C, and likely not lower than 3 degrees.[13]The graph below gives a statistical analysis:[14]The mean is around 3 degrees C.  The CO2 that humans emit thus has an effect of 3 degrees C per doubling of CO2. This can be shown by the fact that CO2 concentrations have increased from around 275 ppm to around 400 ppm. This is an increase of around 40%. This should manifest itself with a temperature increase of a little less than 1.5 degrees C. Indeed, temperatures have increased around this amount over the last 150 years. The anthropogenic-forcing climate models thus match observations.[15]In other words, in addition to the direct evidence of how the Earth is warming, the climate models based on a greenhouse gas cause to global warming explain almost perfectly the recent global warming. This is a lot of evidence for a human case to the recent global warming.ConclusionGreenhouse gases cause global warming because of their heat trapping abilities. Humans have been emitting vast amounts of greenhouse gases over the last 150 years, and this shows itself on the CO2 measurements. The atmospheric warming pattern and greater heating at night are evidence that the recent global warming is caused by those human emitted greenhouse gases. These increases are amplified through the water vapor and cloud positive feedbacks and the positive feedback that arises through the climate cycle. The climate sensitivity ends up being around 3 degrees C. Finally, the CO2-temperature record shows that the two correlate with remarkable correlation.SourcesSources in comments.</t>

    <t>There are some minor issues in conduct with my opponent's constructive case, but I'm not going to dwell on them. Primarily, this argument remains unaltered from when my opponent last debated this issue, which means he has left in irrelevant rebuttals, albeit to the wrong opponent.R1: No Major/any CO2 Increase.In the previous round, I preemptively refuted this first claim that historically higher carbon dioxide are relevant. In fact, as you will see, they are, if anything, evidence in favour of carbon dioxide's effect on temperature, which Con later attempts to refute.'Many skeptics claim that historically, carbon dioxide levels have been much lower, particularly around 500-600 million years ago[1]. But the carbon dioxide level is not the only factor that affect global temperature[2]. Additionally, this position fails to account for the differences in solar activity, that was drastically different from current levels. This position also fails to explain why a comprehensive analysis of carbon dioxide levels over the last 540 millions years concluded that 'Periods of low CO2 coincide with periods of geographically widespread ice.' This is clearly visible in this graph, where the shaded periods are periods of widespread ice.'[3]I shall also strengthen this argument and adapt it to Con's specific contention.Firstly Con cites data, which no longer exists. This is bad practice. He should seek alternative data that supports his contention that, even if one assumes the data is reliable, I have unequivocally refuted. Earth is cooling.This is patently not true and in most instances of my opponents argument, a bare assertion. In the others, he has cherry picked unsupported evidence. Of course the Earth has been hotter historically (due to solar activity), but this is irrelevant. In this debate we are referring to Global Warming, which is the consistent rise in temperature since the 20th century up till this point, which is clearly occurring. This figure shows the change in the earth's total heat content since 1960[1]. This more advanced graph is the average of 5 different data sets, adjusted for the short-term effects of the El Nino Southern Oscillation, solar variability, and volcanic aerosols[2].Con then proceeds to [sic]site Don Easterbrook, who claims his model predicted the temperature more accurately than the IPCC. This is an outright falsehood. In fact, Easterbrook had to distort the IPCC projection figures to make his graph compelling. Here is the actual data[3]:We see that the IPCC's projections were much more accurate. Shall we zoom in a bit more?Con then cites his first actual study, despite it being relatively insignificant, as it is a single study and has a largely negligent effect on the hockey stick graph. I'm now going to provide some consistent and substantiated data regarding the hockey stick graph.The hockey stick is describes a sharp increase in temperature visible within a reconstruction of temperatures in the last 1000 years. The original paper describing this trend appeared in 1998,but since then there has been a number of notable proxy studies that have confirmed its findings[4][5][6]. In 2007 an independent study reconstructed largely similar results, and evaluated the statistical techniques employed to create it[7]: Con's own graph was constructed from unknown data sets, presumably by NewsBusters, a questionable source (given their clear bias in documenting the issue). His next graph is also cited the same source, despite that graph not existing anywhere on the source page. I have no obligation to rebut something that has been pulled from thin air and not substantiated with fact, especially in supposedly scientific debates like this one.In his next argument, pertaining to water vapour, Con shows elementary misunderstanding of climate sensitivity and feedback. His argument can be summed up in the following format:P1: Water vapor makes up 95% of greenhouse gases and CO2 only . (Bare assertion)P2: The climate sensitivity of water vapour is around 0.25%. The climate sensitivity of CO2 is around 1%. (Disputable and unsourced, my Constructive Case hinted at a slightly higher figure between 2 and 4.5 degrees)P3: Global warming is occurring. (A sudden change of heart)C1: Water vapour is responsible for global warming,Before I begin tearing this nonsense apart I'd like to urge voters to hold Con accountable for changing advocacy half way through his case (in the same contention!). He first contends that there is no warming, and then holds that there is warming, only that water vapour is responsible. We aren't going to have quality discourse if Con does not hold a stable position.Con fails to understand that weak warming caused by more carbon dioxide will lead to more water vapor in the atmosphere, which will then amplify the weak warming through water vapor’s role as the atmosphere’s primary greenhouse gas. Water vapour is responsible for much of the greenhouse effect, but only because warmer air masses, on average, contain more water vapor. In short, water vapour acts a feedback, not a forcing[10]. Much of his further case was also preemptively rebutted in my initial constructive case: 'Despite man made carbon dioxide emissions being comparatively smaller than natural emissions, the real driving force of climate change is the net quantity of carbon dioxide released, since most natural carbon emissions are absorbed[8]. Because of this, atmospheric carbon dioxide is at the highest levels in approximately 15 to 20 million years. R3:A single, self-described proponent of climate change being wrong, on a single instance, has no relevance to the ultimate scientific validity of climate change. This is hardly worth rebutting. Can we move discussion to the science, rather than people, and badly reported news stories?R4:Con argues that sea level rise has not occurred and cites Mörner, whose work has consistently been discredited by the organisations that he claims to represent:'Mörner claims that the 'true experts' think this data is wrong (emphasis added):  'The world’s true experts on sea level are to be found at the INQUA (International Union for Quaternary Research) commission on Sea Level Changes and Coastal Evolution (of which I am a former president), not at the IPCC. Our research is what the climate lobby might call an ‘inconvenient truth’: it shows that sea levels have been oscillating close to the present level for the last three centuries. This is not due to melting glaciers: sea levels are affected by a great many factors, such as the speed at which the earth rotates. They rose in the order of 10 to 11cm between 1850 and 1940, stopped rising or maybe even fell a little until 1970, and have remained roughly flat ever since.'  This is quite different from the INQUA official position on climate change, which opens by saying (emphasis added):  Climate change is realThere is now strong evidence that significant global warming is occurring. The evidence comes from direct measurements of rising surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures and, indirectly, from increases in average global sea levels, retreating glaciers, and changes in many physical and biological systems. It is very likely that most of the observed increase in global temperatures since the mid-twentieth century is due to human-induced increases in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere (IPCC 2007).' [1]  Unfortunately ounces up and down slightly from year to year so it's possible to cherry-pick data falsely suggesting the overall trend is flat, falling or linear. Credible sources will all display sea level averages over the long term. Here is a study done by the University of Colorado [2]: It shows a clear trend in sea level movement since 1995. Another study, analysing global mean sea level from 1870 through 2006 determined another clear trend. R5: Con has not provided a single relevant source, which, quite frankly, in an entirely statistical and scientific argument, is unacceptable. I cannot rebut imaginary data. Next round, please provide valid sources and explain their relevance, and I will take delight in rebutting them,ConclusionMuch of Con's argument has been founded on bare assertions and comprehensive misinterpretations of climate science. I have rebutted all his sourced claims, and hopefully cleared up much of his misunderstanding in regard to climate feedback.Onto the next round. Good luck, Con.</t>

    <t>Contention 1: No Major/any CO2 Increase.      Many Global Warming advocates state that CO2 levels are skyrocketing, but that is incorrect. I give you the above graph measuring the past 600 million years of CO2 levels are we are actually at an all time low. Now the website I got this from no longer has this page up so I appologize. We can see from observance of this graph that we being at all time CO2 low levles that we are nowhere close to meeting the impact that my opponent brings up. We have been over 5,000 ppm of CO2 in our atmosphere and are now currently around apprx. 350 ppm CO2 levels.  The above graph shows that comparisions of C13 (Carbon isotope) and this shows that there is little to no trend pertrade in many of these as the average is zero while the trend for all of these are zero. (1) This is important as the Carbon isotope is important in measuring this so called 'Global Warming.'  This chart above shows the CO2 and Earth's temperatures for the past 600 million years. My opponent's claims are incorect as we have had aburd levels of CO2 and temperature on Earth and may I ask how did we survive that? (2) Now I will move on to how Earth is actually cooling and how it's temperature is cooler than it has been. Contention 2: Earth is cooling.  If we observe the above graph we can see that Earth has been a whole lot hotter than where we currently are to the point where the Earth's average temperature has been 7.5 degrees Celcuis hotter than it currently it is. You can also see that in the span of the past 10,000 years the temperature has leveld off, but you may ask yourself where does that place us in the lights of modern day?  I am going to site Dr. Done Easterbrook, who is a climate scientist. Back in 2000 he predicted that Earth was entering a cooling phase. He predicts that for the next 20 years Earth will cool by 3/10 degree each year and that we are going to enter another little Ice Age like we did from 1650 and 1790. (3) The funny thing is that many of my opponent's charts are actually from the incorrect IPPC. How about the 'Hockey Stick' graph that many Global Warming supporters , including my opponent, argue about? Well if we observe the fallowing chart taken from Northern Scandenavia we can see that the Global trend over the past 1,000 years that the Global Cooling trend slope is that of -0.31 Degrees Celcuis, give or take 0.03 degrees (for the error room). Professor Dr. Jan Esper has found that the Earth's temperature of Earth actually decreases 0.3 per millenia due to the Earth moving away from the sun. (4)   Here is another graph from 1920 to 2005 and we can see that the graph has a negative temperature slope, thus meaning that the Earth is under a period of cooling. (5)  You can see in terms of more Warming in the evidence in which Scientists use Ice Cores Earth has actually been Cooling the past Mellenium.  Finailly, lets bring up just how much these accused compounds exactly warm the Earth's atmosphere. CO2 for example has the global warming potential of 1. Here are the other numbers. Carbon Dioxide -- 1Methane -- 21Nitrous Oxide -- 298-310CFC's -- VariousWater Vapor -- 0.25  Now I just want you to keep this in mind for this next part here. We may observe that humans release approximately 35 gigatons of CO2 a year. [14] This is only 4.3% of the total amount of all Global Warming Gasses, however it is incrediably small when it comes to comparing the rest of the Global Warming gasses. If we observe the chart bellow we can see that Water Vapor is a large Contributor to Global Warming at 95% and CO2 comes in second. But here's the kicker. If we look at the Human contributed part that I'm about to post in the graph bellow we can see that it's very miniscule of 0.117% of all total Warming gasses. Now let's do some quick math here. CO2's increase was from what my opponent is claiming is from 295 ppm to 400ppm, a total of only 105 ppm. 1 Gigaton of CO2 is the equilivent of 2.13 ppm. [15] This means that increase of 105 ppm means a total of 49.29 gigatons. Since 1 gigaton of CO2 is the equivilance of .004% of the Greenhouse effect that means that 49.29 gigatons means an aditional .21% increase to Global Warming. This would account for a grand total of a 0.15 F increase in global temperature. This is a very measly amount and we can see that with my opponent's claims a simple 0.15 F increase isn't enough to melt glacers and have the effeccts that he is speaking of and it proves that this is NAUTRAL not man-made to fulfil his effects if they were real. Now remind yourself that this debate is about humans creating a LARGE amount of Global Warming, not a miniscule amount. You can see that in terms of Gasses contribution to the Green House Effect the major contributer is Water Vapor and it's at 95% to CO2's 3.6% and this is the overall contribution including man made and natural. When we look to the chart on the left we can see that Man-Made CO2 does have a higher contribution to the atmosphere than Water Vapor, but that's because we do not create much water vapor as humans. Even with this evidence we can see that CO2 does not have any effect what-so-ever compared to Water Vapor. (6) Where might those CFCs be on this graph you may ask. Why it's under the Misc. gases section. Contention 3: Artic Ice. Al Gore stated that the Artic Ice would be completely melted by 2014, but he is incorrect then and now.  Jan. 6, 2012: The Coast Guard Cutter Healy breaks ice around the Russian-flagged tanker Renda 250 miles south of Nome. The Healy is the Coast Guard’s only currently operating polar icebreaker. The vessels are transiting through ice up to five-feet thick in this area. The 370-foot tanker Renda will have to go through more than 300 miles of sea ice to get to Nome, a city of about 3,500 people on the western Alaska coastline that did not get its last pre-winter fuel delivery because of a massive storm. (7) Let's go back to 2007-2008 and see if his claim was justified in the Artic Ice activity.  Hmmm... It seems that he is incorrect, but let's look further into the near past. How about 2012-2013? (8) We all remember the Climate Scientists that got stuck in Arctic Ice Earlier last year correct? Then a Russian Ice Breaker tried to free them, but got stuck. Can you guess what they were studying? They had predicted that all the Arctic Ice had melted due to Global Warming and that Earth would get flooded massively. Boy were they wrong. (9)  (10)  Dr. Koonin, former head of the Department of Energy under President Obama, has stated that the Global Warming scare is not suttle. This is because that he has found 3 things wrong and highly incorrect about the scare. 1. Shrinking of Artic Sea ice doesn't acount for the gaining of the Antartic ice. 2. The warming of Earth's temps today is the same as it was 30 years ago. 3. The sea levels rose at the same height and rate in the 20th cenury. (11)  Contention 4: Sea Levels Here is another corralation that must happen. If the Ice Caps are completely melted as many GW advocates claim then the sea level would have risen completely drowning tons of land.  The graph above is raw satellite image data of the sea level rise over an 8 year period showing that there is little to no change in the Sea Levels rising. (12) The sea level rises, on average, about 3 inches per century and it has been found to not even been rising at all.  This graph is the sea levels off the cost of French Guyana which is one of the areas which is predicted to be flooded due to Global Warming, but as you can see by the graph (which goes to 2008) the sea level is currently on a downward trend. (13) The source is the PDF within the link.Contention 5: The WeatherMany Global Warming Advocates claim that Hurricanes are increasing due to Global Warming, but this claim is indeed false! The hurricanes since the year 1900 to 2008 have actually been decreasing. The slope of this downward slope is .0016. Though it is small the hurricanes are still in a downward trend.As a matter of fact not only are Hurricanes on a downward trend, but they are at an all time low as in the year 2010, there was only 68 Hurricanes Globally, which is an all time low in the past 40 years. How about Tornados you may ask?In the graph above you can see that tornados are at an all time low in the past 60 years! (14) But what about Hurricanes?Here is a graph showing the number of days between hurricanes and this shows that the number of days between hurricanes is greatest at 76 days between hurricanes.The slope of this line is zero showing no trend of a massive storm increase. </t>

    <t>Contention 1: No major/any CO2 IncreaseFirstly I would like to point out a huge drop from my last round. This was my just how much of each of the Green House Gasses actually contribute and how much of them actually are from man made. Let's run those percentages one more time. Water Vapor---0.001%CO2---0.117%Methane---0.066%N2O---0.047%Misc. (including CFCs)---0.047%We can see here that these percentages are indeed quite low and this was dropped by my opponent so I extend them across the board.     Let us observe the above graph. Here I would like to point out the that the increase from Pre-Inustrial to Industrial era and the doubling of the CO2 leveling lead to a decrease in it's temperature. Also we can see that the 10 mile 'hot-spot' above the tropics is actually absent. 'The computer models show that greenhouse warming will cause a hot-spot at an altitude between 8 and 12 km over the tropics between 30 N and 30 S. The temperature at this hot-spot is projected to increase at a rate of two to three times faster than at the surface. However, the Hadley Centre's real-world plot of radiosonde temperature observations shown below does not show the projected CO2 induced global warming hot-spot at all. The predicted hot-spot is entirely absent from the observational record. This shows that atmosphere warming theory programmed into climate models are wrong.' [1]If we observe the above Greenland Ice Core we can see that though it's been heating up we can swee that on average it's a whole lot colder than what it is on a normal basis. This is also acknowledging that humans have only been around in the past 10,000 years or so we can see that this Ice Core is still colder than normal even with the emmission that are produced today. Now if we observe the above graph of the past 400,000 yeasrs we can see that the CO2 rates in our atmosphere has flutated the exact same way in this cycle both before and during the existance of human beings. We can see that the temperatures and CO2 levels have been going up and down randomly for the past 100 thousands years and it is observed that this occured before the industrial revolution. We can also see that right now we are in a warming period so that arguing that humans are because of this is post hoc. Not to mention that we are in the coldest of the warming periods in Earth's history! Hence this reveals that this whole Global Warming is just a cycle that Earth is expierencing. We can see that once again despite contrary to belief we can see that though there may be warming the fact is simply that there is no human warming.I also appologize for using evidence that has expired. Could you tell me which one and I'll post it in the comments section. Thanks. Contention 2: Earth is Cooling  You're probably asking yourself, why am I seeing this graph again? This is because the more CO2 we get the less warming there is. If we observe this graph we can see that the Warming has decreased with more CO2 that we've recieved. This shows that CO2 doesn't have that much of an impact on the tempterature like the math that I've proved it in my last contention. [2]  Now I will agree that Eastbrook isn't good with predicting temperature change, but the IPCC is even worse, but whatever is causing the change it is highly unlikely that it's man made. Once again we can see that the IPCC and Al Gore are inccorect as the hocky stick graph is a bust. As I've shown in earlier rounds and they have been dropped in showing that the Earth's temperature has indeed been way hotter then current and on an average basis at that. My opponent has also dropped my opening graph in C1 r2 That also showed that CO2 levels are at an all time low! Thus once again disproving my opponent's theory.Here we can see that even though CO2 levels are increaseing that the temperature in recent years has actually decreased on the linear scale. Also the US Senate Committe on Envirnment and public works also took a stab at this issue. They found that the Hocky Stick graph was also bogus in 2006. “Today’s NAS report reaffirms what I have been saying all along, that Mann's ‘hockey stick’ is broken,”Senator Inhofe said.“Today’s report refutes Mann's prior assertions that there was no Medieval Warm Period or Little Ice Age.” “This report shows that the planet warmed for about 200 years prior to the industrial age, when we were coming out of the depths of the Little Ice Age where harsh winters froze the Thames and caused untold deaths. “Trying to prove man-made global warming by comparing the well-known fact that today's temperatures are warmer than during the Little Ice Age is akin to comparing summer to winter to show a catastrophic temperature trend.” [3]Here we can see that they've found that this warming of the similiar to what my opponent is trying to prove is actually indeed bogus. Paleoclimate scientist Bob Carter had shown through his research at University of East Angila in the United Kingdom that the Climate Change increase had actually froze from 1998-2006 showing that this so called Global Warming had actually stopped. [4]  My opponent tries to claim that I am a hypocrate, but he is yet twisting my own words. I'm showing that there's none if not barely little warming and that Water Vapor is a key part of it. He fails to see that I showed that how much water vapor is when I showed the equation in my last round in Contention 1, so my opponent's tangent is irrelivant here. Contention 3: Artic Ice and Sea Level.I do appologize. Let me bring up other evidence since my last round apparently wasn't good enough though I sited NASA of all organizations.   THough my opponent likes to blow things out of perportion we can see that these sea levels rise and fall on their own. It's a natural cycle as I showed last round. The trend shows only a mere +/- 0.30 mm per year. 'The Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory estimates the rate of sea level rise at 1.42 plus or minus 0.14 mm/year for the period 1954 to 2003. This is less than the estimate of 1.91 plus or minus 0.14 mm/year for the period 1902 to 1953, indicating a slowing of the rate.' [5] We can see that 2.8 inches per 50 years isn't that much of an appocolyptic threat.  Here is a graph from NOAA which shows that the sea level rise is very small and that the IPCC is way off as well as many other Warming 'experts'. [6]  In the above graph we can see that despit Artic Ice slightly decreasing we can see that it follows the same patern throughout the year as the Ice melts in the summer and freezes in the winter. We can see that my opponents' sea ice level predictions are incorrect. [7] Which if sea ice is decreasing then explain the great sea ice exspansion of Antartica in 2012 shown bellow. It had a total of 20,000 miles more ice than average.  The graph bellow is proof of the cycle of what I'm talking about. Plus even if it was caused by Global Warming my opponent still has to prove that it was caused by HUMANS in order to take the win here not to show that it exists.According studies done by Ola Johannessen we can see that the Greenland Ice Sheet is growing! Also we can see from the same study is that the Artic was actually warmer in the 1930's than today! [8]I also extend across all of my previous arguments for this Contention.Contention 4: Storms  The NOAA has shown that Tornados are less frequent and occur less and less.  [9] I continue to extend across my NOAA Hurricane graph from last round.If we observe the above graph we can see that there is no net increase in violent Hurricanes nor their wind speed. We can see that my includes more years and hence more data which disproves my opponents. Plus when you add in my R2 graph, which was unrefuted, you can see that there is zero if not a decreasing trend when it comes to hurricanes. My graphs are just some imaginary data and I shall extend them all across the board. </t>

    <t>In this debate I'm going to be arguing that Global Warming is anthropogenic.C1: Carbon dioxide causes warmingCarbon dioxide has been identified as having 'greenhouse' qualities for over a century[1]. The greenhouse effect occurs when GHGs allow shortwave solar radiation to pass through the atmosphere. This energy is absorbed of the earth, and then radiates this heat as infrared radiation. This is usually referred to as outgoing longwave radiation. This theory is particularly well-explained in this diagram.This means that a with more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, we should observe lower levels of this longwave radiation escaping into space the the wavelengths carbon dioxide is meant to absorb. This was recorded by the IRIS satellite and later confirmed by the IMG satellite over a 26 year period. The paper concluded that the experiment could be considered 'direct experimental evidence for a significant increase in the Earth's greenhouse effect'[2]. This same experiment has been adapted multiple times in order to measure downward longwave radiation from the ground[3][4]. This empirical evidence is unequivocal.Another way line of empirical reasoning that supports carbon dioxide's effect on the climate is through historic instances of climate change. This paper quantified the equilibrium temperature change in response to radiative forcing change, climate sensitivity, of the pre-anthropogenic eras[5]. The results of this analysis, were consistent with IPCC estimates. A 2 and 4.5°C global surface warming in response to doubled carbon dioxide.Just to really nail the coffin, I'll raise one further argument that determines a net positive feedback, in regard to climate sensitivity: modelling estimates. These work by calculating numerical data and predictions based on the physical, chemical and biological properties of its components, their interactions and feedback processes, and accounting for all or some of its known properties. A notable 2002 paper used a fingerprinting approach on modern temperature records and found a range of approximately 1.4 to 7.7°C [6]. A later model looked at paleontological data over the past 6 centuries to calculates a range 1.5 to 6.2°C [7]. This position is quite literally a platitude in any climate researchers books, since it is so well supported. This will be evident within my scientific consensus contention. C2: Humans are the source of the vast majority of resultant carbon dioxideThis figure shows the estimated balance of carbon dioxide emissions.Despite man made carbon dioxide emissions being comparatively smaller than natural emissions, the real driving force of climate change is the net quantity of carbon dioxide released, since most natural carbon emissions are absorbed[1]. Because of this, atmospheric carbon dioxide is at the highest levels in approximately 15 to 20 million years[2]. Many skeptics claim that historically, carbon dioxide levels have been much lower, particularly around 500-600 million years ago[3]. But the carbon dioxide level is not the only factor that affect global temperature[4]. Additionally, this position fails to account for the differences in solar activity, that was drastically different from current levels. This position also fails to explain why a comprehensive analysis of carbon dioxide levels over the last 540 millions years concluded that 'Periods of low CO2 coincide with periods of geographically widespread ice.' This is clearly visible in this graph, where the shaded periods are periods of widespread ice.Many prominent climate science papers have argued that, if it were not for Natural contributions cooling the climate, we would be, in fact, a little hotter.Net human and natural percent contributions to the observed global surface warming over the past 50-65 years. There is a widespread, comprehensive scientific consensusThe contentions I have argued are not unfounded, flawed or bogus. In fact, they are so convincing that there exists a well-established scientific consensus.A recent survey of 12,000 climate science papers that expressed a position on the cause of global warming found that 97% of them agreed that anthropogenic global warming is occurring[1].The same survey found a historic strengthening of the Pro-AGW consensus since 1990.Another survey of 908 randomly selected climate scientists with more than 20 peer-reviewed publications settled upon a similar figure: '≈97% of self-identified actively publishing climate scientists agree with the tenets of anthropogenic climate change'[2]. My opponent might argue that the majority of papers expressed no position, therefore leaving room for a much weaker scientific consensus. This would fail to account, however, for the fact that the vast majority of papers included had already accepted AGW as a premise. Oreskes predicts this result, arguing that, 'Scientists generally focus their discussions on questions that are still disputed or unanswered rather than on matters about which everyone agrees'. ConclusionI have shown that the climate is sensitive to increased levels of carbon dioxide, and that humans are the source of it. These positions are so well supported that an establish scientific consensus exists.Over to you, Con!</t>

    <t>GHG Ratios: This was not a huge drop. I had previously explained that that 'weak warming caused by more carbon dioxide will lead to more water vapor in the atmosphere, which will then amplify the weak warming through water vapor’s role as the atmosphere’s primary greenhouse gas. Water vapour is responsible for much of the greenhouse effect, but only because warmer air masses, on average, contain more water vapor. In short, water vapour acts a feedback, not a forcing[1]' The quantities are irrelevant of water vapour are irrelevant when my contention regarding climate sensitivity remains unchallenged. Climate sensitivity is the crux of this debate, and if my opponent cannot refute my claims, he has essentially lost.Industrial CO2 Doubling: This next contention is unfounded and a bare assertion, so I'm not going to waste character space rebutting it.Tropospheric Hot Spots: Con then claims that AGW models are invalidated by the lack of a tropospheric hot spot. There is a tropospheric hot spot. [2][3][4] Yet even if there were not, it would not disprove AGW because tropospheric occur regardless of heat source, as they are caused by lapse rates. [5] I.E. If the warming was caused by a brightening sun or reduced sulphate pollution, you'd still see a hot spot. All that the IPCC temperature signature in your source predicted was a greater forcing of temperature.Ice Core Cooling: Once again an unfounded and bare assertion, without any statistical backing. I've shown in my previous contentions that warming is undoubtedly occurring, and those contentions have been dropped.Historic CO2 Fluctuations: It's upsetting that you don't cite any sources, because this could be a good argument. R2: None of this is especially relevant, Con is arguing about how good the IPCC are at forecasting temperature and long term climate sensitivity. I have proven that warming is occurring, and Con has not even touched by arguments. Con concedes Easterbrook was falsified, but then goes on to claim CO2 is at an all time low. As I've previously mentioned: 'Because of this, atmospheric carbon dioxide is at the highest levels in approximately 15 to 20 million years[1]. Many skeptics claim that historically, carbon dioxide levels have been much lower, particularly around 500-600 million years ago[2]. But the carbon dioxide level is not the only factor that affect global temperature[3]. Additionally, this position fails to account for the differences in solar activity, that was drastically different from current levels. This position also fails to explain why a comprehensive analysis of carbon dioxide levels over the last 540 millions years concluded that 'Periods of low CO2 coincide with periods of geographically widespread ice.' This is clearly visible in this graph, where the shaded periods are periods of widespread ice.'Because of this, atmospheric carbon dioxide is at the highest levels in approximately 15 to 20 million years[2]. Many skeptics claim that historically, carbon dioxide levels have been much lower, particularly around 500-600 million years ago[3]. But the carbon dioxide level is not the only factor that affect global temperature[4]. Additionally, this position fails to account for the differences in solar activity, that was drastically different from current levels. This position also fails to explain why a comprehensive analysis of carbon dioxide levels over the last 540 millions years concluded that 'Periods of low CO2 coincide with periods of geographically widespread ice.' This is clearly visible in this graph, where the shaded periods are periods of widespread ice.[1] R3:Arctic Ice: Arctic ice has increased but this is down to ozone levels over Antarctica having dropped causing stratospheric cooling and increasing winds which lead to more areas of open water that can be frozen[1].Sea Level: Con essentially ignores all my substantial evidence of record mean global sea levels, and just repeats his old statistics, and after that concedes sea levels are rising, but once again states without any modicum of objectivity, that the evil IPCC were off. This is not relevant. You have conceded my rebuttals - sea levels are rising. R4:The general consensus on this topic is inconclusive. I really don't see it's relevance. To win this debate, Con should have refuted my claims about and climate sensitivity, that is the crux of debate, and he has failed to do so. Con has consistently struggle to provide coherent positions and reliable evidence throughout the debate. Ultimately, the science is conclusive and much of my initial contentions have been dropped.Vote Pro!</t>

<h>Now, back onto the debate.____________________________________________________________________________________Thank you, lannan13, for that impressive response. Unfortunately, he has broken the rules by refuting my graphs and data I had put out in round 2:'Round 2: Opening arguments and Constructive Case, NO REBUTTALS' I'm not sure if I should let it slide since this seems like my most fun debate, so that will be up to my opponent. I will first focus on rebuttals, then my contentions. Note that counter-rebuttals are now switched to this round as my opponent refuted my graphs in round 2, thus I must respond to these refutations or otherwise they will be seen as dropped.==Rebuttal 1: No Major/any Co2 increase==My opponent's graph is a graph of Co2 levels over the past 600 million years. In contrast, my graph is a graph on Co2 levels only throughout the past 650,000 years. My opponent's graph shows as time closes in on the present, the Co2 levels grow lower. However that is because we are looking at a much broader timeline and thus can't see all the needed details in the graph. Yes, we are at an all time low, but that doesn't mean Co2 levels aren't increasing [1]:  I would like to point out that global warming doesn't mandate warming all throughout Earth's life. Global Warming happens anytime when Earth's temperature substantially increases, and that is what is happening. If Co2 levels are increasing, mainly due to human activity, and Earth's temperature rises at the same rate at the same time, then we already have good evidence man-made global warming exists.Also, it seems that my opponent uses a graph by Robert Berner. It is known that Berner's studies are very untrustworthy, especially this one. You can see in the following graph that his graph contains many errors [2]:'History of Atmospheric CO2 through geological time (past 550 million years: from Berner, Science,1997)... The shaded area encloses the approximate range of error of the modeling based on sensitivity analysis...' [2]My opponent then goes on to state that man-made global warming (or even global warming on general) does not exist simply because our Earth has been much hotter before, and then asks, 'may I ask how did we survive that?' However this is a fallacy because:1.) I had already stated that global warming does not mandate a warming all throughout Earth's life, and recently it has been increasing, even though if not by as much as older times. Also, under the circumstances, one degree is still quite substantial.2.) We could not survive in those times as the human race had not even come to being, let alone the dinosaur race. Plus, the animals and forms of life during those times were specially adapted to the hot climate. Also, this is irrelevant as we are only debating the existence of man-made global warming, not if we are going to survive it.3.) Because of the sun being dimmer than now, higher Co2 levels would be needed in order to keep the Earth at a bearable temperature, or else the Earth would literally freeze over. This contention is negated.==Rebuttal 2: The Earth is Actually Cooling==Again, I must remind my opponent that global warming does not mandate warming throughout Earth's life. As you can see at the end of the graph, the temperature slightly increases back, thus proving global warming's existence, and, with the previous information I had given, man-made global warming as well. Just because the Earth has been hotter before doesn't mean it isn't warming again.When my opponent puts up his graph on the cooling of early 2000, again this is misleading, and Easterbrook's predictions have gone wrong from the first 10 years of data collected on the graph. Yet my opponent claims the IPCC studies are incorrect, which is untrue. The evidence is here [3]:    “Figure 5: Don Easterbrook's global temperature graphic presented during the 2010 Heartland conference.” Then, down lower on the cited website [3], it is said:  “So while the IPCC TAR projection was too high by about 0.12°C for the reasons discussed above [on cited website], Easterbrook's projections were too low by 0.28°C and 0.58°C. Despite all of these non-greenhouse gas factors acting in the cooling direction over this timeframe, the IPCC projection was still much closer to reality than Easterbrook's.” [3] On my opponent’s next graph, he shows that each millennium the Earth cools down by 0.3 degrees Celsius (0.54 degrees Fahrenheit) due to Earth’s motion away from the Sun. However, the study was conducted only for the last 2 millennia, when most of the millennia were basically Industrial Revolution and modern activity free. The IR started in 1790 [4]. At the end of the graph, the global temperature abruptly rises above the red line even before 2000, thus proving the existence of global warming, and man-made global warming. This is the same for my opponent’s next two graphs. My opponent’s last graph focuses on the contribution of the Greenhouse gases, and states that the contributions are very low. However that does not negate the existence of global warming or man-made global warming, it simply states that global warming is slow and weak. Thus, this contention is negated. ==Rebuttal 3: Arctic Ice and Sea levels== “First, I would like to state that Pro’s claim about the North Pole completely melting is bogus.” Never in this debate did I ever claim that. This is a straw-man. In my opponent’s Arctic Ice graphs, he shows that since nothing has happened to the Arctic Ice Sheet, global warming, and thus man-made global warming, cannot exist. However, again this is a straw-man since he simply takes a single photo for each year (which only shows the ice on a specific date) and then compares them. It is literally subjective to choose the worst of something on an earlier date and compare it with the best of something on a later specific date. For example, you could say that Whitney Houston is bad because she had an off-day, which is completely untrue. Also, although I don’t believe in all Arctic Ice melting, it is melting slowly and gradually [5]:  And here is a graph on gradually rising sea levels, contradicting my opponent’s [6]:    Thus this contention is negated and proved once again man-made global warming exists. ==Rebuttal 4: The Weather== “My opponent is claiming that Hurricanes are increasing due to Global Warming, but this claim is indeed false!” Again, never in the debate have I claimed that. What’s more, hurricanes aren’t actually linked to global warming in general [7]! “Hurricanes aren't linked to global warming “According to the National Hurricane Center, storms are no more intense or frequent worldwide than they have been since 1850. […] Constant 24-7 media coverage of every significant storm worldwide just makes it seem that way.” (Paul Bedard)” [7] The story is similar for tornadoes as well [8]: “Global warming may well end up making them more frequent or intense, as our intuition would tell us. But it might also actually suppress them—the science just isn't clear yet.” [8] Thus, either way, this contention doesn’t contradict anything about the existence of man-made global warming. ==Contention 3: Oceanic Acidification== A large portion of the Co2 emitted by the atmosphere is absorbed into the ocean. The more Co2 that is emitted into the atmosphere, the more is absorbed into the ocean, and thus the more acidified the ocean becomes [9]. This and warmer temperatures generally cause coral bleaching, which has happened more frequently recently due to its relatively narrow habitable temperature range [10].    Ocean acidification has increased by 30% since the Industrial Revolution [11]. This acidification can harm aquatic organisms, of which organisms that do not need oxygen take place and release greenhouse gases like methane, [12] thus proving that man-made global warming exists. ==Conclusion== I have refuted all my opponent’s arguments and have given out major information to support the existence of man-made global warming. Thus, the resolution stands affirmed.</h>

    <t>If this doesn't work, click on the original link and take off the extra space at the end of the link in the URL bar. I actually quoted the wrong part of this website by mistake. I was meant to quote 'It is unclear whether global warming is increasing hurricane frequency but there is increasing evidence that warming increases hurricane intensity.'Also, apologies for writing Carbon Dioxide as Co2 (Cobalt2, as my adversary points out). It's just the way I grew up writing it.Moving on, Counter 1: Co2 and its effects=='Now remind yourself that Pro said in Round 2 that CO2 is responsable for LARGE amount of Global Warming.' - OpponentI'm not sure where I said this. I ask my adversary to quote from me.In fact, my opponent's entire rebuttal for this argument is misleading. It is subjective to use only Co2 as a base for a rebuttal against the resolution. If we were to count all the other causes of the greenhouse effect, then it is very possible to conclude that this can heat Earth by more than just 0.15 degrees Fahrenheit. My opponent even concedes that there is a warming caused by anthropogenic emissions, but then states that it is very low. That isn't what his BoP wants. To fulfill it, he must disprove the entirety of anthropogenic global warming.'Since 1 gigaton of CO2 is the equivilance of .004% of the Greenhouse effect that means that 49.29 gigatons means an aditional .21% increase to Global Warming. This would account for a grand total of a 0.15 F increase in global temperature.' - OpponentNot only have Co2 levels increased, but there are steep increases in other greenhouse gases as well [1]:Be reminded that there is already a correlation between Earth's temperature and Co2 levels, and that the rates of circular cooling and warming, and increase/decrease of Co2 levels have stopped and started to rise severely [2]:We cannot use my opponent's graph which suggests the contrary to the temperatures above, as it only uses data from Georgia [3], a state in the United States of America [4]. There is literally a direct contradiction between my adversary's chart (from 1990, Georgia) and mine (1880, worldwide).Atmospheric concentrations of Co2 and anthropogenic emissions of Co2 have a correlation as well [5]: My opponent then goes on to review a graph on the logarithmic effects of increased carbon dioxide levels. Even if this is true, by my opponent's logic there is still a warming effect. It just gets smaller, but not negative. We can't say that the warming effect is slower to disprove the entirety of anthropogenic global warming, because that is fallacious and invalid, and ends up failing to fulfill the real BoP here.==Counter 2: The earth is actually cooling==People and websites have actually shown the hot-spot absence to be fake. According to Skeptical Science, the absence of the hot-spot could be due to the errors in the processing of data [6]:'Satellite measurements match model results apart from in the tropics. There is uncertainty with the tropic data due to how various teams correct for satellite drift. The U.S. Climate Change Science Program conclude the discrepancy is most likely due to data errors.' - Skeptical Science [6]'Allen and Sherwood sought to side step the problems associated with the radiosonde data entirely, and examined the “dynamical relationship known as the thermal-wind equation, which relates horizontal temperature gradients to wind shear”. Thermal wind speed data, in contrast to the temperature data, lacked many of the systematic adjustment issues and other errors, and were used as a proxy for temperature. Allen and Sherwood found that the troposphere appeared to be warming in reasonable agreement to theoretical and modeling expectations.' - Skeptical Science [6]The IPCC projections are actually considered to be quite accurate, in comparison to both of Easterbrook's projections [7] (animation of both comparisons, then together):'All of the IPCC projections have proven to be quite accurate, suggesting high reliability.  The contrarian projections all underestimate the global warming substantially, and in fact they erroneously predict global cooling and are quite unreliable.' - Skeptical Science [7]==Counter 3: Arctic Ice and Sea Levels==Note that the rise and fall of the data represents sea level CHANGE RATES, not the sea level itself. The majority of the data is above zero, meaning that on average the sea level, even if minimally, is rising.In fact, the sea level rise is actually accelerating quite quickly [8]:'A variety of different measurements find steadily rising sea levels over the past century.' - Skeptical Science [8]'The trend shows only a mere +/- 0.30 mm per year. 'The Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory estimates the rate of sea level rise at 1.42 plus or minus 0.14 mm/year for the period 1954 to 2003. This is less than the estimate of 1.91 plus or minus 0.14 mm/year for the period 1902 to 1953, indicating a slowing of the rate.' [6] We can see that 2.8 inches per 50 years isn't that much of an appocolyptic threat.' - OpponentThis is irrelevant. We are debating whether anthropogenic global warming exists, not if it is dangerous or not. The existence of something  does not mandate an argument of how safe it is.My opponent actually concedes that there is a rise, but again tries to save his stance on the argument by saying that it is minimal, which again isn't the point. By my opponent's logic, if man-made global warming exists, sea levels should not rise at all, to which he has conceded the contrary. Thus my opponent concedes this entire point.Also, although Arctic sea ice extent does follow a pattern, it is still gradually decreasing [9]: Although I will concede the Antarctic ice is expanding, the arctic is losing ice more than twice as fast than the Antarctic is gaining ice [10][11].'Since the late 1970s, the Arctic has lost an average of 20,800 square miles (53,900 square kilometers) of ice a year; the Antarctic has gained an average of 7,300 square miles (18,900 sq km).' - NASA [10]==Counter 4: Hurricanes and Tornadoes==I had already proven that tornadoes are not linked to global warming whatsoever, so this argument has been debunked. The hurricane argument has been re-responded to.To reinforce the fact that hurricanes are getting more intense however, here is a graph showing the increase of more intense hurricanes over time [12]:'Higher surface temperatures of the world's oceans could be responsible for the big rise in the strength of hurricanes, say US scientists.' - Physicsworld.com [12]==Counter 5: Ocean Acidification==Although it is correct that ocean acidification is not yet at a critical level, it is acidifying very rapidly. It is predicted that by 2100 the ocean will have a pH as low as 7.8 [13]:'Currently, there are no known natural explanations for the observed decline in GLOBAL AVERAGE ocean pH, and, there is one, clear human-caused explanation (note the global bit is important - there is natural local variation in pH but we are concerned with global shifts).' - Switchboard [13]Since the ocean is acidifying, the organisms in the ocean will slowly die out, for anaerobic organisms to replace them and emit gases such as methane, as shown in the last round.==Conclusion==I have effectively refuted all my opponent's claims and have shown how my opponent has essentially conceded. Thus the resolution is affirmed.</t>

    <t>Okay thanks, it works now. That's okay, but scientifically the O has to be capitalized, because if you don't it's Cobalt2. Hence Cobalt is Co and Carbon Dioxide is CO2, so please remember to wirte it correct, thanks!Contention 1: CO2 and its effects. I deeply appologize for mistaking for what my opponent had stated as it came from my opponent's 7th source in his second round, but let's move on.The fact is that the Warming from it's effects are so microscopic that it does not cause the effects that my opponent has brought up and to mention that he has DROPPED this portion stating how much Warming Gasses come from humans and it's very microscopic.  I'll be posting that graph bellow.  Now once again if we look at this chart we can see that the gasses that are these Warming gasses and compare it to how much mankind has contributed to the Warming equation we can see that it is very microscopic at best and has no impact upon the globe as it is just so small and microscopic. This is an important point that my opponent dropped as it shows that humans are not contributing to Global Warming, but rather something else is. Prehaps is the cows who's manuer produces more methane now for some strange reason? Just in case the graph doesn't post I'll post it's information bellow. GAS -- GREENHOUSE EFFECT -- HUMAN EFFECTWater Vapor ------ 95.000% -- 0.001%Carbon Dioxide -- 3.618% ---- 0.117%Methane ----------- 0.360 ------ 0.066%Nitrous oxide ------ 0.950% ---- 0.047% Misc 0.072% ---- 0.047%Total 100% ------- 0.278%  [1]Remeber the Warming numbers that I have posted last round that CO2 is the equilivence to 1 GWP. We can also see that my Numbers that I've allowed for my calculations were more moddested as it showed more of an increase than my opponent is showing and that was from one of his earlier graphs. Once again it's a 0.15 F increase of temperature and that's assuming there's a 105 ppm increase compared to the mere 40 ppm increase that my opponent has shown which means that the temperature under these numbers would drop to around 0.06 F. Again there isn't a large enough amount of emmitions produced from humans to cause a great difference in a global meltdown that my opponent is predictings. If we observe the above Greenland Ice Core we can see that though it's been heating up we can swee that on average it's a whole lot colder than what it is on a normal basis. This is also acknowledging that humans have only been around in the past 10,000 years or so we can see that this Ice Core is still colder than normal even with the emmission that are produced today. Now if we observe the above graph of the past 400,000 yeasrs we can see that the CO2 rates in our atmosphere has flutated the exact same way in this cycle both before and during the existance of human beings. We can see that the temperatures and CO2 levels have been going up and down randomly for the past 100 thousands years and it is observed that this occured before the industrial revolution. We can also see that right now we are in a warming period so that arguing that humans are because of this is post hoc. Not to mention that we are in the coldest of the warming periods in Earth's history! We can see that once again despite contrary to belief we can see that though there may be warming the fact is simply that there is no human warming.What I'm showing on my logerithum is that there is no corrilation to what my opponent is stating and this shows that more CO2 doesn't harm the atmosphere and destroy it like that of what my opponent is stating. Contention 2: Earth is cooling.My opponent drops the hot spot argument so we'll move on to the next argument. Once again we can see that the IPCC and Al Gore are inccorect as the hocky stick graph is a bust. As I've shown in earlier rounds and they have been dropped in showing that the Earth's temperature has indeed been way hotter then current and on an average basis at that. My opponent has also dropped my opening graph in C1 r2 That also showed that CO2 levels are at an all time low! Thus once again disproving my opponent's theory.Here we can see that even though CO2 levels are increaseing that the temperature in recent years has actually decreased on the linear scale. Also the US Senate Committe on Envirnment and public works also took a stab at this issue. They found that the Hocky Stick graph was also bogus in 2006. “Today’s NAS report reaffirms what I have been saying all along, that Mann's ‘hockey stick’ is broken,”Senator Inhofe said. “Today’s report refutes Mann's prior assertions that there was no Medieval Warm Period or Little Ice Age.” “This report shows that the planet warmed for about 200 years prior to the industrial age, when we were coming out of the depths of the Little Ice Age where harsh winters froze the Thames and caused untold deaths. “Trying to prove man-made global warming by comparing the well-known fact that today's temperatures are warmer than during the Little Ice Age is akin to comparing summer to winter to show a catastrophic temperature trend.” [2]Here we can see that they've found that this warming of the similiar to what my opponent is trying to prove is indeed bogus. Paleoclimate scientist Bob Carter had shown through his research at University of East Angila in the United Kingdom that the Climate Change increase had actually froze from 1998-2006 showing that this so called Global Warming had actually stopped. [3]  Contention 3: Artic Ice and Sea Levels.I do not concede the arugment as it shows that there is a plus or minus .3 mm increase or decrease each year which as I've shown in previous graphs in previous rounds that it's a cycle. The graph bellow is proof of the cycle of what I'm talking about. Plus even if it was caused by Global Warming my opponent still has to prove that it was caused by HUMANS in order to take the win here not to show that it exists.According studies done by Ola Johannessen we can see that the Greenland Ice Sheet is growing! Also we can see from the same study is that the Artic was actually warmer in the 1930's than today! [4]s://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com...; alt='' /gt;Here we can see that the Antartic Ice has been increasing recently, but you may ask what about the Artic Lannan? Well let's look.s://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com...; alt='' /gt;Well I'll be, not only is the artic ice growing, but it's getting thicker and thicker. According to studies we can see that if we tack on one more year to my opponent's graph we can see that he fails to tell you that from August 2012 to August 2013 that the Artic Ice grew 533,000 square miles and this is according to NASA charts.Contention 4: Hurricane and TornadosIf we observe the above graph we can see that there is no net increase in violent Hurricanes nor their wind speed. We can see that my includes more years and hence more data which disproves my opponents. Plus when you add in my R2 graph, which was unrefuted, you can see that there is zero if not a decreasing trend when it comes to hurricanes.Contention 5: Ocean AcidificationClimatoligist Rodger Pielke sr. has found that in the past when the Ocean has gained heat the Ocean has lost that heat within 2 years of which it was gained. Who has been quoted saying, 'certainly indicates that the multi-decadal global climate models have serious issues with their ability to accurately simulate the response of the climate system to human- and natural-climate forcings.' [5] This shows that the Ocean cannot be gaining this gaining an over exaggerated amount of CO2 causing the acidification that my opponent has been claiming. We can actually see that my opponent's graph actually fits within the amount of pH varriation that I have stated last round which further prooves my point. </t>

  <pair id="367" entailment="NONENTAILMENT" task="IE">
    <t>Contention 1: No Major/any CO2 Increase.      Many Global Warming advocates state that CO2 levels are skyrocketing, but that is incorrect. I give you the above graph measuring the past 600 million years of CO2 levels are we are actually at an all time low. Now the website I got this from no longer has this page up so I appologize. We can see from observance of this graph that we being at all time CO2 low levles that we are nowhere close to meeting the impact that my opponent brings up. We have been over 5,000 ppm of CO2 in our atmosphere and are now currently around apprx. 350 ppm CO2 levels.  The above graph shows that comparisions of C13 (Carbon isotope) and this shows that there is little to no trend pertrade in many of these as the average is zero while the trend for all of these are zero. (1) This is important as the Carbon isotope is important in measuring this so called 'Global Warming.'  This chart above shows the CO2 and Earth's temperatures for the past 600 million years. My opponent's claims are incorect as we have had aburd levels of CO2 and temperature on Earth and may I ask how did we survive that? (2) Now I will move on to how Earth is actually cooling and how it's temperature is cooler than it has been. Contention 2: Earth is cooling.  If we observe the above graph we can see that Earth has been a whole lot hotter than where we currently are to the point where the Earth's average temperature has been 7.5 degrees Celcuis hotter than it currently it is. You can also see that in the span of the past 10,000 years the temperature has leveld off, but you may ask yourself where does that place us in the lights of modern day?  I am going to site Dr. Done Easterbrook, who is a climate scientist. Back in 2000 he predicted that Earth was entering a cooling phase. He predicts that for the next 20 years Earth will cool by 3/10 degree each year and that we are going to enter another little Ice Age like we did from 1650 and 1790. (3) The funny thing is that many of my opponent's charts are actually from the incorrect IPPC. How about the 'Hockey Stick' graph that many Global Warming supporters , including my opponent, argue about? Well if we observe the fallowing chart taken from Northern Scandenavia we can see that the Global trend over the past 1,000 years that the Global Cooling trend slope is that of -0.31 Degrees Celcuis, give or take 0.03 degrees (for the error room). Professor Dr. Jan Esper has found that the Earth's temperature of Earth actually decreases 0.3 per millenia due to the Earth moving away from the sun. (4)   Here is another graph from 1920 to 2005 and we can see that the graph has a negative temperature slope, thus meaning that the Earth is under a period of cooling. (5)  You can see in terms of more Warming in the evidence in which Scientists use Ice Cores Earth has actually been Cooling the past Mellenium. You can see that in terms of Gasses contribution to the Green House Effect the major contributer is Water Vapor and it's at 95% to CO2's 3.6% and this is the overall contribution including man made and natural. When we look to the chart on the left we can see that Man-Made CO2 does have a higher contribution to the atmosphere than Water Vapor, but that's because we do not create much water vapor as humans. Even with this evidence we can see that CO2 does not have any effect what-so-ever compared to Water Vapor. (6) Where might those CFCs be on this graph you may ask. Why it's under the Misc. gases section. Contention 3: Artic Ice. First, I would like to state that Pro's claim about the North Pole completely melting is bogus. Al Gore stated that the Artic Ice would be completely melted by 2014, but he is incorrect then and now.  Jan. 6, 2012: The Coast Guard Cutter Healy breaks ice around the Russian-flagged tanker Renda 250 miles south of Nome. The Healy is the Coast Guard’s only currently operating polar icebreaker. The vessels are transiting through ice up to five-feet thick in this area. The 370-foot tanker Renda will have to go through more than 300 miles of sea ice to get to Nome, a city of about 3,500 people on the western Alaska coastline that did not get its last pre-winter fuel delivery because of a massive storm. (7) Let's go back to 2007-2008 and see if his claim was justified in the Artic Ice activity.  Hmmm... It seems that he is incorrect, but let's look further into the near past. How about 2012-2013? (8) We all remember the Climate Scientists that got stuck in Arctic Ice Earlier last year correct? Then a Russian Ice Breaker tried to free them, but got stuck. Can you guess what they were studying? They had predicted that all the Arctic Ice had melted due to Global Warming and that Earth would get flooded massively. Boy were they wrong. (9)  (10)  Dr. Koonin, former head of the Department of Energy under President Obama, has stated that the Global Warming scare is not suttle. This is because that he has found 3 things wrong and highly incorrect about the scare. 1. Shrinking of Artic Sea ice doesn't acount for the gaining of the Antartic ice. 2. The warming of Earth's temps today is the same as it was 30 years ago. 3. The sea levels rose at the same height and rate in the 20th cenury. (11)  Contention 4: Sea Levels  Here is another corralation that must happen. If the Ice Caps are completely melted as Pro claims then the sea level would have risen completely drowning tons of land.  The graph above is raw satellite image data of the sea level rise over an 8 year period showing that there is little to no change in the Sea Levels rising. (12) The sea level rises, on average, about 3 inches per century and it has been found to not even been rising at all.  This graph is the sea levels off the cost of French Guyana which is one of the areas which is predicted to be flooded due to Global Warming, but as you can see by the graph (which goes to 2008) the sea level is currently on a downward trend. (13) The source is the PDF within the link.Contention 5: The Weather My opponent is claiming that Hurricanes are increasing due to Global Warming, but this claim is indeed false! The hurricanes since the year 1900 to 2008 have actually been decreasing. The slope of this downward slope is .0016. Though it is small the hurricanes are still in a downward trend.As a matter of fact not only are Hurricanes on a downward trend, but they are at an all time low as in the year 2010, there was only 68 Hurricanes Globally, which is an all time low in the past 40 years. How about Tornados you may ask?In the graph above you can see that tornados are at an all time low in the past 60 years! (14) But what about Hurricanes?Here is a graph showing the number of days between hurricanes and this shows that the number of days between hurricanes is greatest at 76 days between hurricanes.The slope of this line is zero showing no trend of a massive storm increase.</t>

    <t>My opponent agreed that the rule violation is a misunderstanding (see comments section). Whether you want to leave it alone or make it a conduct loss is up to the voters.  Now let's get to the debate. I also appologize if I do not get to everything ahead of time as I will likely run out of characters. Contention 1: CO2 and Temperatures. Firstly let bring up just how much these accused compounds exactly warm the Earth's atmosphere. CO2 for example has the global warming potential of 1. Here are the other numbers. Carbon Dioxide -- 1Methane -- 21Nitrous Oxide -- 298-310CFC's -- VariousWater Vapor -- 0.25 [1] Now I just want you to keep this in mind for this next part here. We may observe that humans release approximately 35 gigatons of CO2 a year. [2] This is only 4.3% of the total amount of all Global Warming Gasses, however it is incrediably small when it comes to comparing the rest of the Global Warming gasses. If we observe the chart bellow we can see that Water Vapor is a large Contributor to Global Warming at 95% and CO2 comes in second. But here's the kicker. If we look at the Human contributed part that I'm about to post in the graph bellow we can see that it's very miniscule of 0.117% of all total Warming gasses. Now let's do some quick math here. CO2's increase was from what my opponent is claiming is from 295 ppm to 400ppm, a total of only 105 ppm. 1 Gigaton of CO2 is the equilivent of 2.13 ppm. [3] This means that increase of 105 ppm means a total of 49.29 gigatons. Since 1 gigaton of CO2 is the equivilance of .004% of the Greenhouse effect that means that 49.29 gigatons means an aditional .21% increase to Global Warming. This would account for a grand total of a 0.15 F increase in global temperature. This is a very measly amount and we can see that with my opponent's claims a simple 0.15 F increase isn't enough to melt glacers and have the effeccts that he is speaking of and it proves that this is NAUTRAL not man-made to fulfil his effects if they were real. Now remind yourself that Pro said in Round 2 that CO2 is responsable for LARGE amount of Global Warming. As we can plainly see here that this is incorrect.  My opponent goes and attempts to manipulate data by showing back as far as 1955, but when we push things back to the year 1900 we can see that temperature levels are actually decreasing on a linear slope.    Let us observe the above graph. Here I would like to point out the that the increase from Pre-Inustrial to Industrial era and the doubling of the CO2 leveling lead to a decrease in it's temperature.  Also we can see that the 10 mile 'hot-spot' above the tropics is actually absent. 'The computer models show that greenhouse warming will cause a hot-spot at an altitude between 8 and 12 km over the tropics between 30 N and 30 S. The temperature at this hot-spot is projected to increase at a rate of two to three times faster than at the surface. However, the Hadley Centre's real-world plot of radiosonde temperature observations shown below does not show the projected CO2 induced global warming hot-spot at all. The predicted hot-spot is entirely absent from the observational record. This shows that atmosphere warming theory programmed into climate models are wrong.' [4] Contention 2: Earth is cooling  Here we can see the plotted Global Warming Hot Spot that was suppose to be there according to the IPPC, however we'll see that they're wrong.   Why, it appears that this hotspot doesn't even exist! [7]  You're probably asking yourself, why am I seeing this graph again? This is because the more CO2 we get the less warming there is. If we observe this graph we can see that the Warming has decreased with more CO2 that we've recieved. This shows that CO2 doesn't have that much of an impact on the tempterature like the math that I've proved it in my last contention. [5]   Now I will agree that Eastbrook isn't good with predicting temperature change, but the IPCC is even worse, but whatever is causing the change it is highly unlikely that it's man made. Contention 3: Artic and Sea Levels  THough my opponent likes to blow things out of perportion we can see that these sea levels rise and fall on their own. It's a natural cycle as I showed last round. The trend shows only a mere +/- 0.30 mm per year. 'The Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory estimates the rate of sea level rise at 1.42 plus or minus 0.14 mm/year for the period 1954 to 2003. This is less than the estimate of 1.91 plus or minus 0.14 mm/year for the period 1902 to 1953, indicating a slowing of the rate.' [6] We can see that 2.8 inches per 50 years isn't that much of an appocolyptic threat.  Here is a graph from NOAA which shows that the sea level rise is very small and that the IPCC is way off as well as many other Warming 'experts'. [8]  In the above graph we can see that despit Artic Ice slightly decreasing we can see that it follows the same patern throughout the year as the Ice melts in the summer and freezes in the winter. We can see that my opponents' sea ice level predictions are incorrect. [9] Which if sea ice is decreasing then explain the great sea ice exspansion of Antartica in 2012 shown bellow. It had a total of 20,000 miles more ice than average.  Contention 4: Weather  The NOAA has shown that Tornados are less frequent and occur less and less. Now the irony behind this is that it comes out at the same time as my opponent's sources which claims the exact opposite. [10] Also I do wish that my opponet reposts link number 7 as it is broken and I cannot access it, so for now I continue to extend across my NOAA Hurricane graphs from last round. Contention 5: Ocean Acidfication Here I Would like to report that we do not emmitt Cobalt2. (I know you meant CO2) If we do some basic Chemistry we can see that 1-6 on the pH scale is acid 7 is neutral and 8-14 is base. The Ocean on average is 8.2 which is a base. Now let's add in the factor of the average coral reef needs CO2 and the average reef can varry from 9.2 to 7.6 throughout the day and night showing that there is no accidfication. This CO2 added envirnment has been seen to increase coral growth by 2 cm per year. We can also see that these areas very by 0.3 pH pending on the area.</t>

    <t>;Thank you, lannan13. Please note that the first few arguments are identical to that of my last global warming debate as my opponent could not finish the last one and has decided to redo this.==Contention 1: The correlation between increase in Carbon Dioxide and global temperature==Throughout the last 650,000 years, there have been seven cycles of glacial advances and retreats, where the carbon dioxide levels abruptly increased, then gradually decreased afterward. However, in 1950, Co2 levels were at a critical level and kept on rising. As of 2014, the global Co2 levels were at an all time high of nearly 400 parts per million [1]:2 has increased since the Industrial Revolution. (Source: [[LINKAs we can see above, in the last 650,000 years, the Co2 levels have never grown above 300 ppm, as opposed to now, where the Co2 levels are at 400 ppm. Obviously, this abrupt growth in Co2 levels are caused by human activity, such as mass production, the use of electricity, polluting, etc.I have provide a youtube video above to show the correlation between the high Co2 levels and global temperature [2]. When both are compared, this becomes irrefutable evidence that man-made global warming exists.In fact, as of 2013, the average global temperature was 14.6 degrees Celsius (58.3 degrees Fahrenheit), which is 0.8 degrees Celsius (1.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than when the year was 1880, and 0.6 degrees Celsius (1.1 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the mid-20th century baseline [3][4][5]: Already, on the first contention, we have seen major evidence affirming the resolution.==Contention 2: The cause and effect of the Greenhouse Effect and what makes it more powerful==The greenhouse effect on Planet Earth has been occurring for almost its whole life and is a natural phenomenon, since greenhouse gases such as Co2 have existed on Earth from its birth, thus heating the Earth to help sustain forms of life [6]:'To its credit, the greenhouse effect has been around long before humans began to burn fossil fuels, and it is a natural phenomenon in that makes life habitable for all living things.' [6]The greenhouse effect operates when the sun's heat passes through Earth's atmosphere, heats the Earth's surface and is reflected back upward. Most of this heat is absorbed by the greenhouse gases like water vapor, Co2 and methane. Afterward, the heat is re-emited in all directions, thus starting the cycle again, continuously heating the Earth. Greenhouse gases literally act like a thermal blanket for Earth [7]:of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide – act as a thermal blanket for the Earth, absorbing heat and warming the surface to a life-supporting average of 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius).' /gt; 'A layer of greenhouse gases – primarily water vapor, and including much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide – act as a thermal blanket for the Earth, absorbing heat and warming the surface to a life-supporting average of 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius).' [7]From this information, we can conclude that the more greenhouse gases are put into the atmosphere, the more heat from the sun is absorbed, thus creating a powerful greenhouse effect. Human actvity is causing this to happen.P1) The more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the more powerful the greenhouse effectP2) Human activity is emitting more greenhouse gases into the atmosphereC) Human activity is the cause of a more powerful greenhouse effect, and thus man-made global warming exists.To further prove this point, let us inspect Earth's neighboring planets, Mars and Venus.Mars' atmosphere is quite thin, and it's nearly completely made up of Co2. However, it is because of the low atmospheric pressure and lack of other greenhouse gases that the greenhouse effect is not at all strong and thus Mars has a frozen surface without any signs of organisms [7].'Not enough greenhouse effect: The planet Mars has a very thin atmosphere, nearly all carbon dioxide. Because of the low atmospheric pressure, and with little to no methane or water vapor to reinforce the weak greenhouse effect, Mars has a largely frozen surface that shows no evidence of life.' [7]Now, let us inspect Venus.Despite Venus' atmosphere also being almost entirely carbon dioxide, the amount of Co2 Venus contains is about 300 times as much as Mars' or Earth's. This creates a HUGELY powerful greenhouse effect, causing a temperature so high that lead could not stay solid. [7]'Too much greenhouse effect: The atmosphere of Venus, like Mars, is nearly all carbon dioxide. But Venus has about 300 times as much carbon dioxide in its atmosphere as Earth and Mars do, producing a runaway greenhouse effect and a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead.' [7]Again this information is major evidence of the existence of man-made global warming.==Conclusion==I have put forward major evidence and arguments proving the existence of man-made global warming. I have also put out evidence that the greenhouse effect does indeed exist.Thus, the resolution is affirmed.</t>

<h>Got it. From this round I will refer to Carbon Dioxide as CO2.Also, my round 2 sites are incorrectly entered. Here they are in respective order. ==Rebuttal 1:  CO2 and its effects==The statement that humans are not contributing to the emission of greenhouse gases is completely false. Many sites [1-3] point out that humans are, in fact, the most major cause of warming in modern days.'Natural changes alone can’t explain the temperature changes we’ve seen.' - Union of Concerned Scientists [2]'Scientists have closed the case: Human activity is causing the Earth to get hotter.' - Environmental Defense Fund [3]And, if we were to agree with my opponent's logic, then his arguments are contradictory to his third graph - where he states that Carbon Dioxide is correlating with temperatures perfectly, which is true [4][5]: Keep in mind that both charts show increasing temperature and temperature increase rates, but short after the Industrial Revolution began, contrary to my opponent's selective graphs where he tries to disprove warming by selecting a range of 10,000 years, when really the Industrial Revolution only started in the 18th century [6]. My opponent's third graph, as proven, is contradicted by my opponent's statements above. Let us look at his two halves of his chart combined [7]: If the warming effect of CO2 is minimal, then how would the temperature correlate with it so perfectly? And even then, in the years before, the temperature would drop almost instantly after it reached its peak, but the warming period we are in is actually holding itself up there, rather than just being pulled down. Also, we cannot use this graph anyway as the time scale is way too large to see our effects in recent years. Moreover, his charts could be misleading as he has not cited any links to substantiate his second, third and fourth charts. Let us look at his fourth chart.His fourth chart tells us that water vapor and other natural causes cover the vast majority of contributions to the greenhouse effect, whilst human emissions only cover about 0.28% of contributions. However, this is very misleading, because it does not count in ANY OTHER FACTORS. For example, we already know that humans have deforestated the vast majority of forests on Earth [8]:Wildfires, which already contribute to the greenhouse effect [9], are affecting the area of forests worldwide [8]:           Trends in wildlife area burned in wildfire in U.S.    '“Wildfire emissions can have remarkable impacts on radiative forcing,” says Liu.' - USDA [9] 'Tropical deforestation contributes as much as 90% of the current net release of biotic carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This change may represent as much as 20% - 30% of the total carbon flux due to humans - i.e., rivaling the carbon release due to fossil fuel burning.' - Global Change [9]Humans, as shown bove, are acidifying the ocean and deforestating (cutting down trees from forests), which is labeled as one of the more major causes of the greenhouse effect on my opponent's chart. As for my opponent's logarithm argument, this is also contradicting the correlation of CO2 and temperatures because the logarithm would not be able to cause a perfect correlation. Thus this argument is null.==Rebuttal 2: The Earth is cooling==My opponent states that his hot spot argument was dropped, when in reality I had responded to this with two paragraphs of evidence. My opponent is straw-manning here. My opponent even goes on to state that I dropped his CO2 argument, to which I responded with even more text. That went unrefuted by my opponent.Also, the 'Hockey Stick' graph is actually proven many times to be quite accurate (at least in the warming period) by studies of different sources, like corals, stalagmites, tree rings, boreholes and ice cores. All confirm that the 20th century saw the most dramatic increase in global temperatue in recent history.'Since the hockey stick paper in 1998, there have been a number of proxy studies analysing a variety of different sources including corals, stalagmites, tree rings, boreholes and ice cores. They all confirm the original hockey stick conclusion: the 20th century is the warmest in the last 1000 years and that warming was most dramatic after 1920.' - Skeptical Science [10]Note that my opponent's next graph is a very selective one and that its time scale is literally over a ten-year period. Plus, the grap shows the temperature variations, which ends up being above zero. This graph is contradictory to my opponent's arguments.Also, my opponent's quote and evidence that global warming as stopped is also quite selective as it is over a period of 8 years. My opponent is blatantly biased as he only used selective time periods instead of an actually unbiased time period, where it focuses on where humans have been speculated to have started to contribute to global warming.==Rebuttal 3: Arctic Ice and Sea Levels==Again, my opponent's graph here only shows a time period of 45 years. Let us look at a graph starting from 0 CE, and as we can see towards the end the sea level rises dramatically [11]:s://motherjones.com...; alt='Different ways to measure sea level over time' /gt; As you can see the sea level has risen over 20 cm since the start of the Industrial Revolution and has been very consistent throughout this period.My opponent then goes on to reinstate his argument that Arctic Ice is increasing, which I had already refuted with my NASA evidence, which was collected in late 2014, while my opponent uses data from 2006 and 2013. Even then, my opponent only uses two photographs of the Arctic Ice, each from two single, separate days, which again is subjective because it doesn't show anything over time, but rather it only shows separate days. Again disregard this piece of evidence. Also, even though I concede the Antarctic Ice expansion, I had proven Arctic Ice was losing ice more than twice as fast than the Antarctic Ice grew. Thus this point is null.==Rebuttal 4: Hurricanes and Tornadoes==My opponent drops my argument that tornadoes do not link to global warming.My opponent is misunderstanding my hurricane intensity argument. It has been shown that when sea levels rise (which I proved true) stronger hurricanes get stronger, but weaker hurricanes show little to no trend. [12]'But more significantly, Elsner found weaker hurricanes showed little to no trend while stronger hurricanes showed a greater upward trend. In other words, stronger hurricanes are getting stronger. This means that as sea temperatures continue to rise, the number of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes hitting land will inevitably increase.' - Skeptical Science [12]My opponent even states that I dropped his R2 graph, which I responded to throughout the debate. The link was only broken. My opponent keeps straw-manning that I drop his arguments when a lot of my arguments have been left unrefuted. I ask my opponent to stop.==Rebuttal 5: Ocean Acidification==My opponent is saying that since the ocean has not acidified to a certain point that can be deemed critical. However my opponent must notice that small parts of the ocean are acidifying to the point that organisms are dying and being replaced with anaerobic organisms, which produce methane, which further contributes to global warming. Parts of this are directly caused by normal everyday pollution, which an kill animals and bleach corals, which has been proven above to have alreday happened.==Dropped arguments== My opponent drops the following arguments/rebuttals:- That CO2 levels have been ising exponentially over the last few centuries- That CO2 levels 600,000,000 years ago are irrelevant since not even the dinosaurs had existed then- That my opponents graphs are very selective and biased- That the Arctic is losing ice more than twice as fast than the Antarctic is gaining ice- That tornadoes do not have a link to global warming- That ocean acidification, even if not at a critical level, is affecting the temperature of the surroundings.I would like to remind my opponent that he must not respond to these dropped arguments in the last round as I cannot respond to them. Any new rebuttals to these dropped arguments should be disregarded.==Conclusion==I have effectively refuted all my opponent's arguments, countered my own, and also proven that my opponent has dropped some of my arguments.The resolution is affirmed.</h>

    <t>Let's begin..   Case Defense   I-Cost   I would like to say that I am truly apologetic for the misunderstanding concerning cost however the con’s demands are very unfair and limiting. I will agree that it is abusive for me to change the cost and the distance in the plan during the second round but the change comes far from the middle of the debate; so what is the impact of my abuse on the round itself? Whatever it may be I would like to point out that it should not be that the con team gets to fabricate their own price, that is unfair and that is abusive. If the con should get to decide his own price then the debate is literally already over because he can fabricate a price as high as he wants, is that fair…remember that I Never said that the price listed was wrong, I simply showed that I couldn’t support the price because I don’t have the proper evidence I Do have evidence which supports a cost though, and I have presented that evidence. The con team cannot deny this. Con wants to label me a cheater and an abuser because I have been forced to alter the plan, yet he wishes to create a falsified price in order to make it impossible for me to win thus ironically being the abuser himself. This is the resolution to the problem which I will propose and like it or not this is simply the only reasonable option remaining in the round. I see that it is abusive to change things in the round. I have changed 2 things, the distance and showed proof for a different cost. Thus I will keep the distance at 49,515 miles of construction for a cost of 8.1 billion dollars. This does nothing but help con, it may not help him as much as letting him fabricate a price but it still definitely helps his case while hurting mine. To be honest I have no qualms about this price because it can still get paid off if 1 hurricane with the median cost strikes the US. This really only extends the payoff time to 4.5 years as well which is really not bad. Take it as my word, the plan will not be changed any longer. I would also specify that the plan will be paid for through normal means.    II-Cost II Here is exactly why your price is invalid, again I will reiterate. Con is literally claiming that because artificial reefs have the qualities of an artificial breakwater that they actually are artificial breakwaters. This is simply illogical and is analogous to claiming that a sponge, for instance, is the same as a straw because they both suck things up. It is completely irrational and should be invalidated as any sort of point.    III-States I dislike that con and pro are playing some sort of sematics/interpretation game but here is the fact on this. I clearly stated that the plan will take place on All Feasable Costal States, I then gave some Examples of a few costal states, If con misinterpreted the plan text then that is unfortunate but the way any rational person would understand it, is as I would in my opinion and thus I wont go into this very much.    IV-Trade Con has ignored my evidence. It is impossible to for a ship to get caught on any reefs I will build as they will be from 12-30 miles off of the coast line which is as deep as 400 meters deep. It would literally be impossible for any ship to get caught on our artificial reefs at this distance as I have proven. If con disagrees he cannot prove the contrary by citing cases where a ship has gotten caught on a Regular Reef that is not even between 12-30 miles off of the coast. Really con needs to find quoted evidence proving that artificial reefs which are never more than 10 feet tall would somehow block all trade in the US while in water that is at least 300 meters deep.         Case Offense   Aids/HIV   A.)  Staggering numbers of people have HIV and are dying from the epidemic World Health Organization [Since the beginning of the epidemic, almost 78 million people have been infected with the HIV virus and about 39 million people have died of HIV. Globally, 35.0 million [33.2–37.2 million] people were living with HIV at the end of 2013.]    B.)  As stated in first round, Coral reefs provide a plethora of cures to diseases. The government has literally found a protein derived from coral reefs that prevents the spread of HIV National, April 29, 2014, 'Coral reefs provide potent new anti-HIV proteins,' EurekAlert!. [Testing the proteins against laboratory strains of HIV, the researchers found that cnidarians were highly potent, blocking HIV at miniscule concentrations—one billionth of a gram. They worked by binding to the virus and preventing it from fusing with the CD4 membrane. “It’s always thrilling when you find a brand-new protein that nobody else has ever seen before,” senior investigator Barry O’Keefe, PhD, deputy chief of the Molecular Targets Laboratory at the National Cancer Institute’s Center for Cancer Research, said in a release. “And the fact that this protein appears to block HIV infection—and to do it in a completely new way—makes this truly exciting.”] Furthermore [Researchers will now look to produce larger amounts of the proteins for further testing. “Making more of it is a big key,” O’Keefe said. “You can’t strip the Earth of this coral trying to harvest this protein, so our focus now is on finding ways to produce more of it so we can proceed with preclinical testing.”] Now folks, logically, what might be the result of creating a utopia of coral reefs in the U.S.? Simply put, the preventative cure for HIV. The evidence above states that the only thing needed is More Coral Reefs, the plan provides and thus will significantly reduce the amount of HIV/AIDs in the world and US given more time to do research.      Fisheries I-Status quo of the fishing industry and environment A.)  Fisheries Doomed If every coral reef in the world was a strictly protected area, and if every fisherman was prevented from fishing, unlikely as these options are, coral reef fisheries could still not recover. Many or most reef habitats are already so badly degraded that they cannot regain the carrying capacity for economically valued species that they formerly had.    B.)  Fishing methods are unsustainable, industry wont change The richest countries like the European Union, the United States, Japan are the most damaging, and 90% of the top predatory fish are now gone (Myers and Worm, 2003)...the coral reef habitat and thereby the future fisheries are permanently destroyed    C.)   Situation is getting worse the degradation of marine ecosystems and fisheries can only be expected to worsen    D.)  The situation is getting worse II areas are too severely degraded to allow recovery of corals, fish, and invertebrates to former levels because the habitat quality is so badly degraded that reefs have lost most of their carrying capacity for these species. Even if every reef was strictly protected and all fishermen were eliminated today, the fisheries would still not be able to recover to former levels. There is no doubt that over-fishing has been disastrous almost everywhere (Pauly et al.,1998; 2000)    II-Significance/Harm of Reef Degradation A.)  impact on countries Over 100 countries could lose their major source of marine biodiversity, beach sand supplies, tourism, fisheries, and coastal protection in the next few years if current trends continue, with severe but incalculably high economic losses (Goreau and Hayes, this volume).      III-Solvency: what do we do now and what are the benefits?   A.)  Now is The Time to Start Saving Reefs The tools are now in our hands for saving coral reef and oyster reef ecosystems from extinction from over-harvesting, global warming, and pollution, protecting coastlines from global sea level rise, increasing fisheries, and saving beaches and tourism economies. There is of course a real cost, but the sooner large scale investments are made in marine ecosystem restoration the greater the benefits will be and the lower the expenditures needed. There is now no other alternative to effectively reverse global marine degradation that is accelerating out of control except to do nothing.    B.)  Mineral Accretion is now the only effective way to revive our reefs and fishing industry Large-scale habitat restoration of degraded areas is now the only hope for recovery of the coastal fisheries, biodiversity, sand supplies, and shore protection that only large healthy reefs can provide. Unless the vast wastelands of degraded reefs are restored, all tropical coastal countries will soon face crippling economic losses. Unfortunately, at this time there is no serious funding for large-scale coral reef restoration.    C.)   Healing Powers of Mineral Accretion In the Maldives Biorock [Mineral accretion] reefs have effectively absorbed wave energy that they have turned an eroding beach into a growing one (Goreau, Hilbertz, Hakeem and Hameed, 2000). In Indonesia dense schools of fish in Biorock [Mineral accretion] structures have caused fishermen to start building similar structures to increase catches (Goreau and Hilbertz, 2001). Settlement of larval corals can take place at exceptionally high densities, hundreds per square meter, under conditions where poor water quality has prevented all settlement on natural substrates (Goreau and Hilbertz, 1996). Larval and adult fishes are attracted to these structures at exceptional densities, quickly forming schools so dense that one cannot see across the structures.   D.)  The Value of Reefs While most benefits of coral reefs can not possibly be quantified in monetary terms, such as the value of biodiversity, biogeochemical cycling services, and esthetic beauty, three of them are amenable to direct economic valuation: fisheries, tourism, and shore protection   E.)   Monetary Estimate of the value of reefs When considered as earnings per kilometer of reefs, the values for fisheries and for tourism typically ranged from several thousand dollars to several million dollars per kilometer of reef per year   no space for a summary, but citations in comments section.

    <t>1. Pro has never claimed that this is policy debate   (From the Government agency rebuttal) 1.) The plan will be carried out through Normal Means, Just as Every Single Policy Debate Plan Is.   Policy: a high-level overall plan embracing the general goals and acceptable procedures especially of a governmental body. Plan text: The USFG should increase construction of mineral accretion coral reefs in the US   Therefore, as the United States Federal Government is accomplishing this and it is a high level plan, this is a debate on policy making it policy debate. The pro stating that they never claimed to be doing a policy debate does not excuse the fact that the resolution implies it.   2. The ‘entire point’ of policy debate is NOT to evaluate a plan, but is to promote education and learning.   Policy debate is a form of debate competition in which teams of two advocate for and against a resolution that typically calls for policy change by the United States federal government. While the con generally frowns on the use of Wikipedia as a main source, the description is accurate and relies on multiple debate organizations for their definition. More importantly, it’s more evidence than the pro, who holds the burden of proof, has provided.     3.Con wishes to implement his own price, which I will later explain doesn’t make sense anyways, thus making the round literally impossible to win   The pro has not explicitly stated in any round how the con is fabricating prices. As the con made sure to use the evidence provided by the pro, in addition to simple mathematics, it’s impossible for the con to have fabricated a price that was not equal to the actual cost of the plan.   This destroys the educational value of the debate because there can be no education if there is no round in the first place. Not only this, but it wastes space in the debate reducing the amount we can argue that actually has educational value. The educational value is elicited by those viewing this debate. It will teach them to not amend their plan or otherwise change rules without stating them in their 1AC, thereby destroying the structure of policy debate. In order to maintain the future of education, infractions must be addressed so as to keep them from becoming the norm.     This also hurts the sportsmanship of the game and promotes tension between the players. This clearly also hurts educational value.   This tension is irrelevant if any is felt. As the point of the debate is to evaluate the Affirmative teams plan, the con is not obliged to sidestep possibly sensitive subjects to the pro in order to keep their emotions manageable. However, the con recognizes that antagonizing the pro, or con for that matter, is not acceptable and apologizes if it appears that that was the goal.   Thus, Con’s propositions are abuses which far outweigh any abuses which I have committed and the second price should stand. Con has disproved abuse by the Negative team, therefore the issues that were stated previously still stand against them.     Price   1. Artificial reefs are NOT artificial breakwaters just because they have a similar sounding definition.   Actually, that’s exactly how something falls in to a category. The con has provided evidence of a category and used the pros own evidence to prescribe the actual cost resulting from this. The pro has failed to provide evidence that artificial reefs are not a type of artificial breakwater, thereby refusing to provide clash which is an integral part of education in a debate.   2. Thus the price of artificial breakwaters is NOT the same as the price of artificial reefs   See Price-1 for analytics that disprove this statement.   3.I also have provided quoted evidence from a massive study which declares artificial reefs of the mineral accretion assortment only cost 50,000-$100,000/ kilometer which equals about $75/meter, giving us a grand total of 8.1 billion dollars for the plan   The pro provided evidence on a possible cost of artificial reefs. However, as they never disproved that these man-made reefs were not a type of artificial breakwater, the con must assume the worst as the possibility of over 9 percent of the USFG budget being lost is still very real.   4.Thus because I have professional evidence and because Con is using completely flawed logic for his calculation, my answer is the one should remain in play   The con has used the pros own evidence and simple mathematics to determine the cost, unless the pro is claiming that their own evidence is actually flawed analytics. In that case, the pro argument is negated as they have then failed to provide any evidence of cost and con arguments still stand.     States 1. The plan literally states: “the plan will take place on all feasible coastal states” Again, the con reiterates that this is twisting the plan text by avoiding what is really said. The real plan text is as follows: The plan will take place on all feasible coastal states: (California, Louisiana, Texas, South Carolina, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, New Jersey, and Maine) are all up for consideration As the judges can see, the full sentence significantly changes the context. Instead of saying all feasible coastal states of the USA, it specifically defines the states up for consideration. This is an issue when there are specific states, defined earlier in the debate, that have been hit by hurricanes and are not protected. 2. The plan doesn’t Ever state: “only the listed states will be up for consideration” This is correct, the plan does not state this. However, the plan ends up doing what this sentence implies as proven in States-1.   3. This means that the con is using semantics and assumptions which aren’t based on what is literally in the plan text, while I am. The con disagrees that it is using semantics when the subject is whether or not the plan actually does what the pro claims it will do. Considering the plan is supposed to protect people endangered by hurricanes, the blatant dismissal of threatened states must be addressed.   4.Finally the plan also states that I affirm the right to clarify my case as necessary, meaning if there is a simply word confusion, like this, I can clarify what it really means.   Clarify: to make (something) easier to understand. The pro implies that this is difficult to understand, however the con is having no issue in reading the text. The dilemma is the fact that this plan is explicitly defining the states that can be evaluated. In fact, the line below it specifically excludes Alaska. 5.Thus my and the literally states interpretation must be the accepted version   The pro never provided a definition. Their interpretation is that the con is wrong which is not a counter definition nor a clarification.   6.Thus please strike out the states disadvantage   Using evidence from above, pro argument is effectively dropped, flow to con.   Government agency 1.The plan will be carried out through Normal Means, Just as Every Single Policy Debate Plan Is. The con recommends that the pro browse through the open evidence project. It has plenty of policy debates that have actual funding programs and agents of action. This means that the plan will be carried out in the normal way that congress would pass/fund/and operate any given plan. Congress funds and operates any given plan by finding a source for the money and an agent of action. As the Pro has never been able to define either, con argument stands.   2. Thus the agent of action and funding are all taken care of See Government agency-3   3. the agent of action is not critical to supporting the educational value of the debate   As pro never defines what is actually educational, the con will state that the agent of action is critical to supporting the educational value of this debate, thereby negating them as they are using analytics as well. 4. Thus it doesn’t matter in any case   This is an unreasonable jump in logic, suggesting that no entity in the USFG acting as an agent of action matters. The con will call this untopical and leave it at that as it provides no worth to debate this under the resolution.   5. There is no rule which mandates that an agent me named   The con will assume that the pro meant ‘an agent be named’. And this is true, no one has to execute the plan by your text, therefore no one will, therefore billions will be wasted on a plan that no one is executing.   6. Thus I have not broken any rules and no abuse has been done   The abuse lies in the claims that the con is fabricating claims in addition to complaints about the con not allowing amendments to the plan text at the whim of the pro. The con assumes that the pro is at least somewhat familiar with the basis of policy debate to respect the base structure of it and demands that it be given so as to allow for structured debate instead of letting emotional bias take effect.   Trade Pro failed to provide counter evidence. The plan also does not establish the distance that they claim the reefs will be at from shore.  Fisheries The fisheries evidence came from the pro, so the pro trying to discredit their own evidence is not showing a healthy and well made plan. The con has already provided the evidence and quotes needed to negate the pros arguments in the previous round, extend them and note that the first quote from con in the previous round still negates the pro arguments as they came from the pros own evidence. The shore protection, as stated in the previous round, is covered under the state protection disad.   Tourism Pro evidence claims that artificial coral reefs are made of the same material as a coral reef, calcium. Therefore the same dangers to biodiversity apply unless the pro had proven that these man-made reefs would be stronger.</t>

    <t>CASE DEFENSE  I. COST A.) Cost of the plan itselfCon has claimed the the price of the plan will be somewhere around 9% of the GDP using his personal calculations. Con has however pointed something of concern out. The plan I presented was premade by someone else and thus I have no idea how the calculations came about, this means I cannot support the plans stated cost however using evidence I found, which I know is correct, I came out with another answer. The number is much higher the one listed in the plan, yet Much Much smaller than the fabricated price that con created. My calculations resulted in a price of 7.2 billion dollars, I then cut the distance in the plan from 49,515 to just 30,000 miles leaving us with a price of 3.6 billion dollars, a price which I can still easily justify… But before I tell you how I got that answer let’s examine why con came out with the wrong answer. Christopher used his 2014 Department of Interior citation (I’ll refer to it as the DOI from now on) stating that the average cost of building an artificial breakwater is [$19, 791 per 1 meter] he then multiplied this DOI estimate times the number of meters constructed in the plan. This gave him the answer of 9% of the GDP. The real cost of construction per meter is not $19,791 because the plan does not call for the construction of Artificial Breakwaters, it calls for the construction of Mineral Acceretion Artificial Reefs, two different things. The real cost is found in my first citation which is a study by the coral reef alliance using the results of at least 12 other credited studies: “each kilometer of shoreline can be protected for about $50,000 to $100,000 [using mineral accretion]. This is only around 0.3 to 0.6% of the cost of a conventional sea wall, which provides no tourism or fisheries benefits.” Here is the exact method I used to get my answer of $3.6 b: $75,000/1kilometer = $75,000/ 0.62 mile = $120,967.75/ 1 mile Now I can use a proportion to find the price of 30,000 miles of reef construction: $120,967.75/1mi  =  $X/ 30,000mi    (cross multiply)    X= $3,629,032,500 or about 3.6 billion dollarsB.) Time the plan needs to pay itself offIm my evidence from Accuweather given above, the median cost of a hurricane is 9 billion dollars and the average is 1.8 billion (dont understand the differenc but thats what they said) this means that if one hurricane with the median price range strikes (9b), then the plan has paid for itself 2.5x over! even if a hurricane with the average cost strikes (1.8b) the plan is paid off by only 2 hurricanes. This sharply contrasts con's evidence stating that the plan will take hundred of years. Keep in mind that the biggest hurricanes like Hurricane Katrina costes the US about 125 billion dollars in revenue.But how long will it take for those hurricanes to strike?Dina Spector, 8-29-2012, 'When Will The Next Nightmare Hurricane Hit The US? 'In an average decade the mainland U.S. gets hit with about seven Category 1 hurricanes, four to five hurricanes that rank as Category 2 and about the same number that hit as Category 3 hurricanes, but just one Category 4 hurricane.'That's 1.7 hurricanes per year meaning the plan will almost certainly be paid of in less than 2 and half years.II. Fails to Protect all states A.) Con has misinterprited the plan textCon has stated that I must exclude all states I didn’t list in the plan from having coral construction done on them however this is simply untrue. If I reference my plan text it clearly states that: “The plan will take place on all feasible costal states” that means that unless it is impossible or would result in the downfall of the plan, those states will be constructed on.III. Trade DisadvantageA.) False evidence Con predicates his entire argument on one ship that is currently stuck in okinawa, not only does this Not prove that ships will Always get stuck, it also doesnt neccisarily apply to Mineral Accretion Coral Reefs because they are different things. In order for this argument to remain con must prove that mineral accretion coral reefs will cause shipping accidents using credible sources. I will also use further reasoning to show that this argument holds no substance. This is a picture of the ship off of Okinawa, it is small however if you look you can see that it is nowhere close to 12 to 30 miles off of the coast as required by the plan.It is plainly impossible for a ship to get caught on something  200-300 meters deep which is the depth of the ocean between 12-30 miles off the coast.CASE OFFENSEFurther Explanation of the Plan A.) Mineral AccretionThe plan calls for a vast area to be converted into reefs using mineral accretion. In my own words here is mineral accretion: electricity runs through a piece of metal which rests in the ocean. Through the proccesses of chemistry the electricity in the metal pulls out certain elements and compound floating around in the water which harden on the metal, usually limestone. If you have ever seen white stuff around your fosset that is the stuff that hardens on it. As it turns out the electricity and the the limestone offer corrals the energy they need to constantly grow and feed. Mineral Accretion also creates superior resilience to the effect of global warming and increases growth rates of the coral dramatically, its like corals on steroids. Now here is the technical stuff:definition of MA (mineral accretion): Mineral accretion is a new method that uses low voltage direct current electricity to grow solid limestone rock structures in the sea and accelerate the growth of corals providing homes for reef fish and protecting the shoreline. The electrical current causes minerals that are naturally dissolved in seawater to precipitate and adhere to a metal structure.The result is a composite of limestone and brucite with mechanical strength similar to concrete. Derived from seawater, this material is similar to the composition of natural coral reefs and tropical sand beaches.  In the plan the government will use industrial grade aquatic wire mesh and adhere it to the ocean, then run a current through it (1.2 volts, a AA battery has 1.5 volts) which will begin the proccesses of mineral accretion. Mineral accretion begins in just hours and will be finished within a few months, corals will then start to attach themselves to the mesh and reproduce causing a flourishing environment to grow for miles on end, with 80% of corals now dead in the caribean it is easy to see why we need this in America.But what about global warming? wont it just kill off the rest of the reefs when we plant them? No. 'Corals were grown at sites in Jamaica where all the corals in the nearby reef had been killed by algae overgrowth caused by high nutrients, and where no new coral settlement was taking place. These had coral growth rates up to three to five times the record rates for many species, and settlement of hundreds of corals per square meter (Goreau and Hilbertz, 1996).'Biorock is a technology which harnesses the same power of mineral accretion, they have used their technology in certain areas and seen amazing results:'Corals grown in the Maldives on Biorock structures had 50-80% survival from the severe high temperature bleaching events that killed 95-99% of the corals on surrounding reefs (Goreau, Hilbertz, Hakeem and Hameed, 2000). Survival of Biorock corals was from 16 to 50 times greater than surrounding habitats (Figure 1). A large population of corals was being grown in the same habitat using conventional cementing methods and being used as controls to compare growth'  B.) Previous ArgumentsPlease note the the opponent has conceeded the humanitarian benifits of the plan such as cures and further innovations for disease and the amount of lives we save by implimenting coral reefsSummary: We have deterined the cost of the plan to be 3.6 billion dollars which will repay itself within no more than 2 and a half years, furthermore we have discredited con's second argument because he simply misinterprited the plan text. On Con's final disadvantage he states that implementing MA reefs will halt all trade however he doesnt have substantial evidence to support this claim and I have shown that all MA reefs will be well below the depth of passing ships. After concluding this things I moved away from Defense contentions to Offense contentions where I supported the strength and full out solvency of the plan while also explaining some of its details furthermore the con has conceeded that implimenting MA reefs will lead to cures for a plethora of diseases while also saving thousands of lives from hurricane mortalility. I look forward to the next round and I now pass the gauntlet to Con to craft his responses...</t>

    <t>Let's try and begin here:Fairness    Cons claim 1.)    The “entire point of [policy debate] is to evaluate the Affirmative team plan” 2.)    It is absolutely against the rules to ever change or amend a plan in a policy round 3.)    Pro has changed or amended the plan by changing the price 4.)    Pro has attempted to break the rule and has hurt fairness in the round 5.)    Thus, Pro has no more say and must accept con’s price of 9% of the GDP  Rebutal 1.)    Pro has never proclaimed or mandated that this is a policy debate 2.)    The ‘entire point’ of policy debate is NOT to evaluate a plan, but is to promote education and learning 3.)    Con wishes to implement his own price, which I will later explain doesn’t make sense anyways, thus making the round literally impossible to win 4.)    This destroys the educational value of the debate because there can be no education if there is no round in the first place. Not only this, but it wastes space in the debate reducing the amount we can argue that actually has educational value. 5.)    This also hurts the sportsmanship of the game and promotes tension between the players. This clearly also hurts educational value. 6.)    Thus, Con’s propositions are abuses which far outweigh any abuses which I have commited and the second price should stand.   Why pro’s price is dead wrong 1.)    Artificial reefs are artificial breakwaters because they have a similar definition 2.)    a DOI report indicates that artificial breakwaters cost $19,791 per meter. 3.)    He multiplied this number by the total meters in the plan to receive 9% of the GDP   Why this is wrong 1.)    Artificial reefs are NOT artificial breakwaters just because they have a similar sounding definition. 2.)    Thus the price of artificial breakwaters is NOT the same as the price of artificial reefs 3.)    I also have provided quoted evidence from a massive study which declares artificial reefs of the mineral accretion assortment only cost 50,000-$100,000/ kilometer which equals about $75/meter, giving us a grand total of 8.1 billion dollars for the plan 4.)    Thus because I have professional evidence and because Con is using completely flawed logic for his calculation, my answer is the one should remain in play   States 1.)    The plan literally states: “the plan will take place on all feasible coastal states” 2.)    The plan doesn’t Ever state: “only the listed states will be up for consideration” 3.)    This means that con is using sematics and assumtions which aren’t based on what is literally in the text, while I am. 4.)    Finally the plan also states that I affirm the right to clarify my case as necessary, meaning if there is a simply word confusion, like this, I can clarify what it really means. 5.)    Thus my and the literally stated interpretation must be the accepted version 6.)    Thus please strike out the states disadvantage   Government agency Cons claim 1.)    A governmental agency is necessary  to carry out the plan and funding must be named 2.)    Con doesn’t list them and that is abusive Rebutal 1.)    The plan will be carried out through Normal Means, Just as Every Single Policy Debate Plan Is. 2.)    This means that the plan will be carried out in the normal way that congress would pass/fund/ and operate any given plan 3.)    Thus the agent of action and funding are all taken care of 1.)     the agent of action is not critical to supporting the educational value of the debate 2.)    Thus it doesn’t matter in any case 1.)    There is no rule which mandates that an agent me named 2.)    Thus I have not broken any rules and no abuse has been done       Trade Pros claim 1.)    There are 4 examples of ships getting caught on something in the ocean 2.)    Thus every single ship will get caught 3.)    This will prevent all forms of trade costing the US billions or trillions 4.)    Thus don’t do the plan   Rebuttal 1.)    4 examples are not enough proof to make a general claim about every single ship in the world 2.)    Each example con listed was not in the range of 12-30 miles off of the coastline 3.)    Each example stems from ships either being to close to land or wrecking on a very small patch of land that suddenly goes from the bottom of the sea to about 30 meters below sea level causing the ship to get stuck 4.)    These have nothing to do with reefs or they are not within the coastal distance 5.)    Thus they cannot be applied to the case 6.)    Con must provide case specific evidence about Mineral Accretion coral reefs, from a quoted author that makes his same claims, single examples do not prove 7.)    Thus please cast out cons trade advantage   Fisheries   Solvency Pros claim 1.)    Con has evidence which claims it is currently to late for fisheries to heal just by halting fishing 2.)    Thus he has show the entire plan wont help because according to his evidence nothing will help 3.)    Thus delete the entire advantage   Rebuttal 1.)    All evidence in the fisheries advantage come from one single study 2.)    This study is in support of mineral accretion reefs to help fisheries 3.)    Thus the writer of those very lines disagrees that it is too late for ANY recovery, he has simply said that HALTING FISHING WOULD NOT BRING BACK ENOUGH FISH TO SAVE THE INDUSTY and other measure are neccesary 4.)    He then concludes in my solvency evidence that only mineral accretion coral reefs offer the solution to the problem which can help and revitalize the fishing industry and thus save millions of dollars   1.)    Even if this advantage is wrong, you have conceded the health advantages and the shoreline advantages are also still in play 2.)    Thus the plan should still happen given that the opponent’s argument is true, which it is not.        1.)    Yet again con has attempted to re-read the plan and ignore what is plainly clear but let me just use solvency evidence which cancels out con’s claim:     “Large-scale habitat restoration of degraded areas is now the only hope for recovery of the coastal fisheries, biodiversity, sand supplies, and shore protection that only large healthy reefs can provide. Unless the vast wastelands of degraded reefs are restored, all tropical coastal countries will soon face crippling economic losses. Unfortunately, at this time there is no serious funding for large-scale coral reef restoration”   “When considered as earnings per kilometer of reefs, the values for fisheries and for tourism typically ranged from several thousand dollars to several million dollars per kilometer of reef per year”   Thus please extend the fisheries argument     Tourism   1.)   Tourism is never mandated in the plan 2.)   Con must provide case specific evidence that tourism hurts Mineral Accretion Coral Reefs for it to be a real disadvantage  3.)   Con simply states that tourism can bring bad health but never states how bad of degradation this causes and thus there is not significance to his claim   Con has done literally nothing bad exaggerate, lie, and attempt to ruin the educational value of the round as far as I am concerned and it is shown clearly in his mannerism and clear disregard for the fairness of the round. I have effectively shown why con has been abusive, and why his claims are unfounded. He has yet to provide a solidly grounded argument and thus I can only see the round leaning my way right now. I pass the turn back to con for a hopefully educational round.</t>

    <t>The cons argument will flow as follows: Cost State protection Trade Case offense answers Hurts biodiversity   Cost The pro's claim that the demand by con to protect their case rather than amend it during a debate is invalid. As this is a policy debate, the entire point of this is to evaluate the Affirmative team plan to see if it is viable. These are not strict limitations by the con but rather a standard rule that is seen in policy debate. Were this something such as a Congressional debate, the pros actions of amendment would be perfectly fine; however, this is not the case. Pro then goes on to claim that the con is now fabricating prices. However, all the con did was replace the shortened amount of miles that the pro decided to use with the actual amount in the plan text. Therefore, the cons numbers is the only valid amount between the two sides. The pro came up with a new cost in this round, claiming that the final amount is 8.1 billion dollars, which still far exceeds their budget. To put this plainly, the USFG cannot create something that takes more resources than they give. The pros plan calls for a budget of 225 million dollars, the con has proven that the actual cost is significantly higher and pro, even when trying to cut the amount of land protected, still far exceeds their budget. Finally, addressing the breakwaters, pro has not proven that the cons definition is false. As the con has taken their own plan text and compared it to a definition, proving that these artificial reefs are technically breakwaters, con must assume the worst-case scenario and give the maximum cost estimate. State protection Pro refuses to answer the state protection as they claim that this is simply semantics. The con will reiterate that this is Policy debate. In this form of debate, we evaluate the pros plan, or policy. As their plan text explicitly defines the states to be evaluated, this plan is exposing states that the pros evidence shows are under threat from hurricanes. Trade Pro asked for proof that the ships would be running aground, the con will point to the Great Barrier Reef, a reef that has grown to be the largest of its kind in the world. These reefs obviously will present a danger to our shipping industry. As they grow to surround our nation, ships will hit them, causing massive amounts of environmental damage. Hurts biodiversity The pro claims that this will help the industries of fishing, tourism and coastal protection. However, the con will prove that the first two are short term at best (the coastal protection part is covered in State protection). Starting with fishing, the pros evidence on fisheries proves that the fishing industry destroys biodiversity. areas are too severely degraded to allow recovery of corals, fish, and invertebrates to former levels because the habitat quality is so badly degraded that reefs have lost most of their carrying capacity for these species. Even if every reef was strictly protected and all fishermen were eliminated today, the fisheries would still not be able to recover to former levels. There is no doubt that over-fishing has been disastrous almost everywhere (Pauly et al.,1998; 2000) This alone invalidates their solvency. Over-fishing has destroyed coral reefs. No matter how many we build, unless over fishing is addressed, artificial coral reefs will have to be rebuilt, as the marine life that usually inhabits them is dead or dying. Moving on to tourism, the con will reference material in the evidence below. Tourism may provide a small economic boost, however this will be short lived. As tourism hurts reefs in addition to overfishing, it may become difficult to keep them coming back when the reefs are skeletons from all the damage done by humans. Recreational activities also have a huge impact. For example, careless boating, diving, snorkeling, and fishing have substantially damaged coral reefs in many parts of the world, through people touching reefs, stirring up sediment, and dropping anchors. [Sic] The plan fails to address the dangers of human interaction with these reefs, so one must assume that the same dangers will apply. This means an increase in many factors including, but not limited to, seafood consumption, disturbing animals such as whales and sharks, and pollution. Therefore, this is not an advantage at all and flows con.</t>

    <t>The cons arguments will flow as follows. AnalyticsCostState protectionTrade disadvantageAnalyticsThe fact that the plan was premed does not excuse a lack of familiarity with the subject by the affirmative. The pro, in this debate, is expected to provide a plan and defend it. They may not claim that they copy-pasted this and therefore should receive leniency.CostFirst off is that the con will not let the changing of costs stand. Insofar that the plan defines a specific amount of coastline to protect and the pro may not simply amend their plan in the middle of the debate. This destroys educational value and makes it flat out impossible for the con to win when the pro may patch holes at will.The con will also observe that these new claims from the affirmative very much exceed the 225 million dollars that the plan originally allocates to this endeavour. Using this in tandem with the first cost argument, this raises the cost of the affirmatives plan using their equation to $7,968,666,800; something that is significantly greater than what was allocated in the funding and even claimed in the previous response by the pro.Moving onwards, the plan calls for artificial breakwaters.  'Coral reefs serve as an effective first line of defense to incoming waves, storms and rising seas,' said Dr. Michael Beck, lead marine scientist of The Nature Conservancy and a co-author of the study[sic]This is directly from the plan, falling under the definition of a breakwater.  breakwater: a wall that is built out into the sea to protect a harbor or beach from the force of waves. Therefore, as the DOI evidence does not explicitly limit the use of mineral accretion, the cons numbers of over 1 Trillion USD still stands. The pro tries to use Katrina as an example, claiming that over 100 billion dollars in damage is to be expected. From their evidence, the con recovered two lines that negate this.   -There were also engineering problems. Katrina was especially damaging because the levees designed to protect the below-sea-level city burst under the hurricane's 25-foot high storm surge. -Since 2005, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has spent $14.5 billion to improve New Orleans' system of levees, floodwalls, pump stations and surge barriers.Therefore, this is irrelevant as the USFG has already solved this issue Pouring money in to a fixed problem is a waste of money that the pro must justify under their plan text. State protectionThe pro is twisting the plan text instead of defending it. The verbatim text is as follows: -The plan will take place on all feasible costal states: (California, Louisiana, Texas, South Caronlina, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, New Jersey, and Maine) are all up for considerationThis explicitly defines the states to be considered, con arguments still stand.Trade disadvantage The pro has provided no evidence stating that this is not a real risk. In fact, all the pro side has done on this subjectis claim that the con is presenting false evidence without providing counter evidence. As the pro has the BoP, it is their duty in this debate to prove the validity of their case.However, the con will present two more examples of ship groundings on coral reefs .Summary The pro has failed to provide acceptable measures on cost, even changing their plan to come up with a cost that is well over their budget. In addition, Pro has not proven that the other states will be protected. Finally, Pro has not fulfilled their Burden of Proof to show that US naval trade is in no danger. As it stands, the United States of America stands to lose over a trillion dollars with billions more lost in trade.</t>

Doctors develop Cancer-curing drugs from Sea Sponges from Coral reefs:Caron 12:Stephanie Wear describes the reefs as the 'New York City' of the oceans, 'where everything is happening,' because it is 400 to 600 times more likely to find a source for a drug in the ocean than on land. But climate change threatens the sea life that house these healing properties. 'The coral reef population is diminished by about 80-90 percent across the Caribbean. scientists hope put out corals in order to battle some of the worst diseases known to humankind like: cancer, leukemia, AIDS Lupus, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's.

The proteins proved astonishingly potent, capable of blocking HIV at concentrations of a billionth of a gram by preventing the first step in HIV transmission, in which the virus must enter a type of immune cell known as the T-cell.'We found that cnidarians bind to the virus and prevent it from fusing with the T-cell membrane. d.

Mineral accretion coral reefs are extremely tough and are impervious to factors such as sea rise, making them the only option to solveGlobal Coral Alliance, Warming has caused significant reef mortality. oceans will continue to warm, and therefore rise, until world leaders recognize the long-term consequences of turning a blind eye to the problem. Governments have tried to address the problem by building sea walls out of concrete, steel, coral rubble or sand bags. But these materials soon rust, corrode, collapse and need to be rebuilt. In contrast only reefs made by mineral accretion can provide permanent, cost-effective protection capable of keeping pace with rising global sea levels. Mineral accretion coral reef growth rates, are about 3 to 5 times faster than normal coral reefs.Here are each card's websites in order. </t>

    <t>The flow of the debate will be as follows: Inherencies with the plan Analytics DA – Cost DA – Fails to protect states DA – Blocks ships   Analytics The affirmative fails to provide an agent of action, merely claiming that they will substantially increase investment in the use of mineral accretion. In addition, they fail to say who will enforce the execution of this project and the source of this funding. Without these three critical parts, the plan cannot move forward as there is no assignment to any department in the United States Federal Government to begin work on this plan. DA – Cost The median cost for building artificial breakwaters is USD $19,791 per meter, compared to $1,290 per meter for coral reef restoration projects. U.S. Department of the Interior 5/13/2014. The affirmative is using faulty calculations according to their own evidence. The con will break down the actual cost of construction according to the Affirmative’s evidence. The first step is the conversion of the miles that the plan calls for to meters. This results in a calculation of 49,515 miles being equal to 79,686,668 meters. After that the con multiplied the converted number by the cost per meter to achieve a final number of 1,577,078,846,338 or One Trillion –five hundred and seventy seven Billion – seventy eight million – eight hundred and forty six thousand – three hundred and thirty eight dollars. This is exponentially higher than the affirmatives claim of a mere 225 million dollars. 2014 The usfederalbudget.us site provides a relatively simple breakdown of the US budget which is 17,704.4 billion dollars or 17.704 trillion dollars. The actual cost of this plan is roughly 9 percent of the entire federal budget. The Con requires that the Affirmative fulfill their burden of proof in showing that the government can take this absolutely staggering blow. The Affirmative is charged with providing the source of this money as this cannot be ignored. Furthermore, let’s compare this cost to the Average cost per hurricane provided by the Affirmative. It would take slightly over 175 hurricanes that do 9 billion dollars in damage a piece to justify the cost of this enormous project. Atlantic Hurricane Season 2014 Kristen Rodman – May 18, 2014 With roughly 10 named tropical storms, five hurricanes and two major hurricanes predicted for the Atlantic Basin this season, AccuWeather.com's long-range forecasting team anticipates two storms, either tropical storms or hurricanes, to make landfall in the United States. With the 2014 year being so inactive and NOAA showing that there has been 60 hurricanes per 100 years, it will be over 200 years before this plan generates a net-profit. The Affirmative must justify this long term investment in the face of technological advances out dating their plan.   DA – Fails to protect states Mississippi, Alabama, Oregon, Washington, New York, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Delaware, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Hawaii. What do all of these states have in common? They’ve been hit by hurricanes and yet are not protected by the Affirmative plan. As the Affirmative failed to clarify the exclusion of these places, it must be assumed that they have been unintentionally left out and therefore will suffer the consequences of this ill written plan. DA – Blocks ships A U.S. Navy container ship remained stuck on a coral reef near Okinawa for a second day Friday.January 23, 2015 – Frances Burns Coral reefs block ship movement. Ships trying to cross them, as proven by my evidence, get grounded and are even damaged. Agricultural exports in 2013 amounted to 320 billion dollars and supported over one million jobs. This proves that Ocean trade is important historically, presently and in to the future. This plan would destroy US trade which, in 2000, shipped 736 billion dollars in that single year. Compared to the cost of the plan and the long term investment required to get anything out if it, it’s apparent that the economically destructive artificial coral reefs blocking shipping cannot be justified. In summary, the face value cost of the plan is staggering. That’s not even including billions of dollars in lost trade as ships cannot make it to other countries, being pinned in by the new reefs. Lastly, the plan fails to protect all states that are actually hit by hurricanes, bringing in to question as to states with major population centers such as New York are not covered. This plan requires elaboration and revision in order to give it a chance of consideration.</t>

<h>I thank my opponent for his arguments, and his speedy response. The framework was depicted thoroughly in the first round, so the framework for the second round will be skipped. I will attempt to address my opposition's short argument, for there are ten thousand characters. May I also point out my opponent has already conceded to a rise in temperature from 1979-1998. I will skip right to the debate.   ==Recent Land Temperatures==   I will start with a straightforward argument, one that is quite often set forward by the pro on this debate topic. To see if the global temperature really is rising, we must look at the big picture, not just data collected from the last ten years. The reason for this is because, as every intelligent scientist knows, the temperature on the Earth is quite unstable, and often affected by sunspots. When the solar activity ceases, periods known as 'maunder minimums' tend to occur. According to one Professor Lockwood, the sun's activity is falling off at a pace not seen in 10,000 years [1]. This happened around 1995-2000, which would explain why the Earth's temperature seems to be 'cooling,' as my opponent argued.    In fact, Drew T. Shindell found that these minimums in solar activity can shave 0.3-0.4 degrees Celsius off of Earth's overall temperature [2]. The study conducted by Shindell found that in the last Maunder Minimum (1600-1700, roughly,) temperatures were widely affected.   'Modeled global annual average surface temperatures were 0.34°C cooler in 1680 than in 1780 [2].'     [6] Since it has been established that the sudden 'stoppage' of global warming can be explained due to sunspots and minimal activity, we can now look at the temperature over the last 50 to 100 years. This is roughly when greenhouse gases skyrocketed, which is believed to be the main cause of global warming. I would also like to state that the graph my opponent set forward was obviously sawed, and came from a non-trustworthy source [3]. My opponent's graph showed two of the following things:   1) Temperature over a 15 year period   2) A slight (possible) temperature fall that can EASILY be accounted to the drop off in solar activity. Also, the graph itself shows the major temperature imbalance, with temperature imbalance reaching up to 1.10 degrees Fahrenheit during 2008, which is minor compared to the 1.30 degree imbalance in 1998.   Results from a much more trustworthy link, NASA, show that temperatures from 1880-2000 (before the drop-off in solar activity) steadily rose 0.8-1 degrees Celsius [4]. Not so coincidentally, methane and carbon dioxide have skyrocketed according to samples taken from both North and South Pole ice [4].   'Despite ups and downs from year to year, global average surface temperature is rising. By the beginning of the 21st century, Earth’s temperature was roughly 0.5 degrees Celsius above the long-term (1951–1980) average.' -Goddard Institute for Space Studies and NASA.  In this graph, we see a variety of different things. First, there is a high imbalance between temperatures. However, we can also observe that the Earth's mean surface temperature has inclined, though not necessarily in a straight line. The data shown by this graph depicts that the temperature of the Earth is rising at a steeper rate over time, which coincides with the increased Co2 emissions over the past decades [5]. It has been shown that the globe is warming (insofar) on land. This satisfies one of the definitions of global warming, which is that the globe is warming on land. As of now, part of the resolution is negated. On to the second part, which will be a rise in oceanic temperatures. ==Oceanic Temperatures== My opponent shows an increase in the polar ice caps (which, as I remind the audience, comes from a non-trustworthy link,) but does not show the size or temperature of any other part of the ocean. It seems like the opponent is focusing on little things that seem to go against global warming, so I will try to look at the big picture. For now, there are graphs explaining the sudden increase in Arctic Ice, such as the following [7]:  As the graph shows above, there has been a general warming across most of the worlds' oceans, which coincides with the atmospheric temperature. In response to the increase in Arctic Ice, we can see there is an isolated spot of cooling, but it is not generally a statistically significant trend. However, the Southern Atlantic Ocean has seen a two degree to a four degree increase in temperature (surface-wise.)Once again, we must look at the big picture. The possible increase in Arctic Ice (from August 2012 to August 2013) could be due to limited sun energy, an anomaly in unstable temperatures, etc. However, much like surface temperatures, the ice/temperature is very rocky, but it is clearly on a downward trend [8]. In fact, the data shows that there is a 3.2% decrease in ice per decade. What con also fails to show is the thickness of the ice, for an increase of thin ice does not necessarily coincide with lowering temperatures.Despite a rise in ice over the past two years, the oceans are undoubtedly hotter and the ice is still quite low. In the same year (2013) as the NASA satellite image was taken, the following statement was concluded:'October ice volume was around 20,000 cubic kilometers (approximately 4,800 cubic miles), meaning that ice volume in October 2013 still ranks among the lowest of the past 30 years.' -National Snow and Ice Data Center. To sum this rebuttal/argument up, we can see there is a small, normal spike around 2012-2013, and then a continuous downward trend from thereafter. In response to the Kevin Trenberth e-mail that my opponent pointed out, I would like to show what the E-mail actually said and meant.'Global warming is still happening - our planet is still accumulating heat. But our observation systems aren't able to comprehensively keep track of where all the energy is going. Consequently, we can't definitively explain why surface temperatures have gone down in the last few years. That's a travesty!' -Kevin Trenberth, ©2009.==Overview of Next Round==I will end this round here having satisfied the definition of 'global warming' and refuted my opponent's arguments. Of course, all of my evidence is very far from being stated. This was just an outline of what my case will look like. In the next round, I will go into further details concerning the following:-Changes in Migration-Animal Behavior-Hottest years on record-Density of Arctic Ice-Co2 Emissions-Glacial RetractionIn conclusion, all my opponent did was falsely state an E-mail and use biased evidence from a non-trustworthy link. He has also conceded that there was a period of warming, and stated a temperature WITHOUT evidence. I ask my opponent link me to his NASA Remote Sensing Systems that says there was an 0.36 degree Fahrenheit climb, because my graphs (which are must trustworthy) state an entirely different story.I thank my opponent for his time, and return the table to him. Good luck. </h>

    <t>==Framework==Before anything, I would like to address the opposition's arguments. He has copied and pasted (literally) in both of his arguments. He has cited where he got the information from, but he has not made any arguments of his own. Furthermore, I have refuted everything he stated from his first link, which shows he is using biased and unprofessional links to copy information from. I ask that he make his OWN arguments instead of just asking me to refute cold information from a website.The con side has not even refuted or responded to any of my arguments. I remind the reader that these points remain dropped by the con until such time as he is bold enough to actually refute them. Insofar, he has dropped the following four major points, all of which are vital to the resolution:-Surface temperatures are heating up-Hiatus in global warming is due to limited sun-Ocean temperatures are heating up-Increase in Arctic ice can be easily explainedHe has also dropped many other more minor points, but the above are the ones that are worth bringing up. Without further ado, I will refute my opponent's 'arguments' and discredit his source. Afterwhich, I will add more evidence to support that the globe is heating up. This should solidify the resolution to the point where I should be able to win the debate. Let's begin.==Global Temperatures are being Adjusted==My opponent states that global temperatures are being adjusted to show a warming trend. However, even while looking over his source, no strong scientific evidence supports this empty claim. He states that adjustments in temperatures were made by Goddard and the Institute for Space Studies, without any evidence, data, or a study shown. Since this seems like a disagreement between data sources as to what the temperature really is, I have found a graph showing what disagreement in temperature 'really' looks like [1]. As is shown, practically all of the major temperature recording studios agree on the temperature change. To state that each temperature station doctors their results in an almost unanimous faction without any evidence is clearly absurd, borderline insane. My opponent's article states that NOAA and NASA doctor their results significantly. However, JMA and MOHC seem to correlate with the findings, as well as almost all other temperature recording studios. In a review of over 10.5 thousand articles on global warming in 2013, it was found that only two of the articles questioned human involvement, and none presented an alternative theory [2]. It seems essentially irrefutable that scientists agree on almost all aspects of global warming. There is clearly no scandal here, and the Earth is clearly warming. I challenge my opponent to show me a graph from a highly trusted source that shows the global temperature going down instead of going up. Until such time, this point is refuted. ==Arctic Ice==Once again, the thickness of Arctic ice is mainly what matters, not the quantity, hence the saying 'quality is better than quantity.' Though Arctic ice could appear to be going up, the thickness and luster is on a downward trend not seen before [3]. The total volume of Arctic Sea ice was lowest between 2007 and 2008, as reported by Maslowski in 2010 (PDF.) People who argue that Arctic and Icelandic ice is going up are merely focusing on a thin, almost nonexistent, layer at the top. But what they fail to notice is that ice is going down at a significant rate.For good measure, I will post another graph explaining the lack of correlation regarding high temperatures and an increase in ice [4].It was found the increase in Antarctic Sea Ice was due to a number of factors, as argued by various sources:'One [factor] is the drop in ozone levels over Antarctica. The hole in the ozone layer above the South Pole has caused cooling in the stratosphere (Gillet 2003). This strengthens the cyclonic winds that circle the Antarctic continent (Thompson 2002). The wind pushes sea ice around, creating areas of open water known as polynyas. More polynyas lead to increased sea ice production (Turner 2009).'Henceforth, it is blatantly obvious that an increase in Arctic Sea ice does not necessarily correlate with lowering temperatures, for there are many things to take into account. However, it has been shown that volume of ice is coinciding with rising temperatures. To sum up, we can see the Arctic ice volume is lowering, sea temperatures are rising, sources can be trusted, and my opponents' source shows no evidence of its' preposterous claim. The resolution that Global Warming exists is, insofar, affirmed.==Animal Behavior==Even if, in some event, we could not trust the graphs, there is natural evidence to back up the fact that global warming exists and is happening. For example, animals are migrating, hibernating, and swimming earlier than usual. This is clearly visible through the behavior of the marmot. Their hibernation cycle is ending three weeks earlier due to rising temperatures [5][6]. In a study by Terry Root, published on journal, surprising results regarding animal behavior were found.'Out of the nearly 1,500 species examined, the researchers found that about 1,200 exhibited temperature-related changes consistent with what scientists would expect if they were being affected by global warming [7].'These changes have occurred in history, but no changes have been as rapid as the ones we are seeing today. In retrospect, the temperature change is the most rapid in history. It is clear as day that animal hibernation is being effected by rising temperatures due to global warming. Furthermore, there is a conspicuous change in the migration pattern of various birds and animals. These animals and birds are migrating further up north (where it is much colder) due to the rising temperatures across the globe [8].The migration of many animals, most notably the wild turkey, cannot be ignored in any stance. Since 1966, the turkey has migrated an additional 468 miles due northeast, all while the temperatures in the United States (avg. January) rose due to global warming. In addition to both hibernating and migrating, animals are nesting and hatching earlier (most specifically, birds.) This is due to warmer springs [9][10]. To solidify these claims of warming, we will look into the hottest years on record.==Hottest Years on Record==a. If global warming is happening, recent years should be the hottest on record.b. Recent years are the hottest on record.c. Global Warming is happening.This logic is backed up with findings from Climate Central [11.]Due to the fact that my opponent neglected to respond to any of my previous arguments, and copied and pasted information from a website, I will end my arguments for this round right here. I return the table to him and wish him luck. </t>

    <t>today I was on my favorite news website... the Drudge Report, if you don't know what that is it is an uncensored news website that tells the truth and inst being choked by the government. one of the headlines was 'PAPER: 'GLOBAL WARMING' BIGGEST SCIENCE SCANDAL EVER... '. I read the article, it stated that 'When future generations look back on the global-warming scare of the past 30 years, nothing will shock them more than the extent to which the official temperature records ' on which the entire panic ultimately rested ' were systematically 'adjusted' to show the Earth as having warmed much more than the actual data justified.' Homewood checked a swathe of other South American weather stations around the original three. In each case he found the same suspicious one-way 'adjustments'. First these were made by the US government's Global Historical Climate Network. They were then amplified by two of the main official surface records, the Goddard Institute for Space Studies and the National Climate Data Center, which use the warming trends to estimate temperatures across the vast regions of the Earth where no measurements are taken. Yet these are the very records on which scientists and politicians rely for their belief in 'global warming'.Homewood has now turned his attention to the weather stations across much of the Arctic, between Canada (51 degrees W) and the heart of Siberia (87 degrees E). Again, in nearly every case, the same one-way adjustments have been made, to show warming up to 1 degree C or more higher than was indicated by the data that was actually recorded. This has surprised no one more than Traust Jonsson, who was long in charge of climate research for the Iceland met office (and with whom Homewood has been in touch). Jonsson was amazed to see how the new version completely 'disappears' Iceland's 'sea ice years' around 1970, when a period of extreme cooling almost devastated his country's economy. One of the first examples of these 'adjustments' was exposed in 2007 by the statistician Steve McIntyre, when he discovered a paper published in 1987 by James Hansen, the scientist (later turned fanatical climate activist) who for many years ran Giss. Hansen's original graph showed temperatures in the Arctic as having been much higher around 1940 than at any time since. But as Homewood reveals in his blog post, 'Temperature adjustments transform Arctic history', Giss has turned this upside down. Arctic temperatures from that time have been lowered so much that that they are now dwarfed by those of the past 20 years.Homewood's interest in the Arctic is partly because the 'vanishing' of its polar ice (and the polar bears) has become such a poster-child for those trying to persuade us that we are threatened by runaway warming. But he chose that particular stretch of the Arctic because it is where ice is affected by warmer water brought in by cyclical shifts in a major Atlantic current ' this last peaked at just the time 75 years ago when Arctic ice retreated even further than it has done recently. The ice-melt is not caused by rising global temperatures at all. Of much more serious significance, however, is the way this wholesale manipulation of the official temperature record ' for reasons GHCN and Giss have never plausibly explained ' has become the real elephant in the room of the greatest and most costly scare the world has known. This really does begin to look like one of the greatest scientific scandals of all time. this proves my point by using factual evidence provided by this article.</t>

    <t>my opponent seems to be getting mad for no reason... like a typical american citizen that believes everything the government tells them... How have we come to be told that global temperatures have suddenly taken a great leap upwards to their highest level in 1,000 years? In fact, it has been no greater than their upward leaps between 1860 and 1880, and 1910 and 1940, as part of that gradual natural warming since the world emerged from its centuries-long 'Little Ice Age' around 200 years ago.This belief has rested entirely on five official data records. Three of these are based on measurements taken on the Earth's surface, versions of which are then compiled by Giss, by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and by the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit working with the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction, part of the UK Met Office. The other two records are derived from measurements made by satellites, and then compiled by Remote Sensing Systems in California and the University of Alabama, Huntsville. One of the more provocative points arising from the debate over those claims that 2014 was 'the hottest year evah' came from the Canadian academic Dr Timothy Ball when, in a recent post on WUWT, he used the evidence of ice-core data to argue that the Earth's recent temperatures rank in the lowest 3 per cent of all those recorded since the end of the last ice age, 10,000 years ago. In reality, the implications of such distortions of the data go much further than just representing one of the most bizarre aberrations in the history of science. The fact that our politicians have fallen for all this scary chicanery has given Britain the most suicidally crazy energy policy (useless windmills and all) of any country in the world.</t>

    <t>I accept this debate under the following resolution, which has been taken from instances where the opposition has said that global warming is a scam:'Global Warming is Legitimate.' To clarify, I am NOT debating whether global warming isgood or bad for the Earth. Switching this resolution mid-debate should be seen as an automatic loss, for my opponent was somewhat straightforward about his suggested resolution by saying '[Is] global warming fake or real?' I ask that my opponent stick to this resolution, and only this resolution, so we can keep the debate on track.I also ask that my opponent back up his evidence with sources. This is because debates like this can easily lead to personal opinions and insults, throwing the debate astray. I also ask, if this is not too much, for my opponent to use proper grammar and formatting so I can refute and debate in a cleaner and easier manner. Since this is a five round debate, I believe this is essential to the quality of the debate.I will now present the definitions to be used in this debate.

    <t>According to NASA's own data via Remote Sensing Systems , the world has warmed a mere .36 degrees Fahrenheit over the last 35 years (they started measuring the data in 1979) however, that does mean the world is warmer, right? The problem with that argument is that we experienced the bulk of that warming between 1979 and 1998 . . . since then, we've actually had temperatures dropping. as a matter of a fact the north polar ice cap is increasing in size. In recent satellite images from NASA there is at least a 43% increase in size.Leaked emails from global warming scientists state that the Earth is not warming, such as this one from Kevin Trenberth that states, 'The fact is that we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty we can't.'It is becoming harder and harder for the global warming community to ignore some of the scientific data that show the Earth is not getting warmer . . . instead, the world is getting cooler.</t>

    <t>Greetings. The arguments you are presenting are common among the left side of the political spectrum over the issue of Global Warming/Climate Change. The negation of this debate will now provide eight points as to why the public has been mislead over the complexities of this issue:  1. The 20th century warming of 1-1.4'F is within the +/- 5'F range of the past 3,000 years. A 2003 study by researchers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics shows temperatures from 1000-1100 AD (before fossil fuel use) that are comparable to those from 1900-1990.  2. Rising CO2 levels are a result of global warming, not a cause of it. As temperatures increase, CO2 is released from 'carbon sinks' such as the oceans or the Arctic tundra. Measurements of ice core samples show that over the last four climactic cycles (past 240,000 years) periods of global warming preceded global increases in CO2.  3. Human releases of CO2 cannot cause climate change as any increases in CO2 are eventually balanced by nature. CO2 gets absorbed by oceans, forests, and other 'carbon sinks' that increase their biological activity to absorb excess CO2 from the atmosphere. 50% of the CO2 released by the burning of fossil fuels and other human activities, has already been absorbed.  4. Global warming and cooling are caused by fluctuations in the sun's heat (solar forcing), not by the minor greenhouse effect of human-produced gases such as CO2 and methane. Between 1900 and 2000 solar irradiance increased .19%. This increase correlates with the rise in surface temperatures in the US.  5. Due to the inherent unpredictability of climate systems it is impossible to accurately use models to determine future weather. Climate models have been unable to simulate major known features of past climate such as the ice ages or the very warm climates of the Miocene, Eocene, and Cretaceous periods. If models cannot replicate past climate changes they should not be trusted to predict future climate changes.  6. Rising temperatures are caused primarily by water vapor, the most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, not by CO2. Water vapor concentrations in the atmosphere are driven by natural storm systems and ocean currents. According to a Mar. 5, 2010 study by researchers at NOAA, water vapor in the stratosphere was responsible for increasing the rate of warming during the 1990s by 30%.  7. The increased hurricane activity over the past decade (1995-2005), including hurricane Katrina, is not the result of human-induced climate change; it is the result of cyclical tropical cyclone patterns, driven primarily by natural ocean currents, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) testimony in the US Senate on Sep. 20, 2005.  8. Deep ocean currents cause climate warming and cooling in long term cycles. The minor greenhouse effect of human produced CO2 pales in comparison. Global cooling from 1940 to the 1970s, and warming from the 1970s to 2008, coincided with fluctuations in ocean currents and cloud cover driven by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) - a naturally occurring rearrangement in atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns.</t>

    <t>Let it be known that the affirmation side in this debate failed to refute any of my eight critical points that I made during the first round of the debate:  But anyway, my opponent brings up data claiming the fact that the Earth is currently warmer than it was a BILLION years ago. Considering that in the last billion years, multicellular life began, multicellular life left the seas and came upon land, the dinosaurs lived and died, and we net through two ice ages, using that range for data does not get any point whatsoever across.  Humans have adapted and lived through about 500 centuries of varying climates and animals surrounding us. Global warming and cooling has occurred at periodic levels throughout the history of planet Earth. We adapted then, and this was far before the massive technological achievement that mankind has attained in recent history. When nature tries to hit us, we hit back harder.  My opponent also fails to provide any evidence of climate change affecting the ownership and operation of modern business and how exactly the warming of the globe will affect these corporate institutions. The opponent also cites an increase of tsunamis due to warming temperatures, but this is simply impossible, considering that a tsunami is formed by a geological event and not one of climatical origins.  I urge a negative vote in this debate.</t>

This is not the end of the world, yet we had brought ourselves to the edge of death in a highly disrespectful manner. The Greenland Ice Core Project (GRIP) studies and researches found that ice cores are able to provide the scientists with multiple informations regarding the climate change. The drilling of the ice and the analyzation from the dust and air bubbles contained in the atmospheric gases provide the scientists the temperature record in which will be graphed for future studies and response. This evidence proves how our climate changes and how the temperature on earth is getting warmer compared to billion years ago.</t>

<h>Global Warming has been highly exaggerated. If you understand climate you should realize there are much more aspects to our atmosphere than CO2 caused by humans . CO2 caused by humans make up less than 4 percent of the C02 in our atmosphere yet politicians believe that we are to blame and that we must try to save the planet through some sort of carbon tax which while magically make the climate change. The simple facts are that CO2 is a RESULT of temperature changes NOT a cause. The climate graphs prove this. There is a 100 year gap in some places between temperatures rises and then the proceeding CO2 rises. The facts are that the majority of CO2 comes from the ocean. When the ocean temperatures rise more CO2 comes off the ocean. Global warming alarmist simply don't take into account the fact that natural causes have produced temperatures to be much higher than they were today and CO2 levels where radically higher thousands of years ago before humans had any impact on the planet. Im not saying the greenhouse effect doesn;t happen or that humans don't have any effect on the climate, what im suggesting is that after a 16 year 'pause' in temperature increases yet human CO2 has gone up greatly in the last decade leads me to believe there is much more to go into the climate change than humans driving SUV and the climate is much more complicated than politicians say it is.

    <t>I accept this challenge and note that I'll be playing devil's advocate for a challenge. Let's start this off lightly with one argument:If global warming does not occur, then why has the rate of CO2 rose so fastly, out of the ordinary, completely unaffected by climate changes? If you look at the graph below, there is an exponential humongous rise in CO2 ever since the Industrial Revolution. Even looking at the bigger picture, with the previous patterns of CO2 rising and falling, this new rise is very irregular. My opponent has failed ot use any sources to support his mere assertions. He did not use any evidence to support how 'temperature does not change' due to global warming. The temperature rise is very unnatural. And then, to go back and compare the temperature since the industrial revolution to before the industrial revolution. As you can see industry (made by man) is a huge contribution to global warming, and polluting of CO2. It is definitely a problem, and definitely not a waste of our time or money. We need to fix this irregularity as soon as possible.I now rest my case, and give the floor to my opponent.</t>

<h>Thank you Con for starting this debate. I hope to have an interesting and civil dialogue with you. Introduction At first I was unsure if I wanted to take part in this debate. This is because the word 'better' was not clearly defined. By better one could mean that an omnivore diet has tastier food, is more convenient, and for that reason it should be considered 'better.' However, I'm going to interpret the word better to mean that a vegan lifestyle is superior to an omnivore one for various reasons. With that said, let me begin.Definition of veganism according to the Vegan Society: Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose. [1]Veganism is Kinder Towards Animals This, I think, is pretty obvious. In order for animal products to be produced, animals must be exploited. In modern animal agriculture we confine animals for their entire lives and make them miserable. They are denied proper veterinary care, free space to move around and exercise, appropriate social interaction with members of their species, and anesthesia during the process of castration and other mutilations. Once these animals reach market weight, they are sent to a slaughterhouse where they are hung upside down and have their throat slit. In 2013, a USDA inspector at a chicken slaughterhouse pointed out that: '[Workers] are literally throwing the birds into the shackles, often breaking their legs as they do it... They are working so fast, they sometimes get just one leg in the shackles. When that happens, the chickens aren't hanging right... They don't get killed, and they go into the scald tank alive.' [2]In 'Modern Meat: A Brutal Harvest,' a 2001 article from the Washington Post, a worker at a slaughterhouse for cattle describes the disturbing reality of insufficient stunning: 'It takes 25 minutes to turn a live steer into steak at the modern slaughterhouse where Ramon Moreno works. For 20 years, his post was ‘second-legger,’ a job that entails cutting hocks off carcasses as they whirl past at a rate of 309 an hour.  'The cattle were supposed to be dead before they got to Moreno. But too often they weren’t.  'They blink. They make noises,’ he said softly. ‘The head moves, the eyes are wide and looking around.’  'Still Moreno would cut. On bad days, he says, dozens of animals reached his station clearly alive and conscious. Some would survive as far as the tail cutter, the belly ripper, the hide puller.  'They die,’ said Moreno, ‘piece by piece.’ [3]To help put what I have said into perspective, I will link a short documentary by Mercy For Animals that demonstrates some of the things I have been talking about: https://www.youtube.com...Viewing animals as commodities for us to use for our pleasure and convenience is inhumane and disrespectful. If we think it's morally wrong to ignore the suffering of human beings, then we should also think it's morally wrong to ignore the suffering of nonhuman animals that we use for food. Veganism is Better For The Environment Animal production is a major contributor to climate change. In November of 2006 the United Nations came out with a report called ' Livestock's Long Shadow' where they explained that animal production was a bigger contributor to climate change than all of the Earth's cars, trucks, buses, airplanes, and trains combined. The ICPP, which is an intergovernmental panel on climate change, has also said:'Please eat less meat -- meat is a very carbon intensive commodity... this is something that the IPCC was afraid to say earlier, but now we have said it.' [4] According to a study in the UK, dropping meat, dairy and eggs from your diet saves 50% more carbon emissions than driving a Prius. This study showed that an average 2,000 kcal high-meat diet has 2.5 times as many greenhouse gas emissions as an average vegan diet. [5] The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has also said that raising animals for food--including land used for grazing and land used to grow feed crops for farmed animals--now uses a staggering 30% of the Earth's land mass. According to Greenpeace, nearly 80% of land deforested in the Amazon is now used as cattle pasture. [6] Veganism is A Superior Alternative To Fighting World Hunger In the U.S. we feed more than 70% of grain and soybeans to animals, [7] and in doing so we waste most of the food value of the grains that we're feeding them. If all the grain currently fed to livestock in the United States were consumed directly by people, the number of people who could be fed would be nearly 800 million. [8] Depending on the species, the animals may return to us somewhere between 1/10th and 1/3rd of the food value of the grains and soybeans that we put into them. So we are just wasting huge amounts of food in order to produce the large amount of animal products. It would be better and more practical if we fed our grains and soybeans to people, instead of feeding them to billions of land animals. One acre of land can yield 30,000 pounds of carrots, 40,000 pounds of potatoes or 50,000 pounds of tomatoes. However, one acre of land can yield only 250 pounds of meat, which means that a meat, dairy and egg diet is an unsuccessful way to combat world hunger, and that a vegan diet is a superior alternative. This is why Food For Life Global, the world's largest feed the hungry organization, only serves plant based food. As well as Everybody Gets Fed, Earth Save and Plenty. A Well Planned Vegan Diet is Healthy According to the American Dietetic Association, America's largest organization of health care professions:  'appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.' [9]Conclusion If we take animal welfare, the environment and world hunger into account, and ask ourselves which lifestyle is most beneficial, it seems like a vegan lifestyle is the better choice. In this paper I have provided various reasons for thinking that, and so I believe we are committed to the idea that veganism is superior. The resolution is upheld.Sources in comments</h>

This is why Food For Life Global, the world's largest feed the hungry organization, only serves plant based food. As well as Everybody Gets Fed, Earth Save and Plenty. A Well Planned Vegan Diet is Healthy According to the American Dietetic Association, America's largest organization of health care professions:  'appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.' [9]Conclusion If we take animal welfare, the environment and world hunger into account, and ask ourselves which lifestyle is most beneficial, it seems like a vegan lifestyle is the better choice. In this paper I have provided various reasons for thinking that, and so I believe we are committed to the idea that veganism is superior. The resolution is upheld.Sources in comments</t>

    <t>Thank you Con for your opening statements.Introduction Firstly, I will begin by responding to my opponent's arguments for why a meat diet is better. Secondly, I will defend my original arguments for why veganism is better than a meat eating lifestyle.  Nature Here Con argues that humans are meant to eat meat because we have molars and K-9 teeth. This is more of a statement of fact rather than an argument for why a meat lifestyle is better than a vegan one. I really don't even have to respond to it for that reason. However, I will do so anyways. Yes, humans can eat meat but that doesn't mean that we ought to. I could go next door and eat my neighbor's newborn. His baby is, after all, made of meat like animals. However, I think we would all agree that just because I CAN do that doesn't mean that I should.  Food Chain Here Con argues that eating animals is morally permissible because animals in the wilderness eat other animals. This too, is not an argument for why a meat diet is better than a vegan one. However, I will respond to it anyway. Yes, animals in the wild eat other animals, but this is more of a statement of fact rather than an argument. It seems like you're saying that because animals do that, it must be morally permissible for humans to do so as well. This is seriously problematic, because if we start to derive our moral values from what other animals do, then many things can no longer be consider immoral. Rape, infanticide, aggressive fights, ect. are all things that occur in the animal kingdom. Do we really want to say that because other animals do these things that we ourselves should be allowed to do them as well? I think not. Nutrition Here Con argues that meat is superior to plants when it comes to getting protein. He didn't exactly explain how it's superior. So for now, I will dismiss his claim. Taste Here Con argues that meat is one of the tastiest parts of the meal. This, I think, is kind of subjective. There are many people who do not like the taste of meat, and who prefer other foods. Con mistakenly thinks that all vegans eat is vegetables. This is untrue, because pretty much every food can be made vegan. Even things like meat. Whole grains, beans, nuts, seeds, pasta, pizza, lentils, tofu, tempeh, seitan, ect. are just a few of the many foods out there for people abstaining from animal products.  The Individual or Society?Con says that my arguments are simply stating that a vegan society is better, and that it is not addressing the individual person. And therefore my arguments are not even relevant to the debate. The individual and society distinction was not made clear in the rules of the debate. It was NOT, 'A Vegan lifestyle is better than a meat-eating one for the individual,' or 'A Vegan lifestyle is better than a meat-eating one for society.' The debate topic was simply, 'A Vegan lifestyle is better than a meat-eating one.' I think Con is trying to conveniently make this distinction in the middle of the debate to make it easier for himself. However, even if I were to grant this distinction, veganism can still be shown to be better. While it's true that one person switching to a vegan diet isn't going to stop the meat industry, it does save nearly 200 animals per year [1] from the miserable existence on a modern farm. As I pointed out earlier, according to a study in the UK, dropping animal products from your diet saves 50% more carbon emissions than driving a Prius. So even if we ignore the society part of it, and instead look at it from the individual's perspective, veganism is still better. Veganism is Kinder Towards Animals Here Con argues that the animals we raise on farms are meant to be food. This is again, more of a statement of fact rather than an argument. Of course those animals are there to be killed for our food. That's why we continue to breed them on a massive scale. However, what's the moral justification for us doing this to animals? I don't see it. This statement made by Con could have also been used by a white slave owner in the 18th century. To demonstrate this, let change the word animals with Africans, and the phrase 'to be food' with 'to pick cotton.' Observe:  'The Africans we have on plantations are meant to pick cotton, would you all rather go back to picking your own cotton?'I believe Alice Walker said it best with her quote:'The animals of the world exist for their own reasons. They were not made for humans any more than black people were made for white, or women created for men.' [2]Con says that it's more mean to not buy animal flesh at the store, because by doing that the animal has died for nothing. This line of reasoning is baffling. The animal whose flesh is being sold has already died for nothing, given that we don't even need to eat meat. By purchasing that flesh you are not doing the animals a favor. All you're doing is contributing to the continued existence, prosperity, and slaughter of more animals. Veganism is Better For The Environment I already explained how vegans individually do help the environment by saving more carbon emissions, and not producing huge amounts of greenhouse gas emissions like meat eaters.  Conclusion Con has literally given no reasons to believe that an omnivore lifestyle is better than a vegan one. I, on the other hand, have given various reasons for thinking that a vegan lifestyle is best.  </t>

    <t>My apologies, I guess 'better' was too vague. Thanks for accepting the debate in-spite of that. I hope this will be a very fun debate.  Opening ================ I believe that an omnivore life-style is more beneficial than a vegan life-style. I hear many people say this, and I have a very strong belief on the Con side. I will provide arguments and rebut my opponent's to further support my point.  Arguments ================ 1. Nature A lot of people say that eating animals is wrong and immoral, this is incorrect. Herbivores have molars to easily chew vegetables, and carnivores have K-9 teeth (the pointy teeth, for those of you who don't know what that means) to help tear meat. Us humans, have them both. Why? Because we were meant to eat meat AND vegetables, not one or the other. This is nothing new to Earth and other animals share this trait, which leads me to my next argument.  2. Food Chain Again, people say that eating animals is immoral and wrong. I have an example of where it's perfectly ok; the wilderness. Animals eat other animals all the time. In fact, some animals only eat OTHER animals (carnivores). So humans eating meat is nothing new to nature.  3. Nutrition While a vegan diet has a slightly better nutritional value, a meat eating easily gives you protein. Yes, there are ways to get protein in vegan diets, but meat is superior when it comes to protein. If you have any desire to exercise and work out, you know that you can recover faster if you consume protein afterwards. Protein builds muscle. Athletes also eat meat, sure, it's controlled, but they still eat it. According to source [1] 'A 100 gram portion (3.5 ounces) of raw ground beef contains large amounts of Vitamin B12, B3 (Niacin), B6, Iron, Zinc, Selenium and plenty of other vitamins and minerals,' obviously meat has a lot of nutritional value  4. Taste Let's face it, meat is one of the tastiest part of the meal. Vegetables and fruits can't really live up to meat's taste. Wouldn't people like to eat something that taste good? If you had to only eat vegetables, meal time wouldn't be so good. Yes, there are some tricks to make vegetables taste better, but meat tops it all. First of all, I would like to say one argument here. Most of Pro's arguments are arguing that a vegan SOCIETY is better. We are talking about the individual here. If one were to switch to a vegan diet it wouldn't stop the meat industry. All the arguments about 'Veganism is better for the environment' or 'Veganism is a Superior Alternative To Fighting World Hunger' are not relevant to this debate. One person isn't going to stop the meat industry, so most of Pro's arguments are useless.  1. Veganism is kinder toward animals Okay, here we go. This sounds a bit mean, but it's true. The animals we raise in farms or in plantations are meant to be food, would you all rather of back to hunting for food? We may not have a successful hunt and we may starve. Sure, if you eat vegan you aren't eating the animals, but the animals is still on the shelf, useless. Isn't it meaner if you just leave the sacrifice of an animal un-used? That means that the animal died for nothing, and the meat will just rot and become useless. Sounds mean.  2. Veganism is better for the environment Again, one person isn't going to miraculously stop the meat industry. There will still be animals production. This argument doesn't explains why it's better for the individual to switch to a vegan diet.  3. Veganism is a superior alternative to fight world hunger There will still be livestock... One person isn't going to change it.  4. A well planned vegan diet is healthy While yes, vegetables are healthy for you. However, if you aren't a vegan you still eat vegetables and fruits, so you will get the nutrients you need from those foods. The only difference is that you have good tasting food and a great source of protein with an omnivore diet. </t>

<h>Thank you Con for presenting your arguments.    Con stated in the rules at the beginning of the debate that I will not be allowed to argue in round 5. For that reason, this will be my last round to post arguments for this debate.NatureCon says that if I'm going to claim that eating animals is morally wrong, I need to provide a reason for why that is the case. In my first round of arguments of this debate, I said that it's morally wrong because it involves animal exploitation. These animals are forced to live a life full of pain and suffering. Not only that, but they are also killed prematurely at the slaughterhouse. Now, one may ask, why is it wrong to inflict pain on sentient animals? I would say it's wrong because pain is a sensation whose absence is intrinsically desired. Why is it wrong to kill sentient animals prematurely? It's wrong because it deprives them of a valuable future it could have, and thwarts the current desires they have like desires for food, sex, and being outside on a warm day. Con says that our ancestors ate meat for a long time, and that they needed to do so for survival. This is more of a statement of fact rather than an argument. However, it seems like Con is saying that because our ancestors ate meat for a long time, it is therefore morally justified. This line of argument is a fallacy, because it's an appeal to tradition. In the U.S., owning African Americans as slaves used to be a tradition. But does that mean owning other human beings was justified? No, clearly not. In the same way, just because we have been eating animals for a long time does not mean that we should continue to do so. Nutrition It's true that meat provides vitamin B12, and that this nutrient is of extreme importance. However, vegans can obtain vitamin B12 from taking a supplement or eating foods fortified with it. So meat eaters don't actually have an advantage here when it comes to B12. Con may object that if vegans have to supplement or eat foods fortified with this nutrient, this means that a vegan diet is unnatural. However, this argument would be an appeal to nature fallacy. Just because something is natural or unnatural does not mean it's good or bad. Many of the things we do nowadays could be considered unnatural. Driving a car, flying in an airplane, using a cell phone, debating others online, ect. could all be considered unnatural. As registered dietitians Jack Norris and Virginia Messina point out in their book 'Vegan for Life.''Today's commercial plant foods and meat are different from the foods available in prehistoric times. We eat hybrids of plants and we feed foods to animals that they would not normally eat. Additionally, the U.S. food supply is routinely fortified with a host of vitamins and minerals. Even those people who strive to eat a more 'natural' diet as adults have normally benefited from fortified foods as children. It is quite unlikely that anyone is eating a natural diet in today's world.' [1] I'm still not convinced that meat is a superior source of protein. Meat has cholesterol, saturated fat, and no fiber in it. However, a cup of cooked lentils has 18 grams of protein, fiber, no cholesterol, and is under 1 gram of fat. [2]Veganism is Kinder Towards Animals Con says we were designed to be omnivores since the beginning. It's true that human beings are omnivores, however, we are not obligate omnivores. We can be healthy without eating animal products. They are not necessary for good nutrition. Veganism is Better For The Environment Con asked me how animals produce more greenhouse gases than all of transport. To put it simply, the world's 1.5 billion cows and billions of other grazing animals emit dozens of polluting gases, including lots of methane. [3] Methane is produced by farting and belching cows. So, since we raise huge amounts of animals for food each year, and each of them produces polluting gases, it's not hard to see how they would produce more than transport. In sum, a lot of animals, a lot of polluting gases, equals serious problems for the environment. Conclusion Overall,  I think I have shown how a vegan lifestyle is better than a meat eating one. It's better for the animals, will provide more food for hungry people, and is better for the environment. This would all be true even from the perspective of the individual instead of society. Finally, thank you Con for a enjoyable debate.</h>

    <t>Thanks for the debate, Pro. 1. Nature It seems that Pro is linking animals to slaves. This is not a good comparison, and this is why. Animals are treated with RESPECT. Crazy, right? After all, the big manufacturers treat the animals poorly. Ask any farmer who is not part of a big manufacturer and they would say they care for their animals, even though they are to be killed anyway. Even some farmers who are part of large manufacturers love their animals, and they think they shouldn't be treated like so, some even quit because of this. Animals are still LOVED, they are not viewed as 'mere commodities'. Second, food. Did we need slaves to survive? No, it was just a way to be lazy. Animals can be FOOD, it isn't bad for you and it certainly has nutritional value. We ate it for SURVIVAL, slaves were used just for making things easier, and they weren't treated with respect. Yes, there could be improvements to the current system, but how does this benefit the individual? It doesn't, it doesn't.  2. Nutrition Pro forgets one key aspect. Pro keeps arguing how eating vegetables and fruits is healthy, we need to remember that having a omnivore diet means eating vegetables and fruits too. As I explained in round 4, you get all the nutritional value of fruits and vegetables, and get all the benefits from eating meat as well. Why trouble yourself into trying to find a source of protein and all the nutritional things in meat in a vegan diet, if you could just change to a healthier omnivore diet( (eating more fruits and vegetables)?  3. Veganisim is Better for the environment Do we need electronics to survive? Do we really need online debate sites? Do we need big cities or schools to survive? No, they aren't necessary, but they are EXTREMELY beneficial. We could live without all these things, it's possible, but it's better if we do have them. Same thing goes with meat, we don't need meat, but it is extremely beneficial. Remember, you will still be eating vegetables and fruits, and you will benefit from meat too.  4. Veganisim is better for the environment So, if we let ALL of them free, will that help? At least in farms they get food, and their waste gets cleaned up. Imagine how bad it would be if we let them free. A lot of natural resources would be depleted, there would be overcrowding due to the mass amount of animals., and there will be a lot of gases being thrown into the atmosphere. In fact, there might be even MORE, because there's no one to clean it up. All in all, it would be more disastrous for everyone if we just let all of them free.  Conclusion: I stand firmly on the position that an omnivore diet is better than a vegan one for the individual. You get all the nutrition from fruits and vegetables, AND you get the added bonus from the meat (Not to mention having one of the tastiest parts of the meal). It is just better and more nutritious (that's vague, but that's all I can think of). I believe I have successfully countered my opponents arguments, and that my arguments stay standing.  Thank you for the amazing debate Pro. Thanks to all the voters who vote, and I hope you vote Con.</t>

    <t>Thank you for extending and understanding, Pro  Rebuttals: 1. Defending my clarification When I created this debate, I intended for the debate to focus on the individual. I thought the topic title would speak for itself. Lifestyle relates to an individual's choices in life, or how the state of their life is. What I believe Pro is trying to say is that a vegan community is better than a meat-eating one, which is not what the title is. Therefore, I still stand by my clarification, as it was originally intended for this debate.  2. Nature This was originally intended to be a rebuttal. If it is truly morally wrong to eat animals, give me a reason why it is. I strongly believe that it is NOT morally wrong to eat animals. Our ancestors have been doing it for a long time, and it was necessary for human SURVIVAL back then, and it still is. Pro has not given a reason WHY it's morally wrong to eat animals.  3. Food Chain This was originally intended to be a rebuttal. Have we had any problems eating animals? Any health problems? We have been eating meat for a long time. Tell me Pro, why is it wrong to eat animals? After all, we have been doing it for a long time.  4. Nutrition I will give some reasons why an omnivore diet is nutritional. First, we need to see that an omnivore diet STILL INCLUDES VEGETABLES AND FRUITS. We aren't totally dismissing vegetables and fruits in an omnivore diet, that would be a carnivore. So omnivores will get the nutrition from vegetables and fruits, along with the nutrition of meat. Here are some reasons why meat provides nutritional value. [1] Meat provides vitamin B12, which is a vital vitamin. Studies show that 92% of vegans are severely lacking in this vital nutrients. Pro asks how meat is superior in protein. Meat contains a lot of amino acids, which builds muscle. Studies show that people with omnivore diets have more muscle then vegans. It also increases your bone density at an old age and reduces risk of fractures. WITH the added value form vegetables and fruit, we can see that the omnivore diet is better.  5. Veganisim is kinder toward animals Unlike humans, those are animals. We didn't eat the slaves, we didn't even need them for survival. Our ancestors didn't used slaves, it's something government gave birth to. All of the animals (including us) have basically a couple basic needs. Find FOOD and drink, Sleep, Reproduce. It's just that us humans are a lot more advanced than animals, but we all still share the same basic needs. All animals need to find food, meat or not, and we were designed to be omnivores since the beginning.  6. Veganisim is Better For The Environment. How does it produce more greenhouse gases than airplanes, automobiles, and trains combined? Pro claims that it produces more greenhouse gases, but how? How does it? Pro does not explain this argument well. All that pasture land would probably be used as farms, which as we know, without proper farming techniques, the land will be derived from it's nutrients and it will unable to yield crop, which results in more forest land being cut down for farms.</t>

<h>Enviomentalism is a religion not climate change. We do not have to live eternally to see the effects of global warming. Of course we can not predict the outcome of the global warming other than we know it has happened frequently in the past. The climate has a cycle where ice age is the last stage (or the first depending on how you put it). Global warming follows the average temperature of the earth. This does not mean that all over the world it will get hotter. Global warming does not only result in warmer temperatures, but also in more violent storms, more violent earthquakes etc. We can prove climate change by just looking at pictures of glaciers now and 50 years ago.</h>

    <t>What does subways have to do with climate change? Even though the idea of subways was to allow freedom of movement at all times, it is still a idea or vision for the subway and that does not mean it works in practice.  Putting the subways aside; no it is not always that the weather forecasts are exact, but they are very often right. When we see a weather forecast, you are right that they are not 100% right, but there is a good reason for that. When you have to forecast the weather, you look at the different pressures in the different areas and thereby predicting e.g. a storms movement a behaviour. So when you see a weather forecast, it is 100% right if nothing in the pressure changed since it was made.  Climate change and weather forecast are scientifically proved. Since we can measure the amount of carbon-dioxide in the atmosphere which is 0.06%, while it was 0.05% 50 years ago. That's an increase on 20% which is obvious with the boom in the oil industry.</t>

    <t>What? I can't hear you.</t>
<h>Sorry for late delivery of this argument: I flew to New York to visit family during Christmas.  To correct my opponents reasoning, 'humans' advanced thinking does not benefit the common good.' Whether humans' ability to think clearly and rationally is objectively great, there is no 'common good' when it comes to inter-species contact. If you have ever watched the PBS program 'Nature', you know that it is usually a zero-sum game when it comes to survival. Our skills are good for US and that is what matters. My opponent also said, 'the Earth will crumble to global warming in a couple decades', which is completely null and void because global warming is a natural phenomenon that has been occurring since the end of the last ice age 14,000 years ago. I will not debate whether global warming is a real threat (or as real as eco-freaks make it out to be), nor if it is humans' fault- that is not the purpose of this debate (however, for the record, human beings are innocent in the climate change theory). My opponent then went further, 'we single handedly destroyed billions of years of progress to produce life forms as they are today'. Now, the term 'progress' was used very, very loosely here. Progress as in 'the evolution and random turn of events that resulted in the current state of things'? If that is what you mean, then what 'we' have done is merely played our part in evolution- the weak are trampled and the strong go on to victory. It may seem wrong to justify it like that but be REALISTIC, human beings are a species like all others that is fighting against all odds for survival, we just happened to be WINNING, sorry about that.

Also, my opponent said that 'in a couple million years, we've destroyed this planet' as a rebuttal to my statement that 'we own this planet'. I was speaking metaphorically, as in our immense power over the planet, and my opponent took this literally and came up with an even DUMBER statement: 'we've destroyed the planet'. Really? We've destroyed it? Because when I look around, I see people shopping at supermarkets and living in heated, lighted homes and working with easy tasks instead of hunting for buffalo. I see barren land (objectively, of course) being transformed into neighborhoods that help families and individuals live lives that the kings of 500 years ago (before mass pollution) could never dream of.  Then my opponent said something so hypocritical, and really gave his debate away: 'Many humans do live on the brink of starvation, fighting predators to survive another day'. My opponent advocates environmentalism, which supports only those who live in such a way; you outlined a global tragedy that can only be solved by human beings who do NOT support environmentalism. When mining and manufacturing companies move into impoverished villages, they pay off the landowners and villagers and often build houses worth much more in order to give the villagers a place to live. Environmentalists constantly try to stop this with lawsuits. By your logic, all people should live like that.  You said that humans invented war. In a strong sense of the word, yes, you are correct. Yet, does this not stem from a purpose? Ideas. People have ideas, sometimes political or religious. These ideas have gotten us very far, indeed. Sometimes, however, people have conflicting ideas and one of them wants to force his ideas on the other. This results in a war. You have proven yourself wrong, by admitting that humans are the only species that have ideas to fight about.  Most bad things that have been done by humans (such as genocide) have been done by irrationalists (like yourself). Collectivism, communism, subjectivism, environmentalism, nationalism, racism, are all things that cause wars and devalue man. All of these things fall under the category of irrationalism, they are forms of philosophy that the Nazis follow.  The bad deeds of a few should not reflect poorly on the good done by everyone else.

    <t>Sorry for late delivery of this argument: I flew to New York to visit family during Christmas.  To correct my opponents reasoning, 'humans' advanced thinking does not benefit the common good.' Whether humans' ability to think clearly and rationally is objectively great, there is no 'common good' when it comes to inter-species contact. If you have ever watched the PBS program 'Nature', you know that it is usually a zero-sum game when it comes to survival. Our skills are good for US and that is what matters. My opponent also said, 'the Earth will crumble to global warming in a couple decades', which is completely null and void because global warming is a natural phenomenon that has been occurring since the end of the last ice age 14,000 years ago. I will not debate whether global warming is a real threat (or as real as eco-freaks make it out to be), nor if it is humans' fault- that is not the purpose of this debate (however, for the record, human beings are innocent in the climate change theory). My opponent then went further, 'we single handedly destroyed billions of years of progress to produce life forms as they are today'. Now, the term 'progress' was used very, very loosely here. Progress as in 'the evolution and random turn of events that resulted in the current state of things'? If that is what you mean, then what 'we' have done is merely played our part in evolution- the weak are trampled and the strong go on to victory. It may seem wrong to justify it like that but be REALISTIC, human beings are a species like all others that is fighting against all odds for survival, we just happened to be WINNING, sorry about that.

    <t>I would first like to thank my opponent for bringing up this debate. This is a very interesting topic.  First off I will refute my opponent's points and then present my own.  My opponent has said that Earth has thrown so much at the human race and we have survived. Well, obviously, tons of other species have too. Humans have been on Earth a fraction of the time so many other species have. He also said that we have the power of rational thinking and advancement. But the question here is: Are the human's advancements actually good to the common good? No, actually, if you look at the facts a lot of them aren't. The human race may only have another couple decades or so until the Earth crumbles to global warming. [1] Is it good that we single handedly DESTROYED billions of years of progress to produce life forms as they are today? Is the iPhone 6 really better than the commonwealth of everything on Earth? My opponent was even arrogant enough to say that we own this planet. Like I said earlier, we've only been around a couple million years and using that time, we've destroyed this planet. He said that it doesn't matter that dolphins have higher thinking skills because they haven't been able to build houses. News flash: Dolphins are underwater. They don't actually need to build houses. He finally said that 'we do not live on the brink of starvation, fighting predators to survive just another day.' Well, look at the news, my friend. Many humans do. 'We invent, capitalize, work and trade as much as we can.' Many other species are actually very advanced. Take the komodo dragon. They hunt their prey in such an advanced way, they have an animal lying around to munch on for months. They chase after it for a little bit, bite it, and then simply wait. Their saliva contains more than 50 different types of bacteria. [2] You do NOT want to get that stuff into your bloodstream. After so little, they come home with a massive hunk of meat that, like I said earlier, covers their food needs for months.  Now I would like to present my arguments:  1-Humans don't know when to stop: Like I said earlier, humans have pretty much screwed everything up. Even though humans created new stuff we DON'T KNOW WHEN TO STOP! All these other species have survived and thrived for twice or three times the time we have. Yet, they haven't destroyed the Earth in every possible way. Additionally, we didn't even realize what was going on until the 1970s. [3]  2-Humans are the most death-obsessed race: True, life is not all butterflies and rainbows. But humans have taken this to the next level. We have definitely invented one thing: war. Have you ever heard of a war between two groups of animals? Of course not. That's because they are not as obsessed with death and destruction as the human race. In fact, no animal has ever killed another animal of its own species for reasons other than cannibalism on purpose. Additionally, no other species constructs such elaborate ways to create mass genocide. I did mention the advanced tactics of the Komodo dragon earlier, but does this compare to the myriad of work done on creating nuclear missiles, or mastering the idea of radioactivity so that we can use it to destroy a city?</t>

    <t>My opponent started off by refuting my point that humans' advanced thinking does not benefit the common good. However, this argument still stands. According to him, if we are doing good for the short term life of our country, we are doing good for the world. This is the kind of thinking that humans use that HAS destroyed the world. If he will 'not debate whether global warming is a real threat,' then I will first put in a last reason to prove climate change is a real issue, and then provide another example. Global warming may have been going on since the dawn of time, but (I am not going to provide a source for this one, if you oppose it then you need to be educated,) we have been greatly helping this along through the mass releases of carbon in every little activity that we do. Take my next example, extinction. Here we have yet another example of the 'Great Expansion' of the human race. According to my opponent we are winning in the fight for survival, but to defend my point that we are the creators of war, (which my opponent supports, as I will later prove,) humans have taken this 'fight' way too far. Do other species kill other tons of their own species to prove an idea? No! His refutation to this point was very weak. Its only purpose was to advocate war. He implied evolution was not progress, but completely missed the point. He asked if 'the entire production of everything that supports BILLIONS of people all over the world that has lasted throughout human history and has benefited countless people just like your self better than preserving a certain sub-species of cheetahs?' but we can have a common ground here. Mass production of things we don't need stands in the way of preservation, but we don't have to become animals to help them. Do we need the iPhone 6, or the countless things a needless as it? No. But ignoring other beings because they are not vital to our own survival is different. You feel compassion for a dying animal on the side of the road, but not a broken phone. Then he went on to rant and call me a genocidal Nazi communist. He said that 'most bad things that have been done by humans have been done by irrationalists.' Well, yes, but he only proved me right here. The human race has so many problems and so do other species. We are equal. True, not everything is equal, but a criminal is not better than a cat, is it? A cat may not have ever done anything bad, but a criminal sure has. That's why he's a criminal. The cat is better than the criminal.  I will go out of this round providing some extra reasons to vote for my side. First, humans are the only mammal incapable of making their own vitamin C, which actually caused Ebola in Africa. Ebola circled around animals such as monkeys in Africa for a long time without harming them, but a human got it and started this whole Ebola epidemic. Finally, humans are animals too. We belong to the Animalia Kingdom.  I have indisputably won this debate.</t>

    <t>Clarification: This debate is on the basis of whether or not humans are better than animals in respect to development and utilization of the environment, i.e. the mastering of life.  Humans are a species that has adapted to their environment very well in the last 100,000 years. This means that as much as nature has thrown at us during ice ages, floods, famine, disease, heat, cold, and all other kinds of disasters, humans have come out on top every time. We have evolved to be much more intelligent in respect to language, conceptual thinking, perceptual thinking, insight, and mathematics. Rational thinking is strictly human, all other animals have varying levels of instinct and lower levels of perception. Even gorillas, whose brain patterns and development is close to humans, have not been able to construct most anything. Gorillas have not linked their logical side to their instinctual side, thus any similarity to humans is unpractical.  All other animals are even lower in development and utilization of the environment than humans. Both objectively and subjectively, humans own this planet. The term 'best' can be defined by the most utilized, practical talents among the creatures of the animal kingdom. For example, it doesn't matter in the slightest that dolphins are able to communicate well, because, in this moment in time they have failed to construct walls, housing, tools, or any other useful piece. This is why 'man-made' is a term used for pretty much anything that is 'made' by a living organism. Of course, ants, termites, and bees are close to humans in their social skills and developmental skills and thus could be said to be closer to humans than apes. However, our immense size (relative to smart insects) enables us to construct irrigation systems, mining and drilling operations, controlled fire, and most importantly, agriculture. These examples of utilization of the environment are absolutely impossible for creatures of insect size. Thus, the most important things in human life are strictly human.  The breaking free of 'need' is an achievement of humanity. As humans, we do not live on the brink of starvation, fighting predators to survive just another day. We are more profoundly adapt to our environment than other animals. With such ancient inventions as knives, wheels, clothing, fire, farming, and buildings, we are able to set aside the limited time in the day for 'play'. However, as smart beings, we use this extra time to reinvest in our welfare. We invent, capitalize, work, and trade as much as we can. With higher and higher returns in the standard of living, human beings have lifted from the mud and are the sole creature to have reached the stars.</t>

    <t>David Graber, an environmentalist at the National Parks Dept. once said, 'Until human beings can rejoin nature, we can only hope for the right virus to come along..'. That is a little unnerving, however it is the basic consensus of the leaders of the environmental movement. My opponent implies that humans are not apart of nature, only a force against it. This means that you and I, if he is right, must be a plague upon the earth, and that we must be wiped out.  I know for sure that my opponent will next ride over that statement, saying that it is 'foolish' and 'absurd'. All environmentalists do. However, I ask you this: if my opponent considers building a farm a form of net destruction (as he stated), he must consider trees and 'the millions of different life forms inside them' vastly more important than human beings like you and me.  This kind of thinking- that humans are equal to all life forms- engenders questions of the limits of 'rights'. In other words, does the ebola virus have the same right to exist as a human being? Obviously, common sense would dictate not. But, if you follow my opponent's reason to it's logical conclusion, a human has no right to murder a virus! This kind of nonsense is what happens if you take environmentalism too far; but honestly, name something in history that wasn't taken too far. This line of thinking is evil, it implies that we are not more evolved than the lower animals, ad thus have no right to act as a dominant species.  My opponent keeps bringing up guns, murder, genocide, and war. Obviously, he is preoccupied with the bad parts of human life (as if the possession of reason has proved to be a net loss). If you consider how he points to the evils done by a few men, and blames them on the entire species, you can tell he has no chance of being correct in his argument. He skipped over my point that 'the iPhone 6 is not a main source of pollution', clearly to avoid questioning our need for energy and food and shelter and paper and all other things we use everyday. If my opponent questioned our need for those most essential things, he would most definitely lose this lose this debate. Of course, the fifth amendment does protect you from admitting self-incriminating evidence!</t>

    <t>My opponent clearly doesn't understand what the term 'destroyed' refers to when he uses it. In the context 'humans have destroyed the world' he overlooks that in this situation there is a beneficiary. Therefore, it depends on the perspective. If I cut down 100 trees in order to build a farm that feeds a small town, is it destruction? This is the question that my opponent cannot ask.  When I said that I will not debate global warming, I meant right here, right now. In a separate debate, I would debate that. I do not 'support' war, but I (unlike my opponent) understand that it is the bad side of something inherently good, ideas. My opponent also keeps bringing up the iPhone 6, as if that is a major source of environmental pollution. Maybe you should ask, 'do we need electricity?' not 'do we need the iPhone 6?'. I realize that humans ARE apart of the animal kingdom, this debate's topic (as I specified) is whether humans are the BEST in the animal kingdom.  Obviously, my opponent sees human beings as the sole source of win-lose environmental change; this would mean that other species do not run each other 'out of business'. I am clearly the rationalist in this debate.</t>

    <t>'If I cut down 100 trees in order to build a farm that feeds a small town, is it destruction?' The answer, in fact, is yes. The 'innovators' such as my opponent ignore the fact that other living beings exist. 100 trees could house millions of different life forms! If genocide such as this is required to do something as simple as build a farm, then yes. It is destruction. I am using the iPhone 6 as one of countless examples of needless products mass produced for no reason. He said that other species do run each other 'out of business,' but he didn't really help his side. He just made a vague metaphor that I believe meant that other species kill each other too. This is true, but my opponent has yet again missed my point, that humans have taken this fight and warped it into something that spawns genocide, nuclear weaponry, even just guns. My opponent has not responded to many of my points and I have responded effectively to all of his. I have clearly and inevitably won this debate.</t>

This is the sort of idea that sparks one of humans's creations: genocide. Then he began going very extremely into this ideal, but viruses such as Ebola are not actually organisms, and therefore cannot feel. 'Murdering' Ebola would have the same effect on Ebola as kicking a rock would on the rock. Can the rock feel? No, and neither can viruses and the other examples my opponent was implying. Then he went on to call me evil. He, all throughout this debate, has been attacking me personally, calling me a evil genocidal Nazi communist. This only proves he has realized that I have already won this debate, and is just angry with me. I am, in his opinion, 'preoccupied with the bad parts of human life.' Well, as I have proven, most of the 'advances' of the human race have resulted in problems for the last couple hundred years. I didn't skip over his point that 'the iPhone 6 is not a main source of pollution,' I proved it was wrong. I have been using the iPhone 6 as an EXAMPLE, not the sole reason against humanity. In the above round, I talk more about this, so I did respond to his point. 'Mass production of things we don't need stands in the way of preservation, but we don't have to become animals to help them. Do we need the iPhone 6, or the countless things a needless as it? No. But ignoring other beings because they are not vital to our own survival is different. You feel compassion for a dying animal on the side of the road, but not a broken phone,' to quote myself. In the final debate, I will provide again my two main arguments used in the first round:  1-Humans don't know when to stop: My opponent has mainly focused on this argument, but still has not proven it wrong. As you will see if you scroll through this page, humans have, yes, destroyed the Earth. My opponent 'refuses to debate global warming,' but that's OK, because there are so many other examples I've shown throughout this debate: extinction, deforestation, and so on.  2-Humans are the most death-obsessed race: My opponent mentioned this once to partially agree with it. He used a weak refutation that war was about ideas, but there are other ways to prove an idea, and if you can kill more people than the other guy, that doesn't mean you're right. No other species has killed another of its own species purposefully for reasons other than cannibalism.  Now, a couple more reasons I have provided throughout: Humans are the only mammal incapable of making their own vitamin C, the cat vs. criminal example (a criminal is not better than a cat, is it? A cat may not have ever done anything bad, but a criminal sure has. That's why he's a criminal. The cat is better than the criminal), and weighing on scope (more animals than humans).

    <t>The sun drives of climate change The main driver of modern climate is solar activity. The energy output of the sun, called the irradiance. has been nearly constant in modern times, so that's not the cause. It is primarily the magnetic field of the sun which drives climate, and to a lesser extent the ultraviolet component of the irradiance. The magnet component varies dramatically. Norwegian scientists in the 1990's discovered that the single measure of solar activity that best predicts climate is the length of the previous solar cycle. “The most readily apparent cycle in solar activity is the cycle in sunspot activity. These solar cycles average eleven years in length, and they have ranged in length from nine years to beyond eighteen years.“ [1] The length of the solar predicts climate change as shown in the graph [2] below:The increase in CO2 is very close to exponential, so as Pro noted, AGW theory predicts a straight line temperature rise. The graph shows clearly that is not what has happened. Climate has been behaving according to solar activity. “A paper published [in 2012] in the Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physicsfinds that up to 72% of the temperature increase over the last 150 years can be explained by the length of solar cycles,” [3] The length of the solar cycle does not perfectly represent the sun effects, so it's likely that a more precise model would produce a more precise result.  Cosmic rays affect cloud cover  The physical theory that explains the correlation is summarized by Archibald: There are two main ways that changing solar activity affects terrestrial climate. Both have their origin in the strength of the Sun’s magnetic field. In the first route, a lower magnetic field strength results in less sunspot activity, which in turn mean less solar wind, which allows more galactic cosmic rays to get to Earth’s orbit. The neutron shower from galactic cosmic rays causes more cloud formation, which in turn reflects more sunlight back into space, making the Earth colder. … In the second route, the lower magnetic field strength results in a lower temperature of the Sun’s chromosphere, which in turn produces less ultraviolet light. That decreases the production of lower stratospheric ozone, and that decrease causes a negative North Atlantic Oscillation (a fluctuation in sea-level atmospheric pressure), making the Northern Hemisphere colder. This second route makes winters longer and colder without necessarily reducing peak summer temperatures. [4] If solar magnetic activity really changes cloud cover, the incident radiance on the earth should vary with the sun's magnetic activity. That has been observed just as the solar theory predicts. [5] Solar activity is measured historically by the formation of beryllium 10, which accumulates in sediments to provide a history of solar activity. “The Modern Warm Period from 1900 to 2008 is associated with a large decline in Be10 in ice cores, indicating a sustained higher level of solar activity in the twentieth century. There is also very close correlation between ice-rafted stone debris in the North Atlantic and Be10 levels over the last 10,000 years—another demonstration that solar activity controls climate.” [6] The correlation continues through to the present day. Solar activity predicts the 17+ year halt in global warming as the cycle has reached a flat peak and is starting downward. The pause in global warming is illustrated in this graph: [7]:The AGW computer models include irradiance, which is essentially constant, but the models take no account at all of the solar magnetic effects that correlate tightly with climate. AGW theorists now admit that the CO2 models cannot be tweaked to explain the pause. They are now proposing a variety of new theories to patch the failed old theory. [8] One theory is that for some reason all the warming is going into the deep oceans. Another theory is that atmospheric aerosols (i.e., soot) is reducing the size of rain drops causing clouds to be whiter and reflect more energy. There are other theories. The problem is that if there is any uncalculated factor that completely wipes out CO2 effects, that admits CO2 does not dominate climate. If uncalculated factors can be as large or larger than the CO2 effect, that admits that previous warming might have been the result of unknown factors as well. The premise of the AGW theory was that because all the other factors affecting climate were known, CO2 must have caused the warming from 1983 to 1996.  Historically, solar activity drives climate with CO2 rising after there is warmingAl Gore famously showed two graphs, one of temperature over time and one of CO2 over time. The shapes of the curves were similar, showing a high correlation. Mr. Gore never overlaid the graphs. Had he done so, it would have been apparent that CO2 levels were following the warming rather by hundreds of years rather than leading it. As the oceans warm, they can dissolve less CO2, which is then released into the atmosphere. The CO2 rise is in response to the solar magnetic effects that changed cloud cover to cause the basic climate change.Over long periods of earth's history, there is no relationship between CO2 and climate.[8]Consensus does not determine sciencePro has the burden of proving that human activity has dominated climate. My burden is only to show that the anthropogenic theory is unproved. A scientific theory is wrong if it fails to explain or predict, and anthropogenic theory has clearly failed. I'm not obligated to prove an alternative theory, but I nonetheless shown that solar magnetic activity explains and predicts climate much better than CO2 theory. Since solar magnetic activity has dominated climate, anthropogenic causes cannot be dominant. AGW theorists admit that factors not in their computer models have been so large as to completely cancel greenhouse gas effects. for the past 17+ years.Pro stresses that it is not just that a consensus exists, but that the consensus is based on data. (Actually, the only real data is a general increase in temperature which solar theory better explains, and the rest is computer models that did not predict the hiatus.) But every scientific consensus has been supported by data that scientists at the time thought conclusive. A wrong consensus means that the data was incorrect or that it was incorrectly interpreted. The once near-unanimous consensus that the earth was the center of the universe was based upon the indisputable observation that the sky appears to rotate around the earth. The theory was found wrong only by more careful observations starting with the inconsistent behavior of the paths of planets in the sky. In the 1960s, the scientific consensus favored the Steady State Theory over the Big Bang Theory. The Big Bang Theory predicted the presence of microwave background radiation, so when the background radiation was discovered, the consensus changed rapidly. Not long ago, the learned scientific consensus was that homosexuality was a form of mental illness. Psychologists thought they had the data to prove it, but they were wrong; it is genetic. Modern scientists continue to make errors reflected in wrong consensus. A very strong scientific consensus has until the past few years supported the theory that in the human diet, saturated fat causes high serum cholesterol levels which in turn causes heart disease. It turns out the original theory was based upon falsified data. The landmark peer that 'proved' the theory deliberately excluded data that falsified the theory. A couple of other bogus papers supported the theory, including one in which cholesterol was injected into vegetarian rabbits, who then quite predictably died. Studies over the past fifty years that attempted to confirm the theory instead disproved it. [9, 10] The originator of the cholesterol theory believed it, and he did a great job of selling the theory so it quickly reached consensus.. Many papers giving the “wrong” results were not allowed to be published, or the authors declined to submit them for fear of ruining their reputation. Some scientists published after they retired so that career retribution could not be inflicted. I recite the cholesterol consensus error because it's very close to the way anthropogenic global warming theory has achieved consensus. Early enthusiastic advocates sold the theory as the only possible explanation of the rapid rise of temperatures from 1983 to 1996. According to that data, not only was CO2 the cause, but climate sensitivity much have been very large, perhaps five or even ten. Now Pro's claim is that it is at least 0.7. If it is that low, then global warming is not a crisis. it's hardly worth noting. The bogus 97% consensus comes from surveying only journals that refuse to publish dissent. The Climategate scandal showed how eager AGW are to suppress dissent.'In a November 15, 2005, email Mann expresses his satisfaction that Geophysical Research Letters is now firmly under the control of the climate change alarmists but laments that other publications still publish research by skeptics: “The Geophysical Research Letters leak may have been plugged up now with new editorial leadership there, but these guys always have Climate Research and Energy and Environment, and will go there if necessary.” [9]Very few papers scientific papers say anything about global warming as whole. For example, there are about 200 papers that show that the Medieval Warm Period and similar climate change existed worldwide, and that refute the bogus Hockey Stick argument for AGW. But the papers would not be counted as being in opposition to AGW. Besides, they are in the wrong journals. Virtually all the papers on solar theory -- there are hundreds -- are in specialist journals, not the surveyed climate journals.Per the terms of of the debate, I'll put the reference list in the debate comments.</t>

    <t>== Rebuttals ==    R1) Solar cycle as a driver of climate   It is good that Roy discards the idea that TSI can explain the modern temperature increase. Even skeptical climatologists are beginning to accept this, they note TSI can explain “virtually none” of the warming past 1950 [1].  Roy begins by citing a 1991 study by Friis-Christensen et al (his graph). The study purported to claim the solar cycle length correlated with temperatures. It must be noted Christensen’s temperature data ended in 1985, which ignores a huge portion of the warming which occurred in the 1990s.  Christensen’s study was criticized for mathematical errors. A new paper has come out and corrected the errors from the original paper. The result was solar cycle length did not correlate well with temperature. Solar cycle length did correlate with temperatures until 1985—when the dataset for Friss-Christensen et al. ended—but after 1985, the correlation broke apart. Solar cycle length fell as temperatures began to dramatically increase. The correlation Roy uses in his graph has since been falsified [2]. The following graph shows the updated correlation:          The mathematical errors are shown by this graph [3]:            As can be seen, Roy’s source is flawed and newer measurements prove that solar cycle lengths cannot explain the modern warming.    Roy then cites a paper purportedly claiming 72% of the earth’s increase in temperature is due to the solar cycle. Roy cites a skeptical blog, and the blog exaggerated the findings. 72% of the temperature change in the North Atlantic can be explained by solar fluctuations, according to the study—not global temperatures. If you go to the actual source it says “[w]e find for the Norwegian local stations investigated that 25–56% of the temperature increase the last 150 years may be attributed to the Sun” [emphasis added] [4]. You can see the study is looking into local stations, not global phenomena! Roy’s 72% number is an exaggeration and is in relation to one region, not the entire globe.   Evidence shows global temperatures do NOT correlate with solar cycle lengths, and much of the evidence Roy uses relies upon local Norwegian data. Not global data. Therefore, Roy fails to prove that the sun correlates well with global temperature.     R2) Cosmic rays and climate   For cosmic rays to explain climate change, all of the following must be true: 1) the solar magnetic field must have a long-term negative trend, 2) the cosmic ray flux must have a long-term negative trend, 3) cosmic rays must create low level clouds, 4) low level clouds must have a long term negative trend [5].   The solar magnetic field actually has not changed much over the last 30 years. The correlation between temperature and cosmic rays is fairly weak. Even assuming that the correlation exists, it is about equal to the anti-correlation of TSI (which has been falling, and leading to cooling). Cosmic rays have had little overall impact on temperatures over the last few decades [6].   Have cosmic rays had a long-term negative trend? No. Cosmic rays have had no discernable trend from 1951 to 2006, and have stayed relatively stable [5]. Further, the GCR (galactic cosmic ray) flux only correlated with temperature between 1970 and 1985, and even then it lagged temperature. The correlation totally breaks down in the 1990s. The changes in the GCR flux cannot be the cause of more than 15% of the observed temperature increase [7]. In fact, some research has found the GCR flux is increasing. SkepticalScience, quoting Erlykin et al. 2013, notes “[r]ecent measurements of the cosmic ray intensity show that a former decrease with time has been reversed. Thus, even if cosmic rays enhanced cloud production, there would be a small global cooling, not warming” (emphasis original) [5]. If GCR’s have been causing a net-cooling, they cannot explain the warming trend.   Do GCR’s cause low-level cloud cover? No. The correlation between GCR’s and cloud cover begins to disintegrate in 1989. By 1994, the correlation completely breaks apart, and there is no way that we can see changes in the GCR flux affecting low-level clouds, as can be seen in the graph [8].         Cosmic rays are red, versus low cloud cover (blue). We see little correlation between the two.   Do low-level clouds have a negative effect on temperature? There is conflicting evidence here [5]. Regardless, GCR’s don’t seem to change cloud cover or correlate well with temperature.   R3) The ‘pause’   Roy claims surface temperature has shown no trend recently. He is using RSS data. UAH data finds an increase of temperature over the same period [9].   Over such a short time period, it is impossible to get statistically significant results. So in order to reduce data uncertainty, I will change the data to 1970 – present. With this, we will always see a warming trend. However, if this ‘pause’ is significant, we should see a large change in trends. Using HADCRUT4 data, from 1970 – 1996 (‘pause’ began in 1996) we get .153 C/decade with a margin of error of 0.067. Then to see if the ‘pause’ significantly reduces this trend, I now extend the data from 1970 – 2014. What do I get? 0.165 degrees C per decade with a margin of error 0.030 [9]. We see no decrease in the overall trend, which would occur if the ‘pause’ were significant. And this method reduces data-uncertainty. So we see there is no statistically significant slowdown of the warming trend in HADCRUT4 data.   The long-term trend of increasing temperatures is due to CO2. Short-term variability happens all the time; it does not mean that the long-term increase is going to stabilize forever. La Nina events have decreased surface warming. La Nina is an oscillation, it is not a long-term phenomena, and will revert to a positive trend eventually. Many models that account for these oscillations do reproduce the ‘pause’. When these factors are accounted for, greenhouse warming still continues to exist [10]. The assertion that models cannot account for the pause is simply incorrect.   The oceans increased heat content, aerosol cooling, La Nina events, etc. all lead to cooling. The fact that any warming has happened at all (see my UAH amp; HADCRUT4 analysis) is supportive of idea that CO2 is a strong climate driver.   R4) Paleoclimate   Roy begins by claiming CO2 lags temperature. Although he cites no source (or at least, not in that paragraph) I know where he got the claim. I cited the exact paper with that claim last round! It claimed there was an 800 year lag between past climate changes and CO2 concentrations. What skeptics don't tell us—and what the paper actually said—is CO2 still acted as an amplifier to other climate changes (a positive feedback for the orbital forcing of the interglacial cycle). CO2 preceded northern hemispheric deglaciation. If you actually read the papers, which claim there to be a lag, they almost all note how CO2 acts as an amplifier and how the results do not contradict AGW. There is new research (Shakun et al.), which argued that CO2 preceded the end of the last ice age, and may have (in part) led to the warm interglacial in which we live today [11]. The following graph from the study demonstrates how CO2 may have been an important factor in the most recent deglaciation:         Blue = temperature, Red (and yellow) = CO2 concentrations.   The recent Shakun study demonstrates how CO2 may have, in part, ended the last ice age.     Roy goes on to claim there is no correlation between CO2 and past temperatures. I followed his sources. The first one was temperature data and made no comments on correlation. Berner 2001 is the other source. I cited this exact study last round. I pulled a direct quote out of the study. I will reiterate it here, “over the long term there is indeed a correlation between CO2 and paleotemperature” [R2]. Using Roy’s sources, we see that CO2 does correlate with temperatures.   Roy’s graph is also a oversimplification. It fails to mention that there ARE other forcings in climate. The other major forcing, the sun, does not correlate well with phanerzoic temperatures either. When the two are put together, there is a strong correlation [12]. The sun alone cannot account for temperatures, and CO2 alone cannot account for the temperatures. When put together, they do. This indicates that CO2 is a very important factor in determining climate. The following graph from the paper depicts the correlation when CO2 and the sun are put together:      R5) Consensus   I agree with Roy that consensus does not tell us whether or not science is correct. The consensus is not what makes the science clear. But there is a consensus because the science is clear. And Roy claims his data supports solar theory. However, I have adequately dismantled that argument using peer-reviewed research and Roy’s own sources.   Roy attempts to claim I have the BOP. This is incorrect. A review of the rules in round one tells us, (rule 5) the BOP is split evenly. Therefore, Roy has an equally important role in disproving AGW as I do in proving it.   Roy shows examples of the consensus failing. This can occur, but citing a few high profile cases back when science was less rigorous is not very compelling. Modern science requires empirical evidence for scientific claims. And as most experts believe in AGW, chances are, strong empirical evidence corroborates the theory.   Roy makes a claim about catastrophic warming. This is not what we are debating, it is irrelevant.    Roy claims climategate shows how scientists ‘suppress’ the science. A reading through the emails, in context, really shows no malice was intended [13]. Multiple independent panels have reviewed the emails, and concluded that no scientific malpractice was committed [14].   Conclusion   The sun is not the cause of the recent warming trend. Paleoclimate continues to give credence to the idea that increased CO2 levels warm the climate. Man is the main driver of modern global warming.</t>

    <t>I thank Roy for accepting this debate. He is one of the best debaters on the site and is very knowledgeable on this subject. It is a pleasure to debate him. ==There exists a scientific consensus== Before I continue, I would like to note this argument in and of itself does not prove that global warming is caused by man. Actual evidence should be the driving force behind this debate. The reason I chose to put this in my argument is simple: the science is not clear because of consensus, but a consensus exists because the evidence is clear. This evidence will be discussed later. A study published in Science reviewed the ISI web of science in order to take a survey of relevant climate literature as to what the causes of climate change are. The study failed to find a single paper which was in opposition to the consensus position, that the main driver of climate change is anthropogenic. 75% of the papers supported the consensus position, whereas 25% had no position (they were focused on things other than forgings, like impacts or paleoclimate) [1]. The study also noted how many organizations have come out supporting the idea of anthropogenic climate change. The IPCC, the American Meteorological Society, American Geophysical Union, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science have all concluded that the evidence for AGW is overwhelming [2]. NASA furthers this argument, noting “most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position”. They also argue “[n]inety-seven percent of climate scientists agree that climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities” [3]. A 196 page report representing 13 governmental agencies, and written by 28 authors from scientific institutions, has stated “[t]he global warming of the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced increases in heat-trapping gases” [4]. ==Climate sensitivity== As Roy is well aware, this is the key point in all of climate science (we have discussed this before in a PM). For those who are unaware, climate sensitivity is defined as how much warming is produced by a doubling of CO2. Both skeptics and AGW supporters agree that the direct effect of doubling CO2 is one degree C, the debate is over feedbacks [5]. First, what is a feedback? Climate skeptic Roy Spencer explains it fairly simply. He describes a forcing as how much temperature change occurs. A feedback determines how large the change in temperatures will be. Feedbacks refer to how clouds and other warming/cooling mechanisms change in response to a forcing (i.e. CO2, TSI, CRs). He also explains positive and negative feedbacks. Take a car, for example. The temperature forcing would be the sun beating down on the car. Opening the window slowly would cool the car, over time, and be a negative feedback. On the other hand, if you were to close the window, the car would warm (due to an enhanced greenhouse effect), which would be a positive feedback [6]. So the question is whether or not the climate is dominated by negative or positive feedbacks. There is even the possibility of there being no feedbacks, as the positive and negatives could cancel each other out. Research by climate skeptics published in Climate Research has demonstrated that climate sensitivity, based on model means, is 1.9 degrees C. Using differing methods of empirical approaches, they conclude that climate sensitivity is 1 – 1.6 degrees C [7]. Although these estimates shy towards having no net-amplifier, the no-amplification scenario still supports a strong influence of man on climate. In fact, to put an answer numerically, about 50% of the warming would be caused by man if there was no net-feedback [8]. Assuming no amplifier, research has found that “the largest contribution to the 20th century warming comes from anthropogenic sources” [9]. They find that of the ~0.7 degree C temperature rise in the 20th century (some estimates slightly higher), about 0.4 degrees of that are due to anthropogenic forgings, or about 57% of the warming (personal calculation from these skeptical studies and personal correspondence with their authors). A significant body of research notes that climate sensitivity is likely much higher. A review of the evidence in 2008 finds that mean climate sensitivity is 3 degrees C, with a range of 2 – 4.5 degrees C. Based on multiple lines of evidence, we see *almost* every which way to measure climate sensitivity leads to approximately the same result: a doubling of CO2 will lead to 3 degrees C of temperature rise [10]. The following graphic from the study corroborates this:   The gray is the range (2 – 4.5 degrees C), the line in the center is on 3 degrees C, and the circles in the lines are the ‘very likely’ ranges. Most of them rest on the 3 degree mark, with some under and some above. Therefore, we can conclude that from these lines of evidence, mean sensitivity is about 3 degrees C. Another study replicates the above conclusions. The upper limit for climate sensitivity is around 4 degrees C, and certainly below 6 degrees C. Using a Bayesian statistical approach, which is “the dominant [method] in the literature”, these findings support the notion of climate sensitivity as maximum 4 degrees C, a mean of 3 degrees C, and likely not lower than 3 degrees [11]. The following graph [12] again details the results of many different studies. The best estimates generally center around 2.5 – 3 degrees C.   Some evidence published in 2012 claims sensitivity is on the low end of the spectrum, however, still note that “[h]umanity is . . . responsible for the most recent period of warming from 1976 to 2010” [13]. The fact is, climate sensitivity is high and the climate system is predominated by positive feedback mechanisms. Whether it be due to changes in clouds, increased water vapor, or long-term albedo changes. With a climate sensitivity of 1 (no positive or negative forcings), anthropogenic CO2 still causes up to 50% of the warming. With a climate sensitivity of 3 degrees C, humanity is the main driver of climate from about 1976 through present (see, e.g., [13]). ==Paleoclimate== There is significant evidence from paleoclimate records that CO2 can have an effect on changes in the climate. Climate skeptic and paleoclimatologist Bob Carter emphasizes the importance of paleoclimate data. He compares climate to a piece of string. The current instrumental data (1850 – present) is a very short period of time, according to Carter. And when the ‘string’ is lengthened, we see a lot of climactic variability. Instead of looking at the recent past, we should look at the entire temperature record in order to get an accurate picture of the climate [14]. I will provide evidenc, contrary to what Carter believes, lengthening the string supports AGW theory. Over the Cenozoic Era, which began 66 million years ago, we see clear warming and cooling cycles caused by changes in CO2 concentrations. The sun increased slightly over that time period, whereas temperatures cooled. CO2, however, fell steadily through that time period. Plate tectonics was also accounted for. With natural forcings an unlikely cause, “CO2 was the dominant climate forcing in the Cenozoic” [15]. When you lengthen the ‘string’ over the course of the entire Phanerozoic (500 million years; begins at the Cambrian) there is still evidence of CO2 driving multiple climate changes. The GEOCARB study, published in 2001, is one of the definitive proxy records for CO2 concentrations within the last 500 million years. The study notes that “over the long term there is indeed a correlation between CO2 and paleotemperature” [16]. Evidence from the Vostok ice cores (specifically 240,000 before present), proves that CO2 has had an effect on temperatures. Although the initial forcing was orbital changes in the sun, CO2 “plays . . . a key role in amplifying the initial orbital forcing” and “the CO2 increase clearly precedes the Northern Hemi sphere deglaciation”. The study also notes that these forcings “are also at work for the present-day and future climate” [17]. There is also proof that it is warmer now than it has been since the MWP. In fact, it is warmer now than any year since 1400 AD [18]. Newer reconstructions continue to support this finding, and even extends the dataset. It finds that the Roman warm period (RWP) and the MWP as much cooler than today, and claims to have replicated previous ‘hockey stick’ studies [19]. The results are depicted below.   Looking into the geologic past, we see strong evidence in favor of the idea that carbon dioxide can increase temperature. It logically follows that if humans continue to emit CO2, and other greenhouse gasses, that human emissions will increase temperatures. Conclusion: It is clear as to *why* a scientific consensus exists. There is overwhelming evidence that 1) climate sensitivity is likely high, 2) even if it wasn’t, anthropogenic forces still account for 50% or more of the warming (from CO2 alone, not counting methane and other greenhouse gases), and 3) that when you ‘lengthen’ the piece of string, there is still ample evidence ample evidence supporting the fact that CO2 can drive temperatures. The consensus itself does not prove AGW—but the evidence proves the consensus. CO2 is the main driver of recent temperature changes.</t>

    <t>AGW Models fail, so the theory is wrongWe have agreed on a couple of basic points of climate science: 1. If AGW is true then warming should occur as a straight line over time. 2. The heat output of the sun is not changing, so that isn't upsetting the straight line AGW So, if AGW has dominated climate over last century then we should see a straight line increase in temperature over the century, with just short term variations due to weather. Here is the temperature data. Pro told us in his initial argument that the minimum value for climate sensitivity under AGW is 3 degrees per century. He said it might be more, but it's at least three degrees. To test if AGW dominates climate, we can see how close the temperature data is to a straight line with a three dree slope. I took the temperature from Wikipedia [1] and added the line (in blue) predicted by AGW:  Clearly AGW theory is wrong. It's possible that carbon dioxide is adding a temperature increase to climate just as AGW predicts, but that some other unaccounted factor is canceling the AGW before about 1980 and after about 2000. Our debate is about whether AGW dominates climate, so if it is try that an unknown factor completely changes climate from what AGW contributes, then it is the unknown factor that dominates, not AGW.  Why did a theory so far from the data ever take hold? The problem AGW attempts to explain is the rise from about 1980 to 1996, and many atmospheric scientists could not come up with an explanation other than CO2. To explain all the pre-1980 data that did not conform, Professor Mann and his colleagues came up with the Hockey Stick curve, that purported to show that climate had not changed at all in the past 1000 years. The Hockey Stick turned out to be the product of a bad statistical method that selected proxies for temperature that were unrelated to temperature. The current Wikipedia article on the Hockey Stick shows the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age as global climate change. Both are explained by solar magnetic theory.  The fatal blow to AGW theory is the lack of warming since 1996. The blue curve on the graph shows how far we are below the AGW theoretical prediction. Pro argues that the HADCru data shows some warming, but there is close to universal agreement that the models have failed. HADCru uses ground station data which focuses on urban areas that warm due to growth with surrounding population increase. The satellite data covers the whole earth with no such complications. NASA acknowledges the pause in global warming [2] the ‘pause’ in global surface temperature that began in 1997, according to some estimates, continues,” wrote David Whitehouse, who holds a doctorate in astrophysics and was the BBC’s science editor. “Statistically speaking there has been no trend in global temperatures over this period.” HADCru fully acknowledges the existence of the pause in global warming, but dutifully insists that the underlying AGW has just been overcome by other factors. Those factors must, of course, now dominate AGW. [3] Papers by von Storch [4] and Rasmussen [5], both previously vigorous defenders of AGW, show the AGW models have failed. Not only have the models failed, but there is no way to tweak them, say by changing climate sensitivity, to get them to fit the data. A book by Tisdale [6] shows graphically that the models cannot be fixed.  Measures of Solar ActivityRemember, I'm not obliged to explain why the AGW models have failed, only that there is no possibility that the AGW linear trend of 3 degrees per century, which Pro claimed as all but certain science, is not true so that AGW is not dominating climate. The exact nature of the sun's influence on climate is not known, and Pro argues convoincingly that the length of the solar cycle has not been born out as being as good a predictor as thought. Nonetheless the correlation to solar activity remains strong. The long Medieval Cold Period, the Medieval Warm Period, and the Little Ice Age all corrsponded to solar activity. [6]Right now we are in a period of decreasing sunspot activity [7]:  That the correlation to sunspot activity is not perfect means no more than that climate is complex. To say that AGW dominates climate is unfounded, because there is all but universal agreement that the models have failed.Paleoclimate That CO2 lags warming is uncontested basic physics. As the oceans heat, CO2 comes out of solution and CO2 enters the atmosphere. If it amplifies heating trends, that is no proof that CO2 dominates climate. Whatever starts and ends the heating trend dominates climate and CO2 magnifies the swings in boith directions.Whether the present is warmer than the Medieval Warm Period or the Roman Warm Period is not the slightest proof of what caused any of the warming or cooling. What is does show is that substantial warming in past climate has happened without any CO2 effect. If we got nearly as warm as the present in the MWP. then whatever caused that was not CO2 and may be working now.The long history of climate shows very little relationship to CO2, and Pro acknoweldges that. So what factors were at work, and how do we know what is at work now?  Variations in the earth's orbit are not nearly enough to explain the changes. We have some ideas, but there is nothing that's proved reliable, especially not AGW theory.Pro burden is no more than to prove that AGW dominates climate. He has not done so.</t>

<h>AGW exists, it but doesn't dominate climate Greenhouse gases cause warming, and I never claimed otherwise. Pro cited a skeptical climate scientist acknowledgment that AGW plays some role in climate. Our resolution is “Global warming is man made.” That might mean that global warming is entirely man made, in which case Pro has conceded it is not, because he has acknowledged that there are also natural causes. I didn't take that meaning. I said repeatedly that Pro must prove that climate is dominated by AGW. I must prove it does not. The proof of AGW would be a AGW math mathematical model of climate that accurately explains and predicts. Weather effects are yearly variations; climate comprises trends over several years. The AGW models fail because the models do not predict or explain climate the large trends in climate. For example, Pro acknowledges that Medieval Warm Period was due to solar activity, but the official IPCC models have no mechanism that explains the MWP. Because AGW models cannot explain the MWP, climate crisis advocates have fought consistently to make the MWP disappear as a global climate phenomena. The Hockey Stick got rid of it by a statistical error, but the data ultimately won. A change in climate acknowledged to be very close to modern warming is unexplained by the models we are supposed to accept as reliable. The pause in global warming is real Pro argued that an 17 year pause in global warming might just be “noise,” and he cited a scientific paper that allegedly shows that. That's bad science. Suppose an engineer designed a building taking into account all the other factors he knew to affect design, and the building subsequently collapsed. Consider: “The design models were correct. The building collapsed due to unknown factors categorized as noise. There is no need for further explanation.” Nonsense. Fundamental failures are not noise. An eighteen year failure of climate prediction shows that the model is defective. Since AGW is in the model, and something else canceled it, the unknown factor dominated climate over the period. I quoted both HADCru and NASA scientists as acknowledging the pause in global warming. The paper by AGW-advocate von Storch established that the current models cannot be tweaked to explain the pause. Pro found some oddball paper that made a model that shows a pause, but models can be made to do anything desired. AGW theory is not validated until after it makes accurate predictions. Making a new, unproved model means we are back to the starting point. Pro said that HADCru land data showed an increase. Year-to-year variations occur with weather, and so there is so uncertainty in the trends due to the accuracy of fitting a line through the weather-induced variations. The HADCru data shows 0.09 +/- 0.11 degree of global warming over the period of the pause, compared to the 0.4 to 1 degree predicted by the AGW models. None of the six global temperature data sets showed a statistically significant increase. [http://wattsupwiththat.com...] The land data sets are the least accurate because increasing urbanization drives up the temperatures near many of the weather station locations, due to the so-called “heat island” effect. The satellite data is the most accurate because it samples the earth uniformly, and it shows no increase. HADCru scientists understand the large departure from the models, and acknowledge the pause. Pro said I acknowledged that the Sun could not be causing the pause in global warming. That's not true, but if it were true, it would not help Pro's case. If it's not the sun, then a completely unsuspected factor dominated climate and overwhelmed AGW. However, what I acknowledged was that the length of the previous solar cycle was not a good predictor. I presented the historical graph that showed the level of sunspot activity correlated well with the warmth of the MWP, the cold of the Little Ice Age, and the warming of the 20th century. Pro acknowledged the solar cause of those changes. Sunspots do not correlate to the heat output of the sun, so the effect on climate must be a different physical cause: magnetic field, cosmic rays, ultraviolet spectrum, or something else. It might be some complex combination of the effects. The graphs show that cold climate is associated with low sunspot activity and warm climate with high sunspot activity. The 20th century covered a long period of high sunspot activity, which explains the warming. Recently, sunspot activity has dropped, correlated to the pause. The number of sunspots remains a reliable longer term climate predictor. AGW predicts straight line temperature increase I presented a graph showing actual global temperatures and AGW predicting a strong straight line increase. My graph is accurate, but I should have better explained the AGW line in comparison to the actual climate data. Here is the graph, repeated from the earlier round:   Temperature responds to the logarithm of greenhouse gas density, and greenhouse gas density has been increasing exponentially. The log of an exponential is a straight line. As far as I know, all climate scientists agree on this. Therefore, AGW should produce a straight line. Pro said that the models also include some natural effects like volcanoes, so the model predictions need not be a straight line increase. However, the debate resolution is that AGW dominates climate. While natural causes upset the perfect straight line behavior to some degree, they cannot dominate. While there may be some blips, like the blip of cold for a couple years from the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo, there should be no problem recognizing a straight line. The temperature data is not close to any straight line, so AGW is not dominating. We are far below what the models predict for the present year. The slope of the line of temperature increase over time depends both on climate sensitivity and the rate of carbon dioxide increase. The behavior of temperature with CO2 is logarithmic, so Pro's computation of what it should be is way off. Initially a small increase in CO2 produces a large increase in temperature, with later increases in CO2 having less and less effect. Suppose CO2 increased in units from 1 to 16, and that the increase from from 1 to 2 brought one degree of warming. That means that there would be four degrees of warming at 16, CO2 having doubled four times. Linear interpolation, which is what Pro did, between 1 and 16 says that there should be (1/15) of the 4 degrees, 0.27 degree, at 2 units. In fact, there was 1 degree of increase at the 2 unit point, four times as much as linear interpolation erroneously yields. The temperature rise is not line between 1 and 2 or between 2 and 4, or anywhere on the curve. I converted the combined effect of climate sensitivity and CO2 increase into a linear number of degrees increase per century increase. The official estimate by the US Environment Protection Agency, referencing the IPCC, is 2.2 to 6.1 degrees C by 2100. (I converted from the EPA's F) [http://www.epa.gov...] That's 2.6 to 7.1 degrees per century. The range includes both the allowed variation in the estimates of climate sensitivity and the possibility that CO2 output may drop near the end of the century, as substitutes for fossil fuels become more significant. Departure from exponential growth is in the future so I used 3 degrees per century to represent the low end of climate sensitivity estimates that AGW theory allows. It's a coincidence that matches 3 degrees for doubling CO2. The earth should have warmed by 0.4 to 1 degree since 2000, but in fact as measured by the satellites there was no change, and in all data sets show no statistically significant change. The graph shows temperature anomaly, so where the blue line ought to originate depends upon when one believes AGW began to dominate climate. AGW theory was invented to explain the temperature rise from about 1980 to 1996, so that's where I put the AGW prediction line. The Hockey stick claimed that nothing happened to climate for a thousand years before about 1970. If the claim is that AGW dominated the entire 20th century, then the line should start at 1900. If climate sensitivity is 0.7, way below any AGW official estimate, then the line is about 0.5 degree per century. and AGW no longer explains the rise in the 80s and 90s. Wrong consensus derives from common error When science reaches a wrong consensus, scientists point to the data that they used to proclaim that the wrong consensus is well founded. I gave several examples. For AGW, it was the rapid temperature increase in the 80s and 90s that “proved” the theory. Some AGW is in the climate, but the long pause proves it is not the dominant factor. Paleoclimate In the hundred million year history of climate, CO2 shows no relation to temperature. The laws of nature do not change. It's not enough to say that things were different back then. The changes in the orbit of the earth were too small to explain the climate variation. The likely missing link is the solar variation other than heat output that caused the MWP. CO2 released from the ocean will increase heating, and CO2 going back into solution will amplify cooling. Those are natural, not anthropogenic, factors and they do nothing to explain what drives the trend in either direction. (I wrongly identified my reference for the lag in CO2; it's 3-5.) The Debate Pro's rules for the debate say that we have an equal burden to prove that AGW does or not dominate climate. That's fine with me. If AGW was the dominant factor in climate, then we should have observed a straight line increase in temperature since 1980, and we clearly have not. Since Pro has not met his burden of showing that AGW dominates, I've met my burden to show it has not. Thanks to Pro for a fine debate. It will be most fascinating to people interested in logarithms.</h>

    <t>AGW exists, it but doesn't dominate climate Greenhouse gases cause warming, and I never claimed otherwise. Pro cited a skeptical climate scientist acknowledgment that AGW plays some role in climate. Our resolution is “Global warming is man made.” That might mean that global warming is entirely man made, in which case Pro has conceded it is not, because he has acknowledged that there are also natural causes. I didn't take that meaning. I said repeatedly that Pro must prove that climate is dominated by AGW. I must prove it does not. The proof of AGW would be a AGW math mathematical model of climate that accurately explains and predicts. Weather effects are yearly variations; climate comprises trends over several years. The AGW models fail because the models do not predict or explain climate the large trends in climate. For example, Pro acknowledges that Medieval Warm Period was due to solar activity, but the official IPCC models have no mechanism that explains the MWP. Because AGW models cannot explain the MWP, climate crisis advocates have fought consistently to make the MWP disappear as a global climate phenomena. The Hockey Stick got rid of it by a statistical error, but the data ultimately won. A change in climate acknowledged to be very close to modern warming is unexplained by the models we are supposed to accept as reliable. The pause in global warming is real Pro argued that an 17 year pause in global warming might just be “noise,” and he cited a scientific paper that allegedly shows that. That's bad science. Suppose an engineer designed a building taking into account all the other factors he knew to affect design, and the building subsequently collapsed. Consider: “The design models were correct. The building collapsed due to unknown factors categorized as noise. There is no need for further explanation.” Nonsense. Fundamental failures are not noise. An eighteen year failure of climate prediction shows that the model is defective. Since AGW is in the model, and something else canceled it, the unknown factor dominated climate over the period. I quoted both HADCru and NASA scientists as acknowledging the pause in global warming. The paper by AGW-advocate von Storch established that the current models cannot be tweaked to explain the pause.

    <t>== Roy’s calculation ==   Roy’s assumption that warming is linear is simply untrue:  Even though CO2 is the dominant climate driver of modern climate-change, it does not mean natural climate variability cannot occur in the system—it does occur. A few ‘pauses’ or unprecedented accelerations do occur. CO2 is logarithmic in relation to temperature. This means that every CO2 doubling has the same effect, even though each molecule warms less. For example, a doubling from 100 ppm to 200 ppm would have the same effect as a doubling from 280 to 560 ppm. Warming will only occur fairly linearly if each doubling occurs at the same rate.  His calculation uses faulty assumptions. His 3 degrees C slope is from my former argument that CO2 sensitivity is around 3 degrees C. Sensitivity is for each CO2 doubling.  His line begins in about 1970, and CO2 has not doubled from 1970 to now (in terms of the pre-industrial levels). In 1970 there was about 323 ppm of CO2, and in 2014 the number is around 400 [1][2]. So over that time period, CO2 increased 77 ppm. That would only be about 13.2% of a CO2 doubling. So .132 * 3 is about .4 degrees temperature rise since 1970. It has warmed about 0.5 degrees since the 1970s [3]. Therefore when Roy’s calculation is done correctly, CO2 is responsible for 80% of the temperature rise over that time period.    == Climate model accuracy ==    Roy argues that global circulation models (GCMs) are inaccurate. This is untrue. Climate models actually have accurately reproduced temperature since 1900. GCMs cannot replicate warming without a CO2 forcing.  GCM’s are only accurate when CO2 forcing is accounted for in  hindcasts. This means that CO2 is a large forcing of modern climate. This can be demonstrated with the following graph [4]:   Models also reproduced temperatures after the Mt. Pinatubo eruption. They correctly predicted the temporary 0.5 degrees C cooling after the eruption, meaning models can replicate temperature changes due to aerosol and sulfate forcings [4].  A paper published in Nature looked at each 15 year period since the 1950s. Their models were able to accurately produce those trends as well as many El Nino events. The study even commented on the pause. The authors note that the pause does not falsify model accuracy, as it is only “one realization where the decadal natural variability component of the model climate is generally not in phase with observations” [5]. In other words, it is the exception rather than the rule. Models accurately predict warming trends, one exception does not falsify the models. In fact, they note models still were able to predict recent trends in the Pacific—a huge portion of the world.  Hansen’s 1988 model, unlike what skeptics claim, shows close correspondence with the actual temperature change. His model seemingly assumes more warming due to the fact he assumed 25% too much climate sensitivity. When the sensitivity is lowered to 3 degrees C, his scenario B correlates perfectly with observed temperatures [6]. The model offers evidence of a 3 degrees C climate sensitivity. Models can accurately hindcast warming which occurred in the last century and models can accurately predict the cooling forcings of aerosols. Further, the 1988 model predictions were correct, indicating that models can predict future temperatures.    == The ‘pause’ ==    The argument that the ‘pause’ disproves global warming is incorrect. The fact that other forcings can *temporarily* blunt the warming effect of CO2 is not a nail in the coffin. Unless Roy denies the greenhouse effect, it is preposterous to claim that CO2 cannot influence temperatures. The fact that natural forcings have caused a short-term ‘pause’ does not disprove AGW. Some models actually have predicted the ‘pause’ [7].   The Met Office has released a report regarding the ‘pause’. They note that the earth’s heat content is still increasing, and is actually increasing faster than ever before. Surface warming has slowed due to the fact that the oceans have been accumulating more heat. This effect is temporary. Eventually, the ocean’s heat content will ‘max out’, and surface warming will resume. So CO2 is still warming the climate system [8]. As noted, this effect is temporary, and as heat continues to accumulate the  oceans will warm, and surface temperatures will eventually begin to increase. CO2 forcing has not stopped—its heat is merely being distributed elsewhere.  The earth’s surface has stopped warming not due to CO2 not being a greenhouse gas, but rather its heat content being distributed elsewhere. There is still doubt as to whether or not the ‘pause’ is real (as I noted last round).  Tamino, a statistician, has worked out the data. Using each possible start date for the ‘pause’, he ran the p-value of statistical significance. For each start date, none of them reach the 95% statistical significance level. Therefore, no matter which data-set you use, no matter what start date you use, there is no proof of a statistically significant slowdown in global temperatures. The following chart [9] details the results:   Therefore, there is little proof that a ‘pause’ is occurring at all.    == Solar activity ==   Roy argues the sun caused the LIA and the MWP. I agree! CO2 was fairly stable in those time periods, so it could not have been the forcing. Climate reacts to whatever is forcing it to change at the time. As I convincingly argued (CON’s words), the sun cannot be the current forcing. CO2 has been increasing, and likely is the current climate forcing. I never said that the sun couldn’t affect climate. I merely stated that cosmic rays do not change the climate, and that the sun is not the driver of current climate change. As noted, solar forcing has been decreasing, meaning it cannot be the cause of modern warming.   TSI has been falling, GCR’s have been increasing, and solar cycle lengths have fallen as temperature dramatically increased. The sun cannot be the forcing behind the current warming—it is impossible. I have cited many peer-reviewed studies corroborating those conclusions.    == Paleoclimate ==   This entire argument proved that CO2 has the potential to change climate. CON claims I said CO2 does not correlate with temperature. This is a massive misinterpretation. I first cited the study which every paleoclimatologist uses in their datasets, the GEOCARB study. The study found that CO2 did correlate with temperature. I then cited Royer 2006, which noted how CO2 does correlate with temperature when 1) pH effects are corrected for, and 2) the sun is accounted for. The sun does not correlate with temperatures, but it obviously affects climate. It only correlates with temperatures when CO2 forcing is included. Therefore, we can conclude that CO2 is one of the main drivers of past climate. This proves that CO2 has the ability to warm the planet, meaning the increased emissions have had a warming effect.  Research using proxy data over the last 500 million years find a climate sensitivity of 3 degrees C [9]. This supports the idea that the modern increase of CO2 concentrations are having a large effect on modern climate.  Roy again claims the CO2 lag refutes AGW. I already responded to this. CO2 has lagged temperatures over the previous interglacial periods, I agree. But CO2 acts as an amplifier in those conditions. If CO2 amplifies temperature, it has a warming effect. If it has a warming effect, it can be a forcing. Therefore, CO2 has an effect on temperature, and can be the driving force behind modern climate change. The lag argument was solidly refuted last round.  Roy also dropped my argument about CO2 causing the end of the last ice-age. This argument definitively proves that CO2 has a massive impact on temperatures.  The fact that it is warmer now than in the MWP demonstrates that the current warming is unprecedented. I have proven that the modern warm period is warmer now than at any point during the past 2000+years.    == Burden of proof ==    Roy claims I have not proven AGW. This is incorrect.  When it comes to sensitivity, CO2 has a *direct* effect on temperature: each doubling causes about 1.1 degrees C warming. Using calculations from a skeptical physicist [10], this direct effect means that CO2 has caused over 50% of the recent warming. Sensitivity is likely much higher, about 3 degrees C. With higher sensitivity, CO2 causes more warming. This is corroborated with studies using many different methods. With the high sensitivity proven (R1), CO2 is the main factor of modern climate change. Roy dropped this argument.  I proved there was a scientific consensus. This suggests the empirical evidence almost certainly corroborates AGW theory. I proved that CO2 is one of the main forcings in past climate. This is important because it dispels any doubts that CO2 has a large warming potential. In fact, paleoclimate proves 3 degrees sensitivity. Therefore, this also proves that CO2 is the main driver of modern climate change.  I have proven that CO2 does change climate. The direct effect of CO2 (which no one disputes) causes over 50% of climate change, and when sensitivity is 3 degrees C, CO2 is the cause of the warming since 1970. I have upheld the BOP. Roy, on the other hand, has failed to explain *why* CO2 is either not a forcing, or that my sensitivity estimate is wrong. He drops the sensitivity argument, conceding that CO2 is the main driver of warming in the modern era. His alternative explanation, the sun, was eviscerated last round. His arguments about a ‘pause’ are also put into question, and his model argument is based upon flawed assumptions. I have, on many occasions, cited Roy’s evidence against him. Low sensitivity proves AGW, high sensitivity proves AGW, and Roy totally ignored that key point. Therefore, I have proven that AGW exists, whereas Roy fails to put a dent into the extremely well supported theory.    Thanks for the debate, Roy, it was fun! Please, vote PRO!</t>

    <t>I would like to thank TylerGraham95 for this truly excellent debate. I've learned a lot from your arguments and my own research. In this round, I will consider the objections my opponent has to my arguments. The Sun My opponent is making two mistakes. One in thermodynamics, and the other in how solar activity is measured. Solar activity is the highest is about 8000 years. Here is a graph showing sunspot number over the past 10000 years:   [1] While solar activity has decreased, it is still at a very high level compared to recent times in the Earth's history. This means that the temperature will still increase because solar activity is still historically high. Even on the scale of the 20th century, solar activity is high.“Clearly the sun’s activity and output experienced an upwards step-change around 1950. The average monthly sunspots in the second half of the century were, for example, 50% higher than in the first half of the century.” Overall, because solar activity is still high in comparison, temperatures continue to increase.[2] As for the error in how solar activity is measured, “Since the late 1970s, the amount of solar radiation the sun emits, during times of quiet sunspot activity, has increased by nearly .05 percent per decade... This trend is important because, if sustained over many decades, it could cause significant climate change... TSI [Total Solar Irradiance] interaction with the Earth's atmosphere, oceans and landmasses is the biggest factor determining our climate.” So there's still more solar radiation reaching Earth than earlier.[3] See this graph:   It shows a peak right at the time that temperature was increasing quickly, and decreases right before the temperature decrease (see below). Finally, consider the global temperature stagnation over the last 15 years. If the satellite based temperature is considered (which starts in the 1970s) there is an unmistakable pause in global warming starting around 2000:   [4] Overall, thermodynamics, how solar activity should really be measured, and the pause in global warming all show how the sun is still the dominant factor determining the climate. The Hockey Stick The hockey stick is wildly inaccurate: “The dataset used to make this construction contained collation errors, unjustified truncation or extrapolation of source data, obsolete data, incorrect principal component calculations, geographical mislocations and other serious defects. These errors and defects substantially affect the temperature index. The major finding is that the values in the early 15th century exceed any values in the 20th century. The particular hockey stick shape derived in the MBH98 proxy construction a temperature index that decreases slightly between the early 15th century and early 20th century and then increases dramatically up to 1980 is primarily an artefact of poor data handling, obsolete data and incorrect calculation of principal components.”[5][6] Temperatures have been warmer than today as recently as 1300 ACE.'During the Medieval Warming... . Temperatures may have been as much as 2.5 degrees C warmer [than today] due to a southward shift of the climate belts.'[7] This graph shows the hockey stick graph and the corrected version of it:   Cosmic Rays My opponent's whole argument against cosmic rays is one whole quote that provides no evidence for its conclusion. I have made a sufficient case for how cosmic rays amplify the sun's effects on the climate, and my opponent has not touched it. As for the Forbes source (I contend that Popsci isn't bad, but I'll leave that alone to save space), thank you for pointing that out. That was part of a two-year old argument that I need to get rid of. Here is a better source: “Ironically, solar explosions, which produce their own deadly radiation, sweep away the even deadlier cosmic rays. As flares subside, cosmic rays intensify.” Further, this Nature study shows how cosmic rays cause cloud formation (source 9). I feel like I've supported my cloud argument enough, and with good sources to preclude me from having to post more on that matter.[8][9] To conclude, here's a graph:   [5]The bottom graph corrects for a few variables, so it shows a better correlation.  Extraterrestrial Warming I've addressed the argument about solar irradiance, and the source I posted showed how all the planets were warming. Unfortunately, there's not enough evidence on this, but there's sufficient evidence that Mars, the Moon, Jupiter, Pluto, and Neptune are warming, and indirect evidence that the other planets are warming. This shows the comparison between the Sun's, the Earth's, and Neptune's activity:   [5]Noitce how they all follow the same pattern, which shows they're connected.  I need to develop my argument more in other places, so considering my opponent doesn't consider this argument much either, I'll leave it at this. Source 10 (one of the blogs my opponent says is invalid) contains peer-reviewed articles of that evidence, however.[10][11] The Sun, Cosmic Rays, and the Evidence for Natural Warming 'In particular, a quasi-60-year large cycle is quite evident since 1650 in all climate and astronomical records herein studied ... The existence of a natural 60-year cyclical modulation of the global surface temperature induced by astronomical mechanisms, by alone, would imply that at least 60 to 70% of the warming observed since 1970 has been naturally induced.'[12][13] 'For example, the authors of a paper by NASA's JPL remark '...has compared the minimum aa [index of geomagnetic activity] values with the Earth's surface temperature record and found a correlation of 0.95 between the two data sets starting in 1885. The solar irradiance [solar activity] proxy developed from the aa minima continues to track the Earth's surface temperature until the present.''[14][15] As for Scafetta and West, the paper my opponent cites acknowledges that there might be a non-CO2 reason why this is true. See the whole paragraph after my opponent's quote in my source 16 (his source 3 from round 3). Further, they argue in a different article that “...the current anthropogenic contribution to global warming is significantly overestimated. We estimate that the Sun could account for as much as 69% [from a different starting year] the increase in Earth's average temperature, depending on the TSI reconstruction used.” Overall, my opponent's argument against this study does not hold water.[16][17] A solar explanation for the recent global warming is the only one that agrees with its predictions and the observations made. The actual scientific data does not agree with him. Attack on Opponent's Sources My source 3 also says this: “[Fred] Singer counters the standard scientific stance that changes in solar activity are not significant enough to have an effect, stating that solar variability is much greater in ultraviolet regions, thus having a significant effect on ozone levels and consequently a major impact on atmospheric circulation.” It takes an objective standpoint (it doesn't take sides), and I was only citing it to show the solar cycle length/temperature correlation. Singer has a PhD in physics (he's reliable). I've already conceded my sources 5 and 6 and have exchanged them for better ones. Again, thank you for calling me out on it. Watts Up With That is a bit complicated. For one, while it's run by Anthony Watts, most of the articles are by guest authors, often with degrees explaining their papers, or use reputable sources if written by Watts. You can take a look at each individual article for yourself and see that they have substantiation. Further, “Patrick J. Michaels, climatologist and contributor to the IPCC first assessment report, described WUWT as part of a new 'parallel universe' of emerging online publications, manned by serious scientists critical of world governments approach to climate change: 'A parallel universe is assembling itself parallel to the IPCC. This universe has become very technical – very proficient at taking apart the U.N.'s findings.'” Michaels has a PhD in environmental climatology.[18][19] The book Unstoppable Global Warming: Every 1,500 Years is very reliable. It contains 499 studies for substantiation, including a large number substantiating the quotes I made. While past climactic conditions don't negate AGW, if there were periods in recent history that were much hotter and warmed much quicker than the recent global warming, that throws suspicion and the supposed remark-ability of the recent global warming. It also provides evidence for a solar explanation and against an anthropogenic explanation. Sources 9 and 11 do provide reliable sources, and source 9 itself looks pretty good. I'll concede source 12, but I feel the quote I quoted from it makes general sense. Source 20 provides a better source for that quote (regarding the distribution of solar radiation).[20] Finally, now my own attack on one of my opponent's sources – Skeptical Science. Just to take one example, “The fact that there has been no statistically-significant global warming for 16 years is described as a “myth”. Yet the least-squares linear-regression trend on the Hadley Centre/CRU dataset favoured by the IPCC indeed shows no statistically-significant warming for 16 years.” I've shown this above. There's a list of 11 more points in source 21.[21] Also from that source, “Yet half of the 129 signatories are Professors; two-thirds are PhDs, and several are Expert Reviewers for the IPCC’s forthcoming Fifth Assessment Report.” Another confirmation on WUWT.[21] Conclusion I have shown how a solar cause to the recent global warming is the only reasonable explanation, much better than a human-caused greenhouse gas cause. The latter theory simply has too many problems with it to hold any water, while the former's case is practically airtight, save an exact description of how the sun affects the climate. It is known that it does, however, even recently. Overall, mankind is not the main cause of global warming. Sources Sources in comments.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank tylergraham95 for presenting his well-thought out arguments. In this round, I will post arguments against an anthropogenic cause to the recent global warming, and also consider as much as I can of my opponent's argument. Arguments Against Human-Caused Global Warming There are many indicators that point to CO2 emissions not being the cause of the modern global warming.First, CO2 is actually a lagging indicator compared to temperature. As it turns out, temperature may be what's causing CO2 levels to rise. 'The most recent study on this concluded that the results of their tedious but meticulous analysis led them to ultimately conclude that 'the CO2 increase lagged Antarctic deglacial warming by 800 +/- 200 years.' There is also shorter correlations, but again, temperature seems to cause CO2 rise instead of the reverse.[1][2]This graph shows just one of the lags:   Second, according to the greenhouse effect, global warming should be starting from the lower atmosphere and moving to the surface (because the CO2 collects in the upper troposphere first). However, this is not happening. '...satellite and high-altitude balloon data confirm that the lower atmosphere is not trapping lots of additional heat due to higher CO2 concentrations. It is hard to know how fast the Earth's highly variable surface is warming, but it is warming faster than the lower atmosphere where the CO2 is accumulating. This is strong evidence that CO2 is not the primary climate factor.'[3]Here is a graph showing how the surface has warmed more than the troposphere:   (The blue line is lower tropospheric temperatures)Third, global warming is not starting at the poles like it should be, by the greenhouse theory. In fact, there has been general, relative cooling: 'If the greenhouse theory were valid, temperatures in the Arctic and the Antarctic would have risen several degrees Celsius since 1940 due to the huge emissions of man-made CO2... Recently, a team led by the University of Chicago's Peter Doran published a paper in Nature saying, 'Although previous reports suggest recent continental warming, our spatial analysis of Antarctic meteorological data demonstrates a net cooling on the Antarctic continent between 1966 and 2000'. The data from 21 Antarctic surface stations show an average continental decline of 0.008 degrees C from 1978 to 1998, and the infrared data from satellites operating since 1979 show a decline of 0.42 degrees C per decade. David W. J. Thompson of Colorado State University and Susan Soloman of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration also report a cooling trend in the Antarctic interior.'[3][4]To illustrate, here is a picture of the southern hemisphere sea ice anomaly, which shows that southern sea ice is actually increasing: [5] Fourth, current levels of CO2 have very little effect on temperature. The greenhouse effect certainly exists, but it doesn't become linearly stronger with increasing amounts of CO2. CO2's effect on temperature is logarithmic, meaning that each additional increase has a smaller effect on the climate than the last. 'The carbon that is already up in the atmosphere absorbs most of the light it can. CO2 only soaks up its favorite wavelengths of light and it's close to its saturation point. It manages to grab a bit more light from wavelengths that are close to its favorite bands but it can't do much more, because there are not many left-over photons at the right wavelengths.' This has to do with how CO2's absorption spectrum overlaps with water vapor's.[1][6][7]This chart shows approximately the effect that each additional increment of CO2 increase has on temperature: Note how the pre-industrial to modern level increase has had less than a 0.2 C increase in temperature.Fifth and most importantly, the predicted 'hot-spot' 10 miles above the tropics that would be a signature of CO2-induced global warming is absent. 'The computer models show that greenhouse warming will cause a hot-spot at an altitude between 8 and 12 km over the tropics between 30 N and 30 S. The temperature at this hot-spot is projected to increase at a rate of two to three times faster than at the surface. However, the Hadley Centre's real-world plot of radiosonde temperature observations shown below does not show the projected CO2 induced global warming hot-spot at all. The predicted hot-spot is entirely absent from the observational record. This shows that atmosphere warming theory programmed into climate models are wrong.'[1]Here is the plot of predicted temperature changes due to CO2:   However, here is the actual observed temperature changes:   The hot spot is completely missing, which is pretty much a knockout blow to the anthropogenic global warming theory. However, the correlation isn't even there. See the below graph:   In case the graph's methodology is questioned, consider this: “The Carboniferous Period and the Ordovician Period were the only geological periods during the Paleozoic Era when global temperatures were as low as they are today. To the consternation of global warming proponents, the Late Ordovician Period was also an Ice Age while at the same time CO2 concentrations then were nearly 12 times higher than today-- 4400 ppm. According to greenhouse theory, Earth should have been exceedingly hot. Instead, global temperatures were no warmer than today. Clearly, other factors besides atmospheric carbon influence earth temperatures and global warming.”[8] Surely these periods should have been warmer. Surely some other factor did not outweigh CO2 by that much. Even climate sensitivity cannot account for something as drastic as that. Further, CO2 concentrations have been much higher - as much as 7000 ppm in the Cambrian period. I'm not going to argue that humans have not caused the CO2 increase, but it kind of shows how an increase of 100 ppm is rather insignificant. Even if the graph is analyzed, the correlation just isn't there. Even so, again, CO2 seems to lag temperature changes anyway. As for humidity, it is, in fact, decreasing. “This shows that the actual water vapor content in the upper troposphere has declined by 13.7% (best fit line) from 1948 to 2012 at the 400 mb pressure level. The climate models predict that humidity will increase in the upper troposphere, but the data shows a large decrease; just where water vapor changes have the greatest effect on global temperatures.”[1] This graph shows this:   The two feedbacks, water vapor feedback and cloud feedback, are weak. The fact that humidity is decreasing negates the former. However, even if the humidity were increasing, more lower level clouds would form, which block sunlight from reaching the Earth, essentially negating the warming effect of the water vapor. Further, while higher numbers of cirrus clouds (which supposedly would increase in the scenario) cause warming, what has actually been found was that cirrus clouds were decreasing in number. “What we found in month-to-month fluctuations of the tropical climate system was a strongly negative feedback. As the tropical atmosphere warms, cirrus clouds decrease. That allows more infrared heat to escape from the atmosphere into outer space...'it would reduce estimates of future warming by over 75 percent.”[1][9][10] Finally, global warming is not happening unbelievably fast. “Temperature changes recorded in the GISP2 ice core ... show that the global warming experienced during the past century pales into insignificance when compared to the magnitude of profound climate reversals over the past 25,000 years. In addition, small temperature changes of up to a degree or so, similar to those observed in the 20th century record, occur persistently throughout the ancient climate record.”[1][11] This graph shows this:   It doesn't look different than all the rest of the warmings. It even looks rather moderate. The Consensus The problem with any consensus argument, no matter how strong, is that science does not work by consensus. Michael Crichton has said, “Consensus is the business of politics. Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world. In science consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus.”[1] There have been many false consensuses in history. Heliocentrism, evolution, the big bang theory, continental drift, and even climate change itself used to be ridiculed by the majority of scientists. There's no reason why this consensus should be believed above all of the other false ones. Even so, the consensus is based off of a misrepresentation of the data, and a selective look at studies. Over 31,000 scientists (with at least a Bachelors' degree in relevant fields, and over 9000 PhDs) have signed a petition saying that global warming is not anthropogenic. “Only 41 out of the 11,944 published climate papers Cook examined explicitly stated that Man caused most of the warming since 1950. Cook himself had flagged just 64 papers as explicitly supporting that consensus, but 23 of the 64 had not in fact supported it. A book I own (but unfortunately don't have access to at this moment) cites over 500 studies that don't believe in the whole global warming edifice, showing various inconsistencies in the hockey stick graph (i.e. the 1500-year cycle), that the sun causes global warming, and that CO2 cannot be causing global warming, other things.[3][12][13][14] Conclusion There are many arguments against the anthropogenic global warming theory, and there are many problems with the assumptions it makes. The consensus is based off of a false understanding of how scientific hypotheses are supported, and isn't even true anyway. Overall, the anthropogenic global warming theory does not hold water against its own assumptions and predictions. Sources Sources in comments.</t>

    <t>Thanks to subutai for posting an excellent opening round! I'm looking forward to this debate, as I am sure it will be an interesting one!So to kick this thing off I'd like to start by providing the readers with a quick road map of my case and how I aim to negate the given resolution.What I am going to do is set up the basis of a cause effect relationship between greenhouse gases (Such as CO2, Methane, and Water Vapor) and a warming trend, and then confirm this relationship with corroborating corollaries. This will prove that increased atmospheric GHG concentrations to create a warming effect on the climate.Next, I will begin to discuss why humanities effect on the climate creates an increased concentration of atmospheric greenhouse gases, thus creating an anthropogenic cause for global warming.Then, I will establish why the current warming trend cannot be due primarily to natural causes.Finally, to seal in these arguments, I will discuss the consensus of the scientific community as a whole regarding anthropogenic global warming.Con's CaseI. The Greenhouse effect and Greenhouse GasesTo begin, let's examine what exactly makes a green house gas, a green house gas. Everyone has likely heard of the most common GHGs: Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), and Water Vapor (H2O). Why, though, do these gases cause a warming effect, while the gases most prevalent in our atmosphere, Nitrogen and Oxygen, cause no warming? A) Di-pole momentExamine the following diagram describing the molecular structures of the gases above. So here we have CO2, Methane, Water Vapor, Nitrogen, and Oxygen in either 3d models, or Lewis structures. The thing we must pay closest attention to is their molecular shape (VSEPR Theory). Carbon Dioxide is bent. Methane is tetrahedral. H2O is Bent. Nitrogen and oxygen, however, are Linear diatomic molecules [1].Now, every element has a different level of electronegativity. In an atom with an electronegativity disparity, a dipole moment forms [2]. This is essentially the formation of a magnetic field direction. CO2 and H2O due to their bent asymmetrical shapes have Dipole moments. The dipole moment 'points' from the more electronegative towards the less electronegative. More +--gt; LessWhen an atom is struck by particular wavelengths of infrared light, the bonds in the atom begin to 'vibrate' there are many kinds of vibration that can occur (bending, stretching, etc). [3] This causes the molecules to shift around, and in greenhouse gases, the dipole moment is shifted. Now atoms like N2 and O2 have no dipole moment, and no amount of shifting disrupts their symmetry. CO2 and H2O always have their dipole moment shifted by molecular vibration. Methane, due to the complexity of tetrahedral molecular shape, can undergo several vibrations that disrupt the symmetry of the molecule, and cause dipole moments to form.When a dipole moment is shifted or formed, much energy is released as heat. This is what happens in greenhouse gases [4].This is why greenhouse gases heat the earth when they are present in the atmosphere. Light from the sun strikes the molecule, and the infrared spectra that result in molecular vibration release heat energy into the atmosphere. Every single one of the billions of GHGs in the atmosphere are each acting as individual heat generators, catching and trapping energy from the sun, and heating the earth.B) Corollaries (Paleoclimate)Paleoclimates have historically been a major focal point of many debates on anthropogenic global warming. Therefore, I will preempt these arguments, so that time may be saved in the rebuttals. I will also reestablish the cause that I have described previously, and corroborate through corollaries.Many climate change skeptics have claimed that there is 'No historic correlation' between the presence of green-house gases and global temperature. According to Royers 2006 [4] the data previously observed on the phanerzoic era has been contaminated, as it has not been adjusted for pH, which affects the molecular shape, atmospheric concentration, dipole moment, and molecular vibration potential of CO2. Quote Royer, 'the temperature data correlate strongly with both the record of continental gla-ciation and atmospheric CO2'. Furthermore, the famous Vostok Ice Cores show that 'there is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr.' [5]During the cenzoic period as well, CO2 was the driving force of Global warming, cite Hansen and Sato [6].II. Climate Sensitivity/CarbonAnother aspect of global warming that one must consider is 'Climate sensitivity.' Climate sensitivity is essentially the amount of expected change in global temperature as a result of increased retention of radiation (via GHGs). [7] Essentially, climate sensitivity tells us how much the temperature will change, given a certain amount of CO2 concentration increase [8] [10]. The reason that certain paleoclimates were not nearly as warm given the increased concentration of CO2 was due to lower climate sensitivity [9].Current studies have established an accepted measurement of modern climate sensitivity (a range between 1-4.1 degrees Celsius per doubling of CO2). This number is accepted by both supporters and skeptics of global warming [11].Furthermore, to preempt a rebuttal on the presence of water vapor concentrations, it has been observed that global humidity is increasing [12] [13].A) Carbon Cycle, atmospheric CO2, and 'Tipping the Pot'A common rebuttal against the anthropogenic climate change case is the relative smallness of man-made CO2 compared to natural concentrations. The problem with this argument, is that it observes all carbon, rather than only atmospheric CO2. Carbon that is not in the atmosphere cannot affect climate change, and does not contribute to global warming. It can be seen that man-made CO2 almost always remains in the atmosphere, as the natural equilibrium of the earths carbon cycle is upset by the introduction of artificial CO2And now in the industrial age where CO2 is introduced into the atmosphere in a myriad of ways, we can see that atmospheric CO2 levels are at a record level.Then, as GHGs warm the Earth, positive feedback loops occur. Thus, humanity has 'tipped the pot.'B) Positive FeedbackPositive feedback comes in many forms in climate change. The problem with global warming, is that said warming can result in the death of vegetation (due to droughts) and the warming of the ocean. Both of these further reduce the maximum absorption of the Earths carbon cycle, thus resulting in even more CO2 being released into the atmosphere. [14]These kinds of emissions are referred to as 'indirect emissions' as humans did not directly produce these GHG emissions, they are directly responsible for the factors that resulted in this emission. This emission also comes from other human practices, such as deforestation, and pollution of the ocean.III. What makes anthropogenic warming different from natural warming?The key difference between the current modern global warming, and previous eras of natural warming, is that the current warming period is undoubtedly the fastest in the Earth's history. 'Carbon dioxide and other global warming pollutants are collecting in the atmosphere like a thickening blanket, trapping the sun's heat and causing the planet to warm up. Although local temperatures fluctuate naturally, over the past 50 years the average global temperature has increased at the fastest rate in recorded history.' The Global scientific community has reached a 97% consensus that the current trend cannot be accounted for by natural forces. 18 scientific associations have examined and produced data on the climate, and have stated 'Observations throughout the world make it clear that climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are the primary driver.'[15][16][17][18][19][20][21]This is not an appeal to authority, as every single one of these quotes a backed by countless empirically verified, and peer reviewed studies. This is not a claim made by a single scientist, this is an overwhelming preponderance of evidence.A) Atmospheric Carbon Levels Atmospheric carbon levels, as previously mentioned, have never been this high. Record breaking levels of CO2 (a known GHG) have acted upon the Earth. Never before have atmospheric carbon levels been seen at this level. Natural CO2 cycles cannot account for this warming. Natural warming cycles of this Earth cannot account for how rapidly the earth is heating.IIII. Preponderance of evidenceThe evidence that suggest the reality of anthropogenic is, simply put, insurmountable. The weight of the evidence collected and scrutinized that points to the reality of anthropogenic global warming, when compared to the evidence presented against is like comparing the weight of a blue whale to the weight of a vole. Consider the following famous 'Powell Charts.'Peer reviewed climatology articles 1991-2012Peer reviewed studies 2013This isn't simply just scientists saying 'I think anthropogenic global warming is real!'This is thousands of experts performing countless experiments, collecting endless data that they, as experts, have critically analyzed, and have found that the data demonstrates definitively that man-made global warming exists, and is the driving force behind climate change.SummaryThere is no room in the scientific community for climate change deniersSources in comments.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank tylergraham95 for accepting this debate. I have decided to amend my debate structure a bit to fit the purpose of this debate. This round, I will post arguments for a natural cause. In the next round, I will post arguments against an anthropogenic cause. And in the final round, I will consider the most important material from both cases. The Sun The sun is the source for all the heat that the Earth receives. It is only natural to expect that fluctuations in the climate can be determined by the amount of solar activity. Unfortunately, the solar connection to climate Is not very well understood. However, there is a number of separate pieces of evidence, both direct and indirect, that indicate that the sun is the only cause of climate change on Earth. A graph of total solar irradiance is shown below:   [1] The low periods (the first one being the Maunder minimum and the second one being the Dalton minimum) correspond to documented colder periods in human history. In fact, the time of the Maunder minimum corresponded to the little ice age, when rivers that are normally ice-free froze and snow fields remained year-round at lower altitudes.[2] The correlation between solar activity and climate continued into the 20th century, and continues to this day. There are a number of methods to measure solar activity, the best one arguably being solar cycle length. Between raw solar activity (solar irradiance) and temperature, temperature lags about 7.5-10 years behind solar irradiance because of the heat capacity of the oceans. A better representation of the sun/temperature correlation is the length of the solar cycle. 'This new parameter not only indicated a remarkably high correlation coefficient between solar activity and temperature (on the order of 0.95), but it also eliminated the problem of the 7-year lag encountered by Reid.'[3] Here is a graph showing solar cycle length against temperature:   [4] The correlation between the two is striking. There is obviously correlation. Like I said before, what is not well understood is the method of causation between the two. However, we can be certain that the sun has an obvious effect on the climate, and this is shown wonderfully above. The effect of solar activity is amplified through cosmic rays. Experiments have shown that cosmic rays increase cloud cover, that increased cloud cover lowers global temperature, and that solar activity reduces the amount of cosmic rays that strike the Earth. An experiment at CERN shows the first hypothesis: “Scientists found that when shielding was removed and natural cosmic rays allowed to hit the chamber, cloud seeding increased dramatically, and it increased substantially again when additional artificial cosmic rays were added.” Experiments in the atmosphere further confirm this: “Preliminary results show that these faux cosmic rays indeed have an effect on the atmosphere: When high energy protons stream in, production of nanometer-sized particles in the atmosphere increases by more than ten times.”[5][6] It is commonly accepted that greater amounts of clouds lower global temperature, because they block some of the solar radiation. Indeed, over the past couple of decades, cloud cover has decreased.[7] As for the final hypothesis that solar activity is correlated with cosmic rays, it is known that cosmic rays come from space, and that higher solar activity means that the sun has a stronger magnetic field, and that this stronger magnetic field deflects more of the cosmic rays reaching Earth. “Over the period between 1975 and 1989, he found cosmic rays decreased by 1.2 percent annually, amplifying the sun's change in irradiance about four-fold.”[8] This graph shows both the inverse correlation between cosmic rays and low clouds and solar activity:   [9] The effect of solar activity on the climate can be partially explained by the role of ocean currents. “This [solar activity] is the single most important cause [of ocean currents and their temperatures]. The Sun provides the bulk of the energy which drives the circulation of water in the oceans, either directly or indirectly (through winds). The uneven distribution of solar energy across the globe (highest at the equator, decreasing towards the poles) produces an uneven heating of water in the ocean.”[12] The r^2 correlation between ocean current anomalies and temperature is 0.83, which is considered a good correlation, and considering ocean current's dependence on the solar cycle (which is rather similar to the 27-year solar cycle, I might add), this proves yet another piece of evidence linking solar activity with the climate.[13] Here is a graph showing ocean current anomalies compared with temperature:   [13] Another piece of evidence in favor of a solar cause to global warming is an analysis of other bodies in the solar system, for if the Earth is warming, shouldn't the other bodies in the solar system also be warming? “In 2005 data from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor and Odyssey missions revealed that the carbon dioxide 'ice caps' near Mars's south pole had been diminishing for three summers in a row. Habibullo Abdussamatov, head of space research at St. Petersburg's Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory in Russia, says the Mars data is evidence that the current global warming on Earth is being caused by changes in the sun.”[10] This is not just an isolated incident. Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Io, Europa, Ganymede, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Trition, and Pluto have all shown signs that they are warming (if I have space in my round 4 argument, I'll elaborate on this).[11] “If the Scafetta and West analysis used the uncontaminated satellite data since 1980, the results would show that the Sun has contributed at least 75% of the global warming of the last century.” And this is just a minimum estimate. If this is true (which it seems like it is considering the arguments above), the debate has already been decided. The 1500-Year Cycle In addition to cycles of interglacials and ice ages, there seems to be a 1500-year climate cycle, where the climate goes from a period of warmer temperature, to a period of colder temperature, and back again to a period of warmer temperature, the entire process taking 1500 years to repeat. Where do these cycles come from? There's no 1500 year solar cycle. However, there are 87 and 210 solar cycles, and superimposing the two cycles produces the 1500 year cycle.[14] This graph shows the most recent 1500-year cycle:   Many of the previous warmings (the Minoan warming, Roman warming, and Medieval warming), were as warm, if not warmer than the current climate. This, combined with the correlation evidence between solar activity and the climate, indicates that the current episode of global warming is nothing more than another cycle of the 1500-year cycle. There are numerous pieces of evidence for each of these warmings, as well as illustrations of the cycle. One such piece of evidence is, “The scientists found evidence that on average, every 1,470 years, plus or minus 500 years, cold, ice-bearing waters, which today circulate around southern Greenland, pushed as far south as Great Britain.”[8] There seems to be a full cycle of up-down-up temperatures of the climate every 1470 years. And this goes as far back as at least 1 million years ago. Currently, we are in an upswing of temperatures, just coming off of the Little Ice Age, the peak to be in a few hundred years, making the peak-to-peak difference between today's global warming and the Medieval Warm Period a little less than 1500 years. So today's Global Warming is a natural, cyclical occurrence. Conclusion Global warming is caused by an increase in solar activity. There is both correlation and causation between solar activity and global temperature. The sun's effects on cosmic rays amplify the correlation, and the ocean current's cycles and correlation with temperature back up the idea. This hypothesis is backed up further by evidence that other bodies in the solar system are warming. The climate of the Earth fluctuates in 1500-year cycles, that correspond to a superposition of solar cycles. The Sun has been more active in the last 100 years than in the last 500, and this is exemplified in the fact that we are going through a warm period. There's perfectly good reason to suppose that the current warming, similar to all the other previous warmings in magnitude and initial conditions (solar activity) was caused by the sun. In the next round, I will present arguments against an anthropogenic cause to global warming.</t>

    <t>Thanks again to Subutai for allowing me to take on this challenge! I've enjoyed the debate we've had throroughly.For this round, I will go through my opponents rebuttalls, and defend my case against them, and then make my closing statements.A) CO2 Lag in temperature changesSo the first problem we should address with this rebuttal is that it implies that I am trying to prove that GHGs are the driving force behind all forms of climate change. This is not the case. Climate shift, historically, has been/can be driven by several factors, usually multiple acting at once. What I can and have proven, though, is that CO2 and other GHGs have been a factor in the majority of climate shifts, historically, and that modern global warming can be explained only by the increase of atmospheric CO2 due to anthropogenic influences.So, let's examine my opponents source number 2 for round 3. He attempts to demonstrate that CO2 increases have lagged warming, and therefore  CO2 cannot be the cause of modern warming. This is not so. In fact, the very source he cited (source 2 round 3 [1]) states that though the warming may have been initiated by another factor in climate shift, the sudden increase of CO2 from positive feedback amplified the warming effect massively.This is corroborated by cross-reference with my arguments regarding the phanerzoic era, and positive feedback loops in CO2 release. 'When the Earth comes out of an ice age, the warming is not initiated by CO2 but by changes in the Earth's orbit. The warming causes the oceans to release CO2. TheCO2 amplifies the warming and mixes through the atmosphere, spreading warming throughout the planet. So CO2 causes warming AND rising temperature causes CO2rise.  Overall, about 90% of the global warming occurs after the CO2 increase.' [2] 'If you actually read the papers, which claim there to be a lag, they almost all note how CO2 acts as an amplifier and how the results do not contradict AGW. There is new research (Shakun et al.), which argued that CO2 preceded the end of the last ice age, and may have (in part) led to the warm interglacial in which we live today. The following graph from the study demonstrates how CO2 may have been an important factor in the most recent deglaciation:' [3] The truth is that sometimes small amounts of warming are intitiated, and then CO2 release into the atmosphere causes massive warming. This can be misconstrued to say that other forms of climate forcing could be present, but analysis of paleoclimate data, and the factors that are forcing the climate currently, it can be seen that Anthropogenic CO2 release can be the only explanatory factor of modern global warming, despite CO2 lag. [4][5][6][7][8]B) Troposphere climate data.The rebuttal to this argument is simple. The data my opponent cites is, simply, incorrect. 'Satellite measurements do show warming in the Tropsphere when a cooling bias from the Stratosphere is removed. Warming trends agree well with surface temperatures and model predictions except near the Poles. Differences between various analyses are largely due to analysis techniques and compensations for satellite data issues.' [9]The data displayed, though not cited, by my opponent is based largely on Spencer and Christy 1992, which used collection methods that have since been significantly improved upon, and the modern satallite data collected shows us that the earth as a whole is indeed warming. [10] C) South Pole is cooling.Again, this is a false leap my opponent is begging you to make. He claims that ice is increasing in the south pole, and then states that it is therefore cooling. Cooling is not indicitive of increased ice formation. That is simply not true. The southern ocean has recorded to be warming. [11]The increase in ice anomaly is due only to a complex mixture of changing currents (brought on by global warming) and the hole in the ozone layer. [12][13]D) CO2 is saturatedThis argument is fairly weak, as the myth that CO2 saturation can occur has been debunked. The opposite has been conclusively proven with empiric evidence. The idea that CO2 saturation can occur is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the way that the greenhouse effect occurs. 'This argument originates from Angstrom's work in 1901. We now know that the planetary energy balance is determined by the upper levels of the troposphere and that the saturation of the absorption at the central frequency does not preclude the possibility to absorb more energy.' [14]The argument that my opponent is making is ancient (over 100 years old) and has since been debunked, as the modern atmospheric warming model now accounts for the simple force of convection. Essentially, this argues that the CO2 is in the atmosphere to absorb extra heat from the sun and heat the Earth. That is not how a greenhouse works, or how the greenhouse effect occurs. When a greenhouse is heated, the glass then keeps the hot air from escaping, which causes warming. The same goes for CO2. The earth is heated, and then releases this energy in the form of black body radiation. Increased CO2 concentrations prevents this radiation from escaping at the proper rate.E) Troposphere hot-spotThis counterpoint my opponent has made is going to follow the pattern that his counter-case has followed thus far. His case is based on data that has been collected incorrectly, and proven to have been collected incorrectly. Essentially, my opponent (through no fault of his own) is citing data and sources that are patently false, and lend no water to his case.'Satellite measurements match model results apart from in the tropics. There isuncertainty with the tropic data due to how various teams correct for satellite drift. The U.S. Climate Change Science Program conclude the discrepancy is most likely due to data errors.' [15] Improved data collection has shown that the data cited by my opponent was mired with error, and that improved data collection methods demonstrate a hotspot. [16][17][18]The 'Consensus'My opponent, for whatever reason, decides to attack the recent media reports on the 'scientific consensus' on AGW. I never cited a consensus, rather I only cited thousands of empiric studies with empiric evidence in support of AGW, and asked the voters to weigh these sources against the one single report published in conflict with AGW. A concensus is apparent though, but it I do not argue that the science is clear because there is a consensus. I argue that there is a concensus because the science is clear. By my opponents line of logic, we ought to deny scientific consensus due to the rare occasion where a consensus is totally false, but this is not proper logic. The truth is when a consensus is reached in the sceintific community (post scientific revolution/enlightenment era) that the consensus is right nearly 99.999% of the time! No we shouldn't accept something as the absolute and gospel truth just because there is a consensus, but in the face of overwhelming data and testimony from experts, versus sparse data from a splinter group of deniers, the only logical and reasonable belief to side with is that of the overwhelming evidence and expertise.Therefore, you must vote CON!Sources in comments</t>

    <t>Just going to do a quick line by line.  ' Without technology, mankind would still be considered as animals trapped on a planet, unarmed and unfit to fight for survival and unable to complete even the simplest tasks. Therefore, technology brings more good than harm.'  There is literally 200,000 years of human existence and survival happened just fine before anything you'd consider technology even existed. Humans can survive on very little as evidenced by are ancestors doing it for at least 180,000 years.  'Even though mankind uses technology for some disadvantages, technology must and can be used to surpass all conflicts between one another, maintain peace throughout the globe, as the essential tool for survival, help all living creatures in the state of evolution, and teaches us the true meaning of hope'  On the contrary. Technology has made conflict easier. We can send planes across the globe to kill enemies we wouldn't even have if it weren't for us being so interconnected because of technology.  When you consider that because the world is so connected diseases like Ebola can spread across the globe faster and easier, meaning a plague could more easily destroy the worl, we have enough nukes where if we were to go to war with another nuclear powered country we could end all life on Earth.  Technology isn't our savior. It is in fact enslaving us like my last round showed and may even be the thing that wipes humanity of the face of the Earth.  'inescapable in our lives and has proved essential to mankind. Therefore, it is conclusive that humans and animals needs technology'  That's irrelevant to the resolution. The question posed is 'does it do more harm than Good', which it most certainly does not 'Is it essential for survival', which is debatable.  'Your first point ,which stated global warming was caused by technology, is in fact a probability, not conclusive. Even if technology caused the occurrence of global warming, global warming can be overcome by technology  I gave evidence to support that conclusion and you've merely asserted it's not true instead of addressing my arguments. My arguments stand and I extend them.  'One day, our societies will replace everything that pollutes to things that doesn't, from cars that runs by petrol to cars that runs by solar energy, from burning fossils to generating wing energy and many other.'  speculation, nothing to support these beliefs. This is just a bare assertion at it's finest. The trend is more pollution and global warming and I see no evidence of those trends stopping. Even so, without technology to start with global warming wouldn't be a problem.  I gave evidence for how autonomy was destroyed under my section entitled 'harm to humans'. I've shown billions of animals tortured and bad drinking water. The best pro does is show how these things can be mitigated with technology but these things are harmful no matter what</t>

    <t>Thank you for your participation in this debate.  As I have mentioned earlier, I have stated that technology is crucial to the survival of all living creatures. Technology is inescapable in our lives and has proved essential to mankind. Therefore, it is conclusive that humans and animals needs technology. Next, I will point out the faults in your points.  Your first point ,which stated global warming was caused by technology, is in fact a probability, not conclusive. Even if technology caused the occurrence of global warming, global warming can be overcome by technology. How so? Well, technology has changed when it began entering the new era of clean and sufficient energy. As we all know, scientists of today have invented solar panels and wind turbines, that supplies us clean energies, which doesn't pollutes. One day, our societies will replace everything that pollutes to things that doesn't, from cars that runs by petrol to cars that runs by solar energy, from burning fossils to generating wing energy and many other.  Besides that, you stated that many people does not have access to safe drinking water, but do you know that's a company in Switzerland invented a water filter, called the LifeStraw. It is an excellent example that technology can overcome any problems and make it better. Other than that, it is normal for humans to have farm animals as they are food to us. As your point, you said that animals were treated badly. However, little did you know, there are also animal sanctuaries and forest reserves to protect them in their natural habitats. When technology gets better, our civilizations stays in a stable position resulting mankind to be capable of compassion. That way, we get to do more than just survive, we'll be able to help others in survival, and maybe more.  Moreover, technology will never control us as technology is a part of us ever since the dawn of mankind. We earn our living with technology as our stepping stone for success and use technology to maintain peace and order. Without technology, there will be chaos and our society will never be suitable for our future generations to grow in.  Lastly, there are no evidence referring that the loss of the human autonomy was actually caused by the superior rise of technology. In fact, there are no relation between these two things. The information you gave merely explain the definition of autonomy, not how these two things relate.  In conclusion, technology can and will bring us more good than harm, and bring us hope rather than chaos.</t>

    <t>Harms caused by technology-  Damages to the environment.   A. Technology is the main factor behind global warming. We know that global warming is man made and a result of the industrial-technological revolution is because of the amount of low isotope carbon-14 found in the atmosphere. Something that mainly comes from burning fossil fuels. B. More then 14,000 people die from drinking polluted water every day [1]. Nearly half a billion people do not have access to safe drinking water [2]. I've only mentioned the human element so far. This pollution is also causing extremely harmful affects on underwater ecosystems as well. The sources of this harmful phenomenon is mostly human caused and as a result of technology. If you look at the sources of water pollution in the cited article you will come to the same conclusion [3]. Harm of the industrial-technological society on Animals.  Factory farming has reduced animals to mere cogs in the machine. Animals are out in cages that are extremely crowded . They live their whole lives barely able to move. [1] They are on many occasions force fed in a way that causes extreme damage and pain. This is just a short list of the abuse these animals take to feed the industrial-technological system. Harmful affects to humans  It's not just animals who are reduced to mere cogs in the technological society. Humans have almost lost all autonomy. We have been reduced to wage slave . Are movement is extremely controlled. We must walk on the side walk follow green lights, stop at red ones.Psychological affects on humans.  Humans have a great need for the feeling of autonomy [1]. People have fought and died for their right to have autonomy. Often when people are suffering depression they claim to feel like they have no control over the direction of their life. Autonomy is an innate human desire that isn't going away despite the fact the more the technological beast grows the more us humans lose our autonomy. CONCLUSION  Technology is destroying the environment and our freedom. Vote Con.</t>

    <t>Technology, is used around the globe, from the invention of wheels to the futuristic Google glasses. To indicate whether technology does more harm or more good, I will list out points on why technology does more good than harm.  First of all, technology can bring us one step forward towards a much better future. Technology is created ever since the existence of mankind during the prehistoric times to ease mankind in completing any difficult tasks and to expand the horizon of the impossible. Most importantly, technology is used in many ways, such as to bring mankind into deep space, discover new resources, create new cures for various diseases, and many more. Without technology, mankind would still be considered as animals trapped on a planet, unarmed and unfit to fight for survival and unable to complete even the simplest tasks. Therefore, technology brings more good than harm.  Other than that, technology is needed for survival. Mammals, such as West African chimpanzees and Brazilian capuchin monkeys, uses technology in the form of stone hammers and anvils to crack nuts for food. Besides that, beavers make dams and bees make honeycombs. These are examples of the importance of technology. Without technology, survival is a challenge for both mankind and animals. Therefore, technology is essential for survival.  Even though mankind uses technology for some disadvantages, technology must and can be used to surpass all conflicts between one another, maintain peace throughout the globe, as the essential tool for survival, help all living creatures in the state of evolution, and teaches us the true meaning of hope...</t>

    <t>Thank you Mikal, Bluesteel, and 16kadam. I want to establish, first, that this isn't a debate about Global Warming, but about Man-Made Global Warming. To prove his case, Pro must establish that Man-Made Global Warming is the threat. If he establishes that Global Warming is a threat, but can not establish that enough of it is man-made to say the threat comes from man, he can not affirm the resolution.Contention 1: Human caused Global Warming Exists.  Many Global Warming advocates state that CO2 levels are skyrocketing, but that is incorrect. I give you the above graph measuring the past 600 million years of CO2 levels, which shows we are actually at an all time low. Now the website I got this from no longer has this page up so I apologize. We can see from observance of this graph that, with us being at an all time CO2 lows, that we are nowhere close to meeting the impact that my opponent brings up. The world has had CO2 levels over 5,000 ppm, while are now currently around apprx. 350 ppm CO2 levels.  The above graph shows that comparisons of C13 (Carbon isotope) and this shows that there is little to no trend in many of these as the average is zero while the trend for all of these are zero (1). This is important as the Carbon isotope is important in measuring this so called 'Global Warming.'  This chart above shows the CO2 and Earth's temperatures for the past 600 million years. My opponent's claims are incorrect as we have had absurd levels of CO2 and let the Global Temperature never reached the extreme levels needed to prove causation on the level Pro must prove (2). Now I will move on to how Earth is actually cooling and how it's temperature is cooler than it has been.If we observe the above graph we can see that Earth has been a whole lot hotter than where we currently are to the point where the Earth's average temperature is been 7.5 °C hotter than it currently it is. You can also see that in the span of the past 10,000 years the temperature has leveled off, but you may ask yourself where does that place us in the lights of modern day?  I am going to cite Dr. Done Easterbrook, who is a climate scientist. Back in 2000 he predicted that Earth was entering a cooling phase. He predicts that for the next 20 years Earth will cool by 3/10 degree each year and that we are going to enter another little Ice Age like we did from 1650 and 1790 (3). While the IPCC, the people Pro quoted, has been wrong since just before the 2000’s, while the Earth has cooled, as Dr. Done predicted.1) Contention 2: Future Harm and sea levels. Many Warming Scientists claim that the sea level rise is due to the Arctic melting, but this is false. Al Gore stated that the Arctic Ice would be completely melted by 2014, but he is incorrect then and now.  Jan. 6, 2012: The Coast Guard Cutter Healy breaks ice around the Russian-flagged tanker Renda 250 miles south of Nome. The Healy is the Coast Guard’s only currently operating polar icebreaker. The vessels are transiting through ice up to five-feet thick in this area. The 370-foot tanker Renda will have to go through more than 300 miles of sea ice to get to Nome, a city of about 3,500 people on the western Alaska coastline that did not get its last pre-winter fuel delivery because of a massive storm (4). Let's go back to 2007-2008 and see if his claim was justified in the Arctic Ice activity.  It seems that he is incorrect, but let's look further into the near past. How about 2012-2013? (5) We all remember the Climate Scientists that got stuck in Arctic Ice Earlier this year correct? Then a Russian Ice Breaker tried to free them, but got stuck. Can you guess what they were studying? They had predicted that all the Arctic Ice had melted due to Global Warming and that Earth would get flooded massively. Boy were they wrong (6).  (7) Dr. Koonin, former head of the Department of Energy under President Obama, has stated that Global Warming is not certain. This is because he has found 3 things wrong and highly incorrect about the theory. 1. Shrinking of Arctic Sea ice doesn't account for the gaining of the Antarctic ice. 2. Earth's temperature today is the same as it was 30 years ago. 3. The sea levels rose at the same height and rate in the 20th century. (8) Here is another correlation that must happen. If the Ice Caps are completely melted as Pro claims then the sea level would have risen completely drowning tons of land.  The graph above is raw satellite image data of the sea level rise over an 8 year period showing that there is little to no change in the Sea Levels rising (9). The sea level rises, on average, about 3 inches per century and it has been found to not even been rising at all.  This graph is the sea levels off the cost of French Guyana which is one of the areas which is predicted to be flooded due to Global Warming, but as you can see by the graph (which goes to 2008) the sea level is currently on a downward trend. Contention 3 - The Benefits of a Warm Climate A moderately warm period is better than a cold period. If the temperature is not too warm, a warm climate can have positive effects on both the Earth as a whole and on everyone. A. Health Effects In moderation, warm temperatures are better for the body than cold temperatures. People cannot get enough heat, infections are rampant, and hospital admissions will rise in the cold. From 1979 to 1997, extreme cold killed roughly twice as many Americans as heat waves [coincidentally when the Earth was heating up]. In Germany, heat waves were found to reduce overall mortality rates slightly, while cold spells led to a significant increase in deaths. In addition, warmer weather decreases incidences of strokes, respiratory diseases, and the flu.[1] In general, life expectancies are higher in warmer climates, and there are fewer incidences of disease and other health problems. A warm period would be beneficial to human health. B. Economic Benefits Some of the major industrial sectors, particularly agriculture, tend to work better in a warmer environment than they do in a cooler environment. 'The book [The Impact of Climate Change] finds that a moderate warming will have a positive economic impact on the agriculture and forestry sectors. Since carbon dioxide is used by plants to capture and store energy, there may be a fertilizing effect as levels of the gas rise. This, combined with longer growing seasons, fewer frosts and more precipitation, among other factors, could benefit some economic sectors.'[2] CO2 increases, a byproduct of temperature increases ([1]), naturally help to stimulate plant growth as well, further helping agriculture. 'For a 300 ppm increase in the atmosphere's CO2 concentration above the planet's current base level of slightly less than 400 ppm, for example, the productivity of earth's herbaceous plants rises by something on the order of 30%, while the productivity of its woody plants rises by something on the order of 50%.'[3][4] This further helps humans by increasing food yields, lowering rates of starvation and hunger. 1) Singer, S. Fred, and Dennis T. Avery: 'Unstoppable Global Warming: Every 1,500 Years.' 2) Contention 3 - The Effects of CO2 Even if Pro were to establish that Global Warming is a threat, he must establish that humans cause a substantial deal of Global Warming before they can establish that Man-made Global Warming is a threat. The main case that Global Warming activists have to prove Man-Made Global Warming is a large part of the picture is the CO2 argument. it doesn’t, however, stand to fact. Carbon Dioxide is, in fact, very weak. Having only a Global Warming Potential of 1. Carbon Dioxide makes up a grand total of 3.618% of the total Gas House Effect, with water vapor making up 95% (1). Carbon Dioxide's number increased from 295 ppm to 400 ppm, an increase of 105 ppm, equal to 49.29 gigatons (1 Gigaton of CO2 is worth 2.13 ppm (2)). Since 1 gigaton of CO2 is worth 0.004% of total Greenhouse Effect, 49.29 gigatons is worth an additional 0.21% (2). We can see the weakness of CO2 in the chart below. If human's did raise CO2 levels by 105 ppm, the effect on the climate would be pathetic. People gravely exaggerate the effect of CO2 on the climate. The chart of Global Warming gases is as follows: GAS -- GREENHOUSE EFFECT -- HUMAN EFFECT Water Vapor ------ 95.000% -- 0.001% Carbon Dioxide -- 3.618% ---- 0.117% Methane ------------ 0.360 ------ 0.066% Nitrous oxide ----- 0.950% ---- 0.047% Misc ------------------- 0.072% ---- 0.047% Total ------------------ 100% ------- 0.278% Following the graph, we can assume correctly that human’s CO2 emissions add very little, if almost anything at all, to Global Warming. If the man-made portion of Global Warming (0.21% of the total) was a threat, than we’d been dead from the natural Global Warming (99.79% of total) long ago. At 0.21%, the rise in temperature from our contribution would be so small that the difference in temperature from Spring to Summer would be greater.</t>

    <t>== Framework ==  For something to be a threat, there only needs to be a reasonable probability that it can cause harm in the future. In contrast, to show that a threat to the environment does not exist, our opponent’s must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there is no possibility that human-caused climate change can cause harm in the future. Our opponent’s burden comes, in part, from the precautionary principle, which holds that we should not take any actions that fundamentally alter our ecosystem (such as emitting large amounts of CO2) unless we are absolutely certain that there will not be problematic consequences to doing so in the long-term. The justification for the precautionary principle is that environmental harm is irreversible and the long-term effects are hard to predict, so we should be extremely certain that our actions will not cause harm before fundamentally altering our ecosystem.  == Case ==  Contention 1: Human-caused global warming exists  The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is an international group of some of the world’s most respected scientists. The IPCC has published five different reports on climate change. With each subsequent generation of report, the reports get more accurate because more datasets become available.  First, warming is happening now. According to the IPCC’s fifth report on climate change: 'Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and oceans have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen, and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased.' 'It is virtually certain that globally the troposphere has warmed since the mid-20th century.' [IPCC 5] The IPCC defines 'virtually certain' as having a 99-100% confidence level. [IPCC 5] The IPCC also says it is virtually certain that we will have more hots days and fewer cold days over major land areas in the future. [IPCC 5] The IPCC says that it is virtually certain that increased cyclone activity is caused by global warming. [IPCC 5] 'It is virtually certain that the upper ocean (0-700 m) warmed from 1971 to 2010.' [IPCC 5] The IPCC says that it is virtually certain that permafrost levels will continue to decline due to global warming. [IPCC 5] 'It is virtually certain that global mean sea level rise will continue beyond 2100' due to global warming. [IPCC 5] The IPCC report also contains numerous findings that are 'very likely' (90-100% confidence level), but for the sake of saving space, we won't excerpt them here.  Second, recent warming is caused by human activity. 'The evidence for human influence has grown since [the previous IPCC report]. It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.' [IPCC 5] 'Extremely likely' is a 95-100% confidence interval. [IPCC 5] Today’s atmospheric CO2 levels are 40 percent higher than the highest natural level of CO2 that has ever existed in the last 800,000 years. We know that most of the increase in CO2 levels is due to burning coal and gasoline because the composition of the CO2 has a unique fingerprint that allows scientists to determine its source. [EDF] Another human activity that has increased CO2 levels is the massive clear cutting of the rainforests, which formerly acted as a huge carbon sink, absorbing large amounts of CO2. [EDF] Deforestation adds 1,500,000,000,000,000 grams of carbon to the atmosphere each year. Thus, humans contribute greatly to global warming.  The data proving that human-caused global warming exists has become so overwhelming that it has converted former climate skeptics, such as University of California, Berkeley, professor Richard Muller. Muller writes: “'Call me a converted skeptic. Three years ago I identified problems in previous climate studies that, in my mind, threw doubt on the very existence of global warming. Last year, following an intensive research effort involving a dozen scientists, I concluded that global warming was real and that the prior estimates of the rate of warming were correct. I’m now going a step further: Humans are almost entirely the cause. [New data from UC Berkeley] show[s] that the average temperature of the earth’s land has risen by two and a half degrees Fahrenheit over the past 250 years, including an increase of one and a half degrees over the most recent 50 years. Moreover, it appears likely that essentially all of this increase results from the human emission of greenhouse gases. [The UC Berkeley data set is] stronger than those of [previous IPCC reports].' Third, there is significant evidence in the paleoclimatic record that greenhouse gasses have a significant effect on the global temperature. Over the Cenozoic Era, which began about 66 million years ago, we can see a clear greenhouse induced warming effect within the various warming and cooling cycles. It remains very clear that CO2 remains the main driver of climate in this period. The large climate changes over the period cannot result from shifts in the climate system, but depend on both energy coming into the planet (e.g. solar rays) and changes in the atmosphere (greenhouse gasses). The sun, however, cannot be considered the dominant force of climate change in this time period because the luminosity increased by about 0.4% over this period. That alone cannot explain the warming during the Cenozoic because the Cenozoic has also seen a period of decreasing temperatures, which could only be explained by fluctuating CO2 levels (from 1000 ppm at the beginning of the Cenozoic to a low of 170 ppm). If the sun was responsible for the warming during this period, we’d see only a constant increase in temperatures. Continental movement also is unlikely as an explanation for the observed climate change during this period due to the fact that “most continents were near their present latitudes at the beginning of the Cenozoic.” Studies have concluded that “CO2 was the dominant climate forcing in the Cenozoic”. Contention 2: Future harm from global warming  By 2100, global warming is estimated to cause $1.9 trillion per year in economic damages to the United States. The damage includes $360 billion from destroyed real estate due to rising sea levels, $141 billion in higher energy costs due to higher demand for air conditioning, $950 billion due to the cost of providing water to places where it dries up, and $422 billion in damages from the increase in tropical storms due to global warming. [NRDC]  Future sea level rise, even by conservative estimates, are significant and would threaten “some coastal cities and low-lying island nations.” The low estimates--assuming less than 2 degrees celsius warming and a decreased temperature trend after 1950--find that there will be about half a meter sea level rise by the year 2100. Food production, important to the well being of society, also represents a large industry: about $200 billion a year to the US economy. Agriculture is dependent upon certain climatic conditions and altering these could prove to be catastrophic. While an initial increase in temperature may help some crops, once temperatures pass the crop’s optimal levels for growth and reproduction, increased warming becomes counterproductive. Some crops, like grains, grow faster when the climate is warmer, but because these crops grow faster, they have less time to fully mature, so they produce fewer edible byproducts. [EPA] Further, weeds thrive in warmer climates with more CO2 enrichments. Farmers already spend $11 billion a year combating weeds. Future temperature increases would add another burden to the industry [EPA]. Lastly, climate change dries out and acidifies soil, further impacting food production. Many theoretical models exist claiming that certain diseases would become more common as the climate changes. For example, increased temperatures will allow the virus that causes dengue fever to survive in more places. In 1990, 30% of the world’s population lived in regions where the estimated risk of dengue fever transmission was 50%. By 2085, 5-6 billion people (about half of the future estimated population) would live in areas where they were at risk of dengue transmission. If climate changes do not occur, only 35% of the population would be at risk. Conclusion As you can see from our prior contentions, man made global warming is in fact a threat and can cause a great deal of harm. Even if Con casts some doubt on the harm caused by global warming, as long as we win that some harm is probable, we win this debate. Almost any amount of harm is enough for you as the judge to affirm the resolution that global warming is a threat. For the Con team to win this debate they must negate all of our contentions and statistics along with building a case of their own showing that there is in fact no threat from global warming. We can clearly see from the prior contentions that there is indeed a threat and it can and will cause harm.</t>

    <t>I apologize to all - Lannan wrote the first two contentions in the last argument, but he can’t present refutations this round due to time conflictions. I (Subutai) will do my best to address Mikal’s concerns, but I will take liberties in presenting arguments that will deviate from what Lannan wrote. I also only have about an hour left, so I also apologize if anything looks sloppy. Contention 1 - Anthropogenic Global Warming There seems to be some disagreement between the different people writing the different arguments. I am simply going to show three reasons why an anthropogenic cause is unlikely. First, according to the greenhouse effect, global warming should be starting from the lower atmosphere and moved to the surface (because the CO2 collects in the upper troposphere first). However, this is not happening. '...satellite and high-altitude balloon data confirm that the lower atmosphere is not trapping lots of additional heat due to higher CO2 concentrations. It is hard to know how fast the Earth's highly variable surface is warming, but it is warming faster than the lower atmosphere where the CO2 is accumulating. This is strong evidence that CO2 is not the primary climate factor.'[1] Here is a graph showing how the surface has warmed more than the troposphere:   Second, current levels of CO2 have very little effect on temperature. The greenhouse effect certainly exists, but it doesn't become linearly stronger with increasing amounts of CO2. CO2's effect on temperature is logarithmic, meaning that each additional increase has a smaller effect on the climate than the last. 'The carbon that is already up in the atmosphere absorbs most of the light it can. CO2 only soaks up its favorite wavelengths of light and it's close to its saturation point. It manages to grab a bit more light from wavelengths that are close to its favorite bands but it can't do much more, because there are not many left-over photons at the right wavelengths.'[2][3] This chart shows approximately the effect that each additional increment of CO2 increase has on temperature:   Note how the pre-industrial to modern level increase has had less than a 0.2 C increase in temperature. Third and most importantly, the predicted 'hot-spot' 10 miles above the tropics that would be a signature of CO2-induced global warming is absent. 'The computer models show that greenhouse warming will cause a hot-spot at an altitude between 8 and 12 km over the tropics between 30 N and 30 S. The temperature at this hot-spot is projected to increase at a rate of two to three times faster than at the surface. However, the Hadley Centre's real-world plot of radiosonde temperature observations shown below does not show the projected CO2 induced global warming hot-spot at all. The predicted hot-spot is entirely absent from the observational record. This shows that atmosphere warming theory programmed into climate models are wrong.'[2] Here is the plot of predicted temperature changes due to CO2:  However, here is the actual observed temperature changes:    The hot spot is completely missing, which is pretty much a knockout blow to the anthropogenic global warming theory. And to be fair to Easterbrook, the IPCC isn’t very good at predicting the climate either: The climate seems to have a mind of its own that we haven’t deciphered yet. However, it looks very unlikely that anthropogenic causes are behind the recent global warming. [1]: Singer, S. Fred, and Dennis T. Avery: Unstoppable Global Warming: Every 1,500 Years. Contention 2 - Sea Level Rise Even though some groups like to show scenes of global apocalypse with this, the truth is that the sea level hasn’t risen that much. However, both past and predicted rise have been greatly exaggerated. The linear trend shows a sea level rise of only 1.31 +/- 0.30 mm/year. 'The Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory estimates the rate of sea level rise at 1.42 plus or minus 0.14 mm/year for the period 1954 to 2003. This is less than the estimate of 1.91 plus or minus 0.14 mm/year for the period 1902 to 1953, indicating a slowing of the rate.' That’s an increase of around 2.8 inches in the last 50 years – not that much of an apocalyptic scenario.[1][2]  Future sea level predictions are even better. As of currently, global ocean heat content has not changed in recent years. Sea level itself has actually been declining for the last decade.    “The ‘INQUA Commission on Sea-Level Change and Coastal Evolution’ led by Dr. Morner, prepared as estimate that the global sea level will rise 10 cm plus or minus 10 cm in the next 100 years. Dr. Morner has since revised his estimate to 5 cm per 100 years after considering data of the Sun activity suggesting that the warming trend may have ended and the Earth may be headed into a cooling trend.” That’s around 2.5 inches in the next 100 years. That’s really not too bad.[2][3] As for Tuvalu, sea level has actually dropped four inches in the last 20 years and there is no evidence based on the observations that sea level rise there is accelerating.[4] In general, there is no cause for concern here. Contention 3 - Benefits of Global Warming If we take the rest of our argument (take, for example, global warming), we see that the potential threats of global warming are only exaggerated, if not unimportant. This contention is built upon the previous arguments.  A - Health Benefits If the flu is correlated to heat, then why is the flu worse during the winter months? In fact, the virus dies quicker in warmer weather than colder weather. The Plague of Justinian was partially caused by a colder climate.[1] As for deaths from heat and cold, 'The only global study suggests that this is true internationally: by 2050, there will be almost 400,000 more heat-related deaths a year, and almost 1.8 million fewer cold-related deaths. Warmer temperatures will save 1.4 million lives each year. The number of saved lives will outweigh the increase in heat-related deaths until at least 2200.'[2] Yes, while it is easier to make fire than an air conditioner, heat is, overall, better for the body than cold (to a point). People in the Middle East are healthier (when controlled, that is) than people in, say, Siberia. What my opponent cites is not an increase in deaths from warming per se, but in temperature variability: 'The claim that warming increases morbidity rates is a myth. This isn't the case, according to Dr. Robert Mendelsohn, an environmental economist from Yale University. Mendelsohn argues that heat-stress deaths are caused by temperature variability and not warming. Those deaths grow in number not as climates warm but as the variability in climate increases.'[3]  B - Economic Benefits There’s no reason, beyond the most apocalyptic of models that the warming would be so bad that plants would be severely affected beyond what they can handle. Plus, you never responded to my claim that CO2 helps crops. [1]. Contention IV: The Effects of CO2. Pro is playing with words here. The idea of a threat isn’t that it’s kinda not okay, but that it is in fact an issue. A paper cut isn’t a threat, but a knife cut to the artery is. Pro must establish that Man-Made Global Warming is an actual issue that could harm0 us, not that it’s just not good. As for the term Man-Made Global Warming, it refers to the topic as it is or is likely to become. Not what it would be in an unlikely scenario. If human’s contribution to Global Warming, as it is or might be, isn’t large enough to justify being called a threat, than Pro has not affirmed the Resolution. Regarding CO2 causing temperatures to rise enough to cause enough evaporation… This is an extreme case of slippery slope. It gravely assumes CO2 will cause that kind of increase in Water Vapor. Water Vapor is very weak. The increase in tempature needed to give Water Vapor the quantity to affirm the resolution is nearly unreachable.I’ve already established how weak CO2 is. It would take unimaginable amounts of it to cause such an increase in Global Warming. Pro’s argument is so often quoted, but it’s simply improbable. Unless Pro can establish that Man-Made CO2 has enough of an effect to start that cycle, he can’t prove such a slippery slope. Another flaw in Pro’s argument is that it’s ignorant of historic records. Let’s look at history... CO2 ppm is at 400 right now, but in the Mesozoic period and Cambrian Perios, it reached 2000-4000 and 7000 ppm.(5) At 7000 ppm, the temperatures were only 10ºc higher than today. Proportionately, temperatures should have been 54.23ºc higher than now. This empathizes how little of an impact CO2 has on the global temperature.  With how weak CO2 is, it would take insane quantities to accomplish what Pro claims it will. But even at 7000 ppm, it was unable to increase the temperature enough to support Pro’s case, especially if water evaporation was enough to escalate it. More evidence of the weakness of CO2 can be found in the current Global Warming Cycle. Pro shows a CO2 chart of the past 10,000 years... Here is a chart of the CO2 levels and Global Warming level from the past 400,000 years.  As we can see, despite the abnormal CO2 presence, temperatures today are actually the lowest in the past 400k years of Global Warming cycles, which are common and completely natural. Despite Pro’s claim, CO2 simply does not have the necessary effects. It may follow warmer temperatures, but warming temperatures do not follow it. When temperatures rise, CO2 rises, but when we see CO2 rise, temperatures don’t rise with it. Historically, and even now, CO2 does not bring forth the effects needed to prove it has a substantial effect on warming. Or that it’s effect is large enough to cause temperatures to rise enough to increase Water Vapor.</t>

  <pair id="465" entailment="ENTAILMENT" task="IE">
    <t>R1) Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) ExistsRight from the start we can see a lot of errors from Con’s opening arguments and graphs. The first thing we want to note is that Con’s first graph about atmospheric CO2 levels is extremely misleading. Although Con doesn’t source it, Con’s graph comes from a study by Robert Berner. There are HUGE uncertainties in Berner’s guesses as to what CO2 levels were hundreds of millions of years ago. You can see in the chart below that the range of error is huge. Also Berner himself said that the “exact values of CO2 [in his report] should not be taken literally.” Berner’s guess-work therefore cannot be cited as the actual values for CO2 levels in the past.  Second, the sun was so much dimmer hundreds of millions of years ago that higher CO2 levels were needed just to prevent the Earth from freezing over. (During this period, the sun “would have been several percent dimmer according to established nuclear models of main sequence stars . . .  with a dimmer sun, high CO2 is necessary to stop the Earth freezing over.”) [SkS1] Berner even said, compensating for all the factors that were different in the past, “over the long term there is indeed a correlation between CO2 and paleotemperature”. Third, you can see that over the past 10,000 years, CO2 levels today are at an all time high. CO2 has risen exponentially since the start of the industrial revolution. Unlike over a time scale of millions of years, the luminosity of the sun has been relatively constant over the last 10,000 years, so the only factor that has changed has been CO2 levels. Therefore, the only factor that can explain the temperature increase over the last 10,000 years is CO2. Fourth, Con is blatantly wrong. The greenhouse effect is obviously a real effect that is acknowledged by every scientist in the world. When you walk into a hot car or an actual greenhouse, it has heated up so quickly because of the CO2 in the car or greenhouse. It is impossible to assert that CO2 levels have *no* effect on temperature. The following chart shows the correlation between CO2 and temperature over the last 500 million years. The dotted line is CO2 and temperature is the solid line. The study also concludes that if you look at the luminosity of the sun alone, without accounting for CO2 levels, luminosity alone *fails* to explain temperature fluctuations. Our opponents next cite Don Easterbrook, who predicts a cooling in the near future. However, his predictions have been outrageously incorrect for the first 10 years of its data. The following graph depicts Easterbrook’s failed predictions:[SkS3]   You can see from the graph that temperatures have actually increased, not declined as Eastberbook predicted.  Further, although Easterbrook portrays the IPCC’s prediction of the temperatures since 2000 as incorrect, the IPCC actually got the story much closer to reality than Easterbrook. When confronted as to where Easterbrook obtained the IPCC data, he claimed he got it from the website, but that they had deleted it. The data he portrays shows future temperature predictions based on greenhouse gasses alone, which is not the actual IPCC data from the IPCC reports (which included natural factors as well). In other words, Easterbrook’s model has failed to predict what has occurred and his refutations of IPCC findings refutes a dataset that the IPCC never even used in their report because it is not a complete picture of the causes of warming. R2) Sea levels and ice levels  Con says that Al Gore said all the ice would be gone by now. We never cited Al Gore and there are a lot of unscientific things said in his documentary. Who cares what he said, Al Gore is not a scientist nor a viable source.  Con drops the IPCC study that says ice levels will continue to decline in the future.  Con also says that some Coast Guard boat is also seeing ice up north. We have never said there is zero ice anymore. Con is just straw-manning.  Third, Con cites some sketchy tabloid-esque picture of the northern ice sheet. Taking 2 photos a year apart does not prove anything. You need to look at averages. If you take a photo on a bad day in 2012 and a really good day for the ice sheet in 2013, it might look like the ice sheet is increasing, but you have to look at annual average size, not the size on a particular date. It’s the same problem with saying “it’s cold outside today, so there’s no global warming.” If you measure global temperature on one day in 2012 and on one day in 2013 and say, “see the temperature has gone down,” that’s not proof that global temperatures are falling. Again, we need to look at yearly averages, not snapshots of a single day.  Here is the *average* amount of ice in the ice sheet over time; it’s declining (because it’s melting). Next, Con cites Dr. Koonin, who didn’t say global warming doesn’t exist, but merely that climate models are uncertain. Something can still be a threat, even if the models are not accurate to 100% certainty.  Con also notes that temperatures have not risen dramatically over the last 30 years. This is due to a series of El Nino events that have pushed some hot water from the surface into the deep ocean. This effect will not continue forever; we just got lucky that ocean circulation shifts managed to shift some heat into the deep oceans. IPCC climate models that predict an increase in temperature of 2 degrees in the future account for these El Nino events.  Con also says that sea levels have not been rising any faster than in the past. However, sea levels have been rising *twice* as fast over the last 20 years than they did in the preceding 80 years. Con looks at an 8 year period and says the rate isn’t increasing, but the only reason that would be relevant is if the rate of CO2 emissions was a lot higher at the end of the 8 year period than at the beginning. If the amount of CO2 emitted by humans per year stayed relatively constant over this period, you wouldn’t expect sea levels to start rising any faster. Also, Con is merely cherry picking an 8 year period that looks favorable to them. If you look at trends over a broader time scale (100 years), the rate of increase has gone up.  Con then merely straw mans our argument and says that if polar ice caps had *completely* melted already (something we never claimed), then French Guyana would be underwater. We never made this claim. We only said that some island nations, like Kiribati, have thus far been swallowed by the sea. R3) Global warming is, on balance, good  First, Con can’t outweigh a threat. Nukes are a threat. On balance, mutually assured destruction may be beneficial to global peace, but nukes are still a “threat” to the United States. Even if something has some good effects, it can still be a threat.  Second, Con’s points don’t outweigh the harms of global warming.  (A) Health Effects  Con claims that overall health would be positively impacted by higher temperatures. However, they don’t link their source (they cite a book, but don’t provide a link or a page number). There’s no scientific explanation for why strokes or respiratory disease would decline with warmer temperatures. Research has also shown that the severity of the flu virus would *increase* (not decrease) as temperatures warmed. Warmer winters lead to more severe flu outbreaks--which, by definition, means a warming climate would make flu epidemics more widespread and harmful.  Con also claims that “extreme cold” has killed more people than heat waves. However, “extreme cold” refers to people who have died in blizzards or while backpacking. If you don’t prepare for the cold when you go outside, you’re going to die. In contrast, people don’t die in their houses because it’s too cold; they can always throw on more blankets. People without air conditioning, however, do die from heat waves. A 2003 heatwave in Europe killed 35,000 people. On balance, “increases in heat-related deaths due to climate change would outweigh decreases in deaths from cold-snaps.” (B) Economic Effects Con never proves that the benefits to crop outweighs the $1.9 trillion per year the US will lose due to global warming. Also, we already refuted these arguments last round. Con says that a “moderate” increase in temperatures benefits crops, but there’s no proof the increase will stay moderate and once it becomes too severe, crops are severely harmed. In addition, while crops grow faster in warmer climates, they grow too fast, leaving less time to mature, so they produce fewer edible byproducts.   R4) Effects of CO2First, Con says we have prove that human-caused warming is a “substantial” part of warming, but we don’t have to prove it’s a substantial threat, just a threat, so this is *not* something we have to prove. The degree of danger from the threat can make it *more* of a threat, but a threat is still a threat. Second, CO2 has a cascade effect. When CO2 causes temperature to increase a little bit, that causes more evaporation from the oceans which leads to more water vapor in the atmosphere. So even if water vapor has the largest effect on global warming, CO2 emissions cause more water vapor to be released into the air, which is called a positive feedback loop. (“The amplifying effect of water vapor has been observed in empirical studies such as Soden 2001”). Third, Con is conceding the greenhouse effect exists in this contention, which destroys their first contention, where they are trying to deny that the greenhouse effect is even a real phenomenon.</t>

    <t>We are not going to make new arguments, and keep it to a summary.  We've proven that global warming will cause massive amounts of economic harms, and a large increase in the death toll. The magnitude of the impacts are so large, even if we only prove a small probability of human-caused warming, we win that it is a 'threat.' The same is true of nuclear war: it is a threat because the magnitude of its impacts is so large, even if the probability of it happening is small. C1Our opponents argue that tropospheric warming is minimal and that no hotspot exists. This is incorrect. Our opponent’s first graph shows no error bars. With no source along with the graph, it is impossible to properly fact check it--we don’t know if the author of the graph is legitimate--however, we provide references with all the graphics we use, most of which coming from peer-reviewed articles. The study which proposes a lot of the anti-tropospheric warming argumentation (Douglass et al) has multiple problems with it. When errors are corrected and error bars added, models correctly replicate tropospheric warming. Further, research by climate skeptic John Christy eviscerates the supposed discrepancy between surface temperatures and tropospheric temperatures which the CON team brings up. When measurement error in radiosonde and satellite data are corrected, the discrepancy is erased. Only small discrepancies exist near the tropics in radiosonde data, however most researchers think the difference is due to still unknown “instrument errors”. Two hotspot graphs used by CON are based upon radiosonde data. These graphs attempt to show the tropospheric hot spot does not exist. However there is no discrepancy between predictions and observable measurements except in the tropics--these graphs use these locations. However, the stations in the tropics are spread out and too few in number to provide a realistic picture as to what is going on with the climate. Overall, these results should be taken with a grain of salt. When these issues are accounted for, tropospheric hotspots are found to exist.  [RC]  As can be seen, there are very few radiosonde positions in the tropics.   Our opponents claim CO2 is logarithmic to temperature. We agree with this and are well versed with this piece of information. Our opponent’s graph demonstrates the effect of CO2 (with no feedbacks) is about 1 degree C of warming per doubling of CO2 (from pre industrial levels). This is accepted by both sides of the aisle. If feedbacks are included, the effect of CO2 doubling is likely 3 degrees C. The logarithmic effect also means that every doubling of CO2 will have about the same forcing (eg, 100 to 200 ppm 3 degrees, 200 to 400 another 3, etc). Again, the logarithmic effect is accepted by everyone in the field of science--the question is again, the effect of feedbacks, something our opponents have not mentioned.  CON also argues the IPCC has failed to predict temperatures. However, this is incorrect. Using an average of GISS, NASA, NOAA, NCDC, and the HADCRUT4 surface temperatures, the IPCC has accurately predicted temperatures over the period of 1990 - 2012. The IPCC predicted 0.2 degrees C warming per decade, which is well within the margin of error for actual temperatures (0.15 degrees C per decade, +/- 0.08).   [SkS]  C2   Our opponents paint a very optimistic picture in relation to sea level rise. An extensive study in 2008, using measurements from satellites, has found that the rate of sea level rise has actually  increased from 1870 - 2006. The reason for a small reduction in sea levels--which our opponents cite--are likely from the volcanic eruptions from the 1960s - 90s, which caused cooling. However, when these eruptions ceased, sea levels again rose. In fact, “the rate of rise over the five most recent 20-year periods is 25% greater than the next largest set of values during the 1940s” .    Our opponent’s study used more regionalized stations to measure sea level. The graph claiming no increase in heat content is based on the NODC study Levitus et al. HOWEVER, our opponents graph ONLY resembles the graph using depths of up to 700 meters. And even then, there is a significant increase in heat content increase not reported in CON’s graph. Using global ocean heat content, the rate continues to increase and does not “flatten”. Our opponents source (likely from the skeptic blogosphere) misrepresents the actual findings of the study.   Tuvalu is regional, not global, and therefore is not relevant to this debate. Simply because sea level is falling in one area does not mean the global average will display the same characteristics.    C3 (a)Health Benefits  Our opponent cites our source but misrepresents its content. The flu worsens with warming temperatures because the warmer it is, the less flu there is on a certain season. However, the following season sees a dramatic outbreak of the flu significantly worse than in previous years due to the fact that 1) fewer people catch the disease and 2) threat perception decreases. And with a perception of threat low, fewer vaccinate, and therefore there is more disease in the long term.   To argue deaths from cold snaps override deaths from heatwaves is untrue. The EPA, as previously cited, was using data from a large review of the literature published by cambridge. To counter… you cite an op-ed. Now, that does not mean you are inherently incorrect, but the literature has already refuted that hypothesis. A recent publication has found that “[w]hile global tem­per­a­ture is indeed increasing, so too is the vari­ability in tem­per­a­ture extremes”. They also found, “this means that even as overall tem­per­a­tures rise, we may still con­tinue to expe­ri­ence extreme cold snaps”. In other words, not only will people die from heat waves, but cold snaps will still exist and will still cause substantial harm, negating the premise of Lomborg’s op-ed. The World Health Organization also disagrees, arguing the effect to human health will be catastrophic. In one large heat wave in Europe, “more than 70,000 excess deaths were recorded” .   Our opponents have also ignored our argument on Dengue fever and other tropical illnesses. The dengue fever used to be only a tropical disease, but climate change has caused it to be much more widespread. Further, malaria and other infectious diseases are destined to kill more people as the climate warms.(b) Economic effects  Our opponents claim we never responded to their position on crops. This is incorrect. We did in all of our rounds. We demonstrated a harm to the farming economy, and the fact that more CO2 = faster maturing plants, which = fewer plant yields. The NRC has looked at the literature, and finds that if the world warms 3 degrees C, crop yields will fall dramatically. If it increases, 2 degrees, there will still be a decrease. And if it increases 1 degree (this is with no feedbacks), there will be a decrease in yields except in mid latitude areas. Overall, the effect will be negative. To claim that water vapor is weak is contradictory to previous claims you have made, which argue water vapor is the primary greenhouse gas. Without feedbacks, the doubling of CO2 will increase temperatures by 1 degree celsius. This is not “insignificant”, and is enough to begin the positive feedback loop. Empiricals studies have demonstrated this effect, and climate sensitivity is generally considered about 3 degrees C per doubling of CO2.  Further, our opponent’s math is incorrect. It takes about 5 co2 doublings from the pre-industrial period to reach 7000 ppm. This, with sensitivity and the logarithmic effect accounted for, would lead to 15 degrees C of warming, not 54 degrees. This is within the margin of error, meaning the examples presented do not disprove the relationship between CO2 and temperature. Further, the temperature was closer to +15 degrees, not +10 like CON argues. In the Cambrian, there is no real accurate picture of what temperatures were like, due to the fact it was so long ago. Further, these calculations fail to account for the position of the continents or the sun, which also affect climate. Where the landmass was in the cretaceous is “may have had a radiative effect equivalent to +1 CO2 doubling” [Royer, personal correspondence]. This means that to get an accurate picture of the climate, we have to account for other factors. In fact, recent research has demonstrated this, and finds that the climate sensitivity to CO2 is at least 3 degrees C. The fact is, a look into history supports AGW theory, it does not weaken it.   Again, a graph which does not show much at all. It does not account for other factors which may be stunting warming (e.g. aerosols). The IPCC has looked into the evidence within this time frame, and finds that “it is very likely that glacial-interglacial CO2 variations have strongly amplifed climate variations”.</t>

<h>Contention 1: No Major/any CO2 Increase.      Many Global Warming advocates state that CO2 levels are skyrocketing, but that is incorrect. I give you the above graph measuring the past 600 million years of CO2 levels are we are actually at an all time low. Now the website I got this from no longer has this page up so I appologize. We can see from observance of this graph that we being at all time CO2 low levles that we are nowhere close to meeting the impact that my opponent brings up. We have been over 5,000 ppm of CO2 in our atmosphere and are now currently around apprx. 350 ppm CO2 levels.  The above graph shows that comparisions of C13 (Carbon isotope) and this shows that there is little to no trend pertrade in many of these as the average is zero while the trend for all of these are zero. (http://www.drroyspencer.com...) This is important as the Carbon isotope is important in measuring this so called 'Global Warming.'  This chart above shows the CO2 and Earth's temperatures for the past 600 million years. My opponent's claims are incorect as we have had aburd levels of CO2 and temperature on Earth and may I ask how did we survive that? (http://www.sustainableoregon.com...)  Now I will move on to how Earth is actually cooling and how it's temperature is cooler than it has been. Contention 2: Earth is cooling.  If we observe the above graph we can see that Earth has been a whole lot hotter than where we currently are to the point where the Earth's average temperature has been 7.5 degrees Celcuis hotter than it currently it is. You can also see that in the span of the past 10,000 years the temperature has leveld off, but you may ask yourself where does that place us in the lights of modern day?  I am going to site Dr. Done Easterbrook, who is a climate scientist. Back in 2000 he predicted that Earth was entering a cooling phase. He predicts that for the next 20 years Earth will cool by 3/10 degree each year and that we are going to enter another little Ice Age like we did from 1650 and 1790. (http://www.cnsnews.com...)  The funny thing is that many of my opponent's charts are actually from the incorrect IPPC. How about the 'Hockey Stick' graph that many Global Warming supporters , including my opponent, argue about? Well if we observe the fallowing chart taken from Northern Scandenavia we can see that the Global trend over the past 1,000 years that the Global Cooling trend slope is that of -0.31 Degrees Celcuis, give or take 0.03 degrees (for the error room). Professor Dr. Jan Esper has found that the Earth's temperature of Earth actually decreases 0.3 per millenia due to the Earth moving away from the sun. (http://newsbusters.org...)   Here is another graph from 1920 to 2005 and we can see that the graph has a negative temperature slope, thus meaning that the Earth is under a period of cooling. (http://blog.chron.com...)  Contention 3: Artic Ice. First, I would like to state that Pro's claim about the North Pole completely melting is bogus. Al Gore stated that the Artic Ice would be completely melted by 2014, but he is incorrect then and now.  Jan. 6, 2012: The Coast Guard Cutter Healy breaks ice around the Russian-flagged tanker Renda 250 miles south of Nome. The Healy is the Coast Guard’s only currently operating polar icebreaker. The vessels are transiting through ice up to five-feet thick in this area. The 370-foot tanker Renda will have to go through more than 300 miles of sea ice to get to Nome, a city of about 3,500 people on the western Alaska coastline that did not get its last pre-winter fuel delivery because of a massive storm. (http://www.thegatewaypundit.com...)  Let's go back to 2007-2008 and see if his claim was justified in the Artic Ice activity.  Hmmm... It seems that he is incorrect, but let's look further into the near past. How about 2012-2013? (http://ginacobb.typepad.com...)  We all remember the Climate Scientists that got stuck in Arctic Ice Earlier this year correct? Then a Russian Ice Breaker tried to free them, but got stuck. Can you guess what they were studying? They had predicted that all the Arctic Ice had melted due to Global Warming and that Earth would get flooded massively. Boy were they wrong. (http://www.nytimes.com...)   (http://www.americasfreedomfighters.com...)  How about Al Gore. The man who brought Global Warming to our attention? In 2009, the man breaks down in tears stating how it's nothing, but hot air and how he fabricated everything just for the money! He said the arctic sheets are not melting and CO2 is not responsible for depletion of the Ozone. (http://www.thomaspeep.com...) Dr. Koonin, former head of the Department of Energy under President Obama, has stated that the Global Warming scare is not suttle. This is because that he has found 3 things wrong and highly incorrect about the scare. 1. Shrinking of Artic Sea ice doesn't acount for the gaining of the Antartic ice. 2. The warming of Earth's temps today is the same as it was 30 years ago. 3. The sea levels rose at the same height and rate in the 20th cenury. (http://www.newsmax.com...)  Contention 4: Sea Levels  Here is another corralation that must happen. If the Ice Caps are completely melted as Pro claims then the sea level would have risen completely drowning tons of land.  The graph above is raw satellite image data of the sea level rise over an 8 year period showing that there is little to no change in the Sea Levels rising. (http://joannenova.com.au...) The sea level rises, on average, about 3 inches per century and it has been found to not even been rising at all.  This graph is the sea levels off the cost of French Guyana which is one of the areas which is predicted to be flooded due to Global Warming, but as you can see by the graph (which goes to 2008) the sea level is currently on a downward trend.(http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org...) The source is the PDF within the link.Contention 5: The Weather My opponent is claiming that Hurricanes are increasing due to Global Warming, but this claim is indeed false! The hurricanes since the year 1900 to 2008 have actually been decreasing. The slope of this downward slope is .0016. Though it is small the hurricanes are still in a downward trend.As a matter of fact not only are Hurricanes on a downward trend, but they are at an all time low as in the year 2010, there was only 68 Hurricanes Globally, which is an all time low in the past 40 years. (http://wattsupwiththat.com......) How about Tornados you may ask? In the graph above you can see that tornados are at an all time low in the past 60 years! (http://wattsupwiththat.com...)  But what about Hurricanes?Here is a graph showing the number of days between hurricanes and this shows that the number of days between hurricanes is greatest at 76 days between hurricanes.The slope of this line is zero showing no trend of a massive storm increase.Now I must end my argument here before I run out of my characters.

  </pair>
  <pair id="471" entailment="ENTAILMENT" task="IE">
    <t>First of all I want to touch on your rebuttal that carbon levels have not increased drastically over the course of earths existence. Although it is true that earth had much more carbon dioxide several million years ago this was counteracted by massive amounts of plant life that photosynthesized to create the air you breath today and the oil you put in your car. thus the massive amount of Co2 drops that range from super volcano explosions from Yosemite national park or other cataclysmic events that caused the death of millions of plants and thus a spike in Co2 levels. It would be nice to imagine that this is natural but it is not. For as you see in his very first graph Co2 levels are going up at a faster rate than any other time period besides the late Cambrian period. Yet this increase is not due to any natural cataclysmic but instead a self made increase in Co2 which has increased by a factor of five in a mere 200 years. This time zone is a speck in your million year graph but is increasing at a exponential rate and has yet to slow. I would also like to answer your rhetorical question that you posed on how we survived such'absurd levels of Co2 and temperature on Earth' and the fact is we didn't have to because the Co2 fluctuation that you are describing happened hundreds of millions of years in the past were the earth would have not been able to support human life as we know it. In your third graph you once again use data from hundreds of millions of years ago to set a standard for earths temperature. The two temperature shifts happened for very different reasons one being asteroid induced Apocalypse and the current Co2 increase due to human activity.  In relation to your arguments that global temperature readings are going down NASA would beg to differ as they have recorded a gradual increase in temperature. I am also curious when you are saying my opponents graphs or I disagree with both Al Gore and the IPCC on their global warming estimates but you continue to use a straw man argument and putting words in my mouth that I never said.  I also have problems with your hockey stick graph which does not have its y axis labeled and the line of best fit that was drawn on the graph after that because it is not accurate to NASA climate readings and thus I can only assume are based on land based climate measurement stations that can be quoted by both believers and skeptics of global warming due to their chronic irritability.  You have also miss quoted my statement on arctic ice which i did not say was melting but rather I said that the ozone layer is weakening above it. Although this hole is slowly repairing itself it is still weak to fluctuation and thus we are very lucky that it is repairing itself after decades of damage by CFC's.Scientists also have no clue as to why arctic ice is thickening and do not know how long it will last. Thus I o not believe that the melting of arctic ice will lead to a increase in sea level know due to the still unexplained thickening of arctic ice but if we do not do something this unexplained blessing may revert back to its original melting stage that will cause cities like New York and Boston to be more susceptible to flooding.  In relation to your data on storms I miss wrote my opinion for you are correct that their have currently been less storms than in the past. However, the storms that do get created have been far more devastating and have shown up in places that almost never receive a hurricane the most prominent example being New York and even further back hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. Tornadoes have become less common due to reasons that scientists do not understand because we still do not fully understand how tornado are created.  I also noticed how you left out my argument on droughts due to the definitive proof that the number of droughts have increased around the world from the Midwest to India these drought swill only get worse and slowly rising temperatures will only exasperate the problem  Finally I would ask that you research your graphs a little bit more for the Co2 graphs you found that spanned millions of years had almost nothing to do with global warming as well as not discounting a phenomena just because the scientific community does not fully understand it. Good luck in our counter argument</t>

    <t>Firstly I'd like to point out that Co2 is not CO2, because Co is the element symbol for Cobalt not Carbon Dioxide. Please be careful. My opponent argues stating that the graphs of millions of years ago doesn't matter, but it does, because if the harms of Global Warming that my opponent says are true then we currently wouldn't be here, because as I have showed Earth has had CO2 levels and Global Temperatures way higher then we currently do. This shows that my opponent's case has no impact to it. Then he goes on to say that there's a spike in levels due to oil and such, but if you remember the chart that I have given you in my last round you can see that it has a negative slope with means that Earth is actually cooling. In my 4th Graph you can see that the IPPC is incorrect in there readings of Global Warming and that we are currently cooling and heading into another Little Ice Age.  As for you EPA souce, I have already pre-refuted that in my last round with my hockey stick chart evidence showing that we have a negative slope in terms of the Global Temperature showing that we are cooling and not warming.  My opponent drops my second graph showing that though we have had a major increase in the burning of focil fuels that it has had no effect on the atmosphere. My Hockey stick Chart, if you click on the link that I had provided you, is from the Johannes Guttenburg University where the scienctists there conducted a study and that was their evidence. This study was conducted in the Artic Lattitudes and, you would think that if Global Warming exists that it would have an upward slope, but it has a down ward slope.  Last Decade the US has passed the Kyoto Protocol which banned the Production of CFC's from first world nation's, but will have no real impact due to it excluding countries like China and India. You can see in terms of more Warming in the evidence in which Scientists use Ice Cores Earth has actually been Cooling the past Mellenium.  You can see that in terms of Gasses contribution to the Green House Effect the major contributer is Water Vapor and it's at 95% to CO2's 3.6% and this is the overall contribution including man made and natural. When we look to the chart on the left we can see that Man-Made CO2 does have a higher contribution to the atmosphere than Water Vapor, but that's because we do not create much water vapor as humans. Even with this evidence we can see that CO2 does not have any effect what-so-ever compared to Water Vapor. Where might those CFCs be on this graph you may ask. Why it's under the Misc. gases section. Though the world has been in a drought for hundreds of years the techonology has been picking up with new agricultural techonolgies like GMOs and factory farming.</t>
<h>    Firstly I'd like to point out that Co2 is not CO2, because Co is the element symbol for Cobalt not Carbon Dioxide.</h>

    <t>First of all sorry for the CO2 typo spellchecker loves to hate on me  I am also a bit annoyed that you have misconstrued my point on the first few graphs you used which had a measurement of earths greenhouse gas levels over millions of years. To be clear these CO2 spikes happened due to mass extinctions that left a majority of plant life dead on the earth. Thus unless you are implying that massive amounts of plant life is dying the current spike of CO2 is man made. And in relation to your graphs that earth is heading towards a cooing era the measurements used to take them were provably ground based temperature readers that tend to vary widely. For NASA's reading of global temperatures has read a stead increase in global temperature by a total of 1 degree Fahrenheit. Though that fact may no seem scary that mere temperature change has huge ecological and weather ramifications. And if this trend continues and earths CO2 emission only increases than this temperature shift will increase at a quickening pace.  In relation to the hockey stick graph I looked into what the graph actually meant seeing as their was not labeling o the axis but what it does show is a 0.3 temperature drop per millennium. In the last 20 years the earth has had temperature increase of 1 degree Fahrenheit. Thus their is no way that the earth progressively moving away from the sun will effectively counteract climate change.  Also the effects of CFC's are very different than traditional greenhouse gases for this dangerous gas, for lack of a better term, eats up ozone and is largely responsible for the hole in the ozone layer that has slowly developed over the arctic circle. Thus it is a completely different and much more dangerous greenhouse gas than CO2 and Methane.  In relation to your graphs on overall greenhouse gas contribution I have not seen repeated in ever source I looked at with the average impact of Humans on global warming to be between 3 and 5 percent. Although this may not seem scary this small percentage change is several billion tons of CO2 that affect the rates of the greenhouse effective and over time( and i'm talking about hundreds of years) will lead to exponential temperature growth. Right now it is linear but will only level out if mankind as a whole reduce carbon emissions or find some way to create balance between our CO2 creation and capturing. To see some of these solutions I recommend you watch the Nova special on global warming.</t>

    <t>You see as the human population increases the number extintions for different animals also increase due to our need for resources and the human population is growing and when the resources are used up we move on like a paracite. Extintion rates have been increasing because of this. You have provided one graph while I have provided several that say the same thing done by different sources and not NASA and the EPA which can be bias to your case. (If you wish to debate on the EPA we could do so when this debate is finished) It's the steadiness in the graph that makes me question the validity of the information while mine so both increases and decreases.  You have looked up the hockey stick graph, but I have shown that in my graphs that the hockey stick graph does not exist and that it is unlikely that the Earth is warming at all as I have shown in several graphs that the Earth's temperature is decreasing. I have shown that it is cooling and that the IPPC is incorrect on their Warming Predictions.  My opponent now brings up one theory relying on the Ozone hole, but this is incorrect as the World Health Organization (WHO) has found that the Ozone is actually getting thicker and is expected to make a great recovery by 2025 due to the banning of Hydrocarbons. My opponent attempts to refute the last graph that I had provided in my last round, but even though we are dumping large amounts of CO2, methane, and CFCs into the atmosphere they are contributing little to Global Warming. The graph shows how much it contributes not the quanitity and it shows that Water Vapor by far is more superior than that of CO2, Methane, and CFCs combined!</t>

    <t>Firstly I'm confused by your first graph which has nothing to do with the topic of global warming  I also don't think you understand my points on your graphs. Your graphs on temperature are either based on ice core temperatures which is imprecise when used as a measure of temperature especially over short periods of time which is what global warming demands as in order to study. Or your measurements are based on terrestrial based temperature readers which have been use by both anti global warming and anti global warming pundits because they are so chronically unreliable. The NASA measurements are the closest possible reliable source of information because they are taken from space which gives the the most complete view of the planet.  On the 'theory' that the ozone layer has developed hole above the arctic circle is not a theory because it has happened. And the hypothesis that the WHO presented does not account for CFC's that are being made in china and India  And in relation to the fact that water account for the greenhouse effect than other greenhouse gases is correct however I believe you are underestimating how much greenhouse gases is composed of three percent of all greenhouse gases (the percentage that is man made). For this 3% accounts for several billions of tons of greenhouse gas such as CO2 and methane that humans are putting in the atmosphere. This increase upsets the natural equilibrium of the greenhouse effect and in time will lead to an exponential increase in temperatures. over 97% of scientists agree with this theory and distrust of general scientific theory is only harmful to the continued existence of mankind.</t>

    <t>My first graph was showing the CO2 spike that Pro may be refuring to is from massive plant extintion and not from CO2 emmissions. As for satellite readings I give you the second and 5th chart from Round 2. These both are satellite imagings and they both show the same thing. That CO2 levels do not affect the atmosphere Much like the 2nd graph in Round 3 we can see that CO2 and even man-made at that matter has no affect and doesn't contribute to Global Warming as Water Vapor does. It also shows that the IPPC is incorrect and many of the NASA scientists are in the IPPC and this actually discredits their sourcing. The Ozonen hole is above the Antartic, not the artic. The graph does include the CFCs from third world nations. As for the CO2 gasses contributing, I know that there are billions of tons, but it still doesn't contibute to the Greenhouse effect even comparably close to Water Vapor. This shows that there is no corrilation between Warming and CO2.  Now as for those 97% of scientists that my opponent was talking about.  When it comes to scientists there are a total of 2,500 scientists that do believe in Global Warming, but when it comes to not believing in Global Warming there is a large amount that have signed a petition stating that they believe that Global Warming is a hoax.

    <t>My case is that global warming, the phenomena in which greenhouse gases and ozone destroying chemicals, is a prevalent problem that currently affects the global health of the plant. It has led to more a more deadly weather pattern, stronger storms, droughts a rising sea level, a hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica. If steps are not taken to reduce the emission of green house gases and other destructive chemicals that cause acceleration of the greenhouse effect the climate will progressively grow hotter and will lead to further drought, storms, and eventually making earth a inhospitable place or humans to live. Good luck to your counter argument. You don't need to sight your sources but be aware I will fact check everything you say.</t>

    <t>Thank you, opponent, for giving me a chance to debate with you. I hope this can be an enjoyable experience for the both of us.Arguments:1. Less people die.My opponent correctly suggests that, in recent years, children and infants have died less frequently from disease. This is due to great advances in medicine. However, those great advances in medicine have also brought other, much less desirable, effects.Thalidomide:Thalidomide was first sold in Germany as an over the country drug in 1957. It was used in the hopes that it would prevent morning sickness in pregnant women, which it did. Unfortunately, however, it had the side effect of deforming the limbs of unborn children whose Mothers had taken the drug. Of the 10,000 children born with limbs that were malformed because of the drug, only 5,000 survived. Thalidomide was a case of drug companies destroying the lives of 10,000 people without malicious intent. It was also, as my opponent will doubtlessly point out, over 50 years ago. Whilst this is true, there are much more recent, yet less infamous, issues with the advances of medicine which have undoubtedly made lives worse. One example of this is in a BBC news report from 2006:[1] 'Six men remain in intensive care after being taken ill during a clinical drugs trial in north-west London. The healthy volunteers were testing an anti-inflammatory drug at a research unit based at Northwick Park Hospital when they suffered a reaction. Relatives are with the patients, who suffered multiple organ failure. Two men are said to be critically ill.'This shows that the advancement of medicine has not necessarily made lives better, in fact, it could be said that, although more people now survive diseases, their quality of life is lower. An example of this would be the euthanasia debate.In the past, your doctor would help you survive disease until the point where you were in insufferable pain which could not be alleviated. At this point, your doctor could, and often would, make the decision to ease your passing with an overdose of drugs (normally morphine) with your consent. [2] 'Throughout classical antiquity, there was widespread support for voluntary death as opposed to prolonged agony, and physicians complied by often giving their patients the poisons they requested.'This was made illegal in the UK in 1961, meaning that those suffering from a painful, debilitating and terminal disease may not make the decision to end their life with help if they're unable to do it alone. This is not just in the UK, euthanasia is illegal in almost every country in the world.[3] 'As of 2014, euthanasia is only legal in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg.'Despite even this, the increase in world population is not inherently a good thing in itself. It has led to oppressive but necessary policies such as the Chinese one child policy, which has seen the murder of many young girls in the hopes that the parents will have a son. Thus, my argument is that whilst life expectancy has gotten longer, quality of life has not.2. Better technology for everybodyMy opponent again correctly suggests that technology has not only improved over the years, but has also become more available to the average peasant (citizen). However, this is not necessarily a good thing.My opponent asserts: 'Not to mention we have much cheaper methods than trains--with our new subways all around--and better airplanes--from Wright's first to now, fighter jets and humongous airliners-- transportation is cheaper, easier, and faster than ever. With better transportation, countries can trade more easier, and people can get from place to place easier as well. The world is definitely changing for the better with these technological innovations.'This is all very well and good, however, the increase in 'better transport' has massively increased the consumption of oil and other natural resources all around the world. Here we see the increase in diesel consumption per year in just the USA. This data only goes up to the year 1998, however, I can tell you that the fuel consumption in the year 2013 in just the USA [4]'about 134.51 billion gallons1 (or 3.20 billion barrels) of gasoline.'This tremendous increase in the use of natural resources has resulted in a tremendous increase in greenhouse gases emmitted into the atmosphere, notably carbon dioxide.As you can see here, the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased substantially from 1960-2010. This is resulting in a 'warming' on a global scale. An effect that is commonly known as 'global warming.'This has resulted in the extinction of countless species and will result in the extinction of countless more.[5]'Polar bears have started drowning as they have had to swim longer distances between ice flows, and the U.S. Geological Survey has predicted that if the Arctic ice cape continues melting at its current rate, “two-thirds of the world's polar bear sub-populations will be extinct by mid-century.”7 Of course, it is not just the polar bear that is affected—one study predicts that a quarter of land animals and plants could become extinct because of global warming over the next 45 years.8'[6]'Parmesan and most other scientists hadn't expected to see species extinctions from global warming until 2020. But populations of frogs, butterflies, ocean corals, and polar birds have already gone extinct because of climate change, Parmesan said.'My opponent implies that communication has become easier in the past few hundred years with the invention of increasingly better, more convenient and inexpensive telephones, right up to the mobile phone. I would agree with him, but that does not mean that the quality of communication has gone up. In fact, I would argue that the quality of communication has definitely gone down.I want to transport my reader back to a time that is no longer in living memory. A time where telephones did not exist and the easiest form of long-range communication was a letter. I want to transport my reader back to the 1830's, to a young girl called Victoria, who would later be known as Queen Victoria. She wished to write her sister, whom had gone to live with the Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, a letter. It had been many years since she had been allowed to see her sister, and after writing the letter she waited excitedly for a reply. Can you imagine her dismay when, a few days later, she opened an envelope addressed to her from her sister to see nothing but the letter 'K' written upon an almost blank piece of paper?This, of course, never happened. The cost of sending a letter, whilst not expensive, was costly enough to ensure detailed communication with ones friends and loved ones which invoked a feeling of closeness that is not as often seen in the communications of today. This is primarily because now, with the invention of social media and texting, it is so incredibly easy to lose the sense of connection that communication held in the time of letters. Lengthy and structured replies are no longer seen as important, formality is an art that is often no longer understood or seen to be necessary. The phenomenon of the 'K' response is often wrote about, it is well recognised for its rude abruptness, yet many people still continue to use it because, with the invention of easier communications, there is little practical reason not to. Thus, I argue that whilst the quantity of communication has increased, the quality of communication has gone down. As has, therefore, the quality of friendships and relationships.More arguments next round.</t>

    <t>I thank my opponent for accepting. Seeing how he is unbeatable, I'll make my arguments extra tough!*WARNING*: Lots of pictures. Don't blame me if I miss a picture that can't be seen. I can't make sure all of them remain pictures. Let's start off with the basics.1. Less people dieAs modern medicine is improving, less people die by disease. The two graphs below  show that fewer and fewer children are dying.  Just in case my opponent somehow accuses my source being 'biased', I shall provide another graph to back up my information:Japan? Japan's just being weird. :P Besides, it's such a small region, it doesn't really effect the overall resolution anyways. We don't really know whether Japan is changing for the better, but certainly the world is.Thus it is evident, we save lives of innocent children; the world is definitely changing for the better. Now onto argument number two...2. Better technology for everbodyAs the world progresses so does its transportation. Before we started off with the first car ever made...Now we have ultra-aerodynamic cars....s://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com...; alt='' width='708' height='398' /gt;They move gazillions time faster than the first car ever, and are far more efficient. Not to mention we have much cheaper methods than trains--with our new subways all around--and better airplanes--from Wright's first to now, fighter jets and humongous airliners-- transportation is cheaper, easier, and faster than ever. With better transportation, countries can trade more easier, and people can get from place to place easier as well. The world is definitely changing for the better with these technological innovations.Not only so, communication has improved much. Long long ago, we had to use the telegraph. Then we moved on to the first telephone ever.Then we had home phones...Cellphones...And finally, the iPhone!!From hard communication, to easier communication, to the addition of internet searches, GPS, and games, our communication device has improved much, and it has become more and more helpful as we have improved. We see the world changing for the better with technology's vast improvements.  3. Poor people are being helped Not only less people are dying, and less people are getting sick, people are getting better medical benefits. 'in 2002, only 230,000 people in the developing world were getting treatment with lifesaving but expensive antiretroviral medicines.' www.mistergui.com/downloads/The%20Case%20for%20Optimism.doc says. 'Today, in part because the pharmaceutical industry moved from being a low-volume, high-margin business to a low-margin, high-volume one with guaranteed payments, that number is 8 million. ' Not only so, ' in the 25 years leading up to the current economic crisis, more people worldwide moved from poverty to the middle class than at any other time in history.' The next page of this article, states. Now, why is this important, other than saving people's lives as said in the first argument? Well, you see, thievery is mostly due to poor people not being able to make enough money for themselves or their family, and thus forced to steal from others. But since they are helped and no longer have to pay so much for medication, they can delve their efforts into other parts of financial responsibility and steal less, if they even continue to steal. This argument also has another (surprising) side effect. It's actually not technically a side effect. It's actually a side related policy that caused to help out people. You see, Brazil managed to efficiently cut its deforestation rates by 75%. How does this have to do with helping poor people? Well you can't help people without sufficient economy right? So therefore Brazil cut down on its oil spending, creating new jobs to support the economy, and maximizing the hydropower. Brazil, in an effort to change its own economy, helps its people. This of course applies to most other countries as well. They want to help their government and society? They have to start with the people. Thus, governments in their attempt to grow in power and influence, inevitably improve people's lives--and the environment for the animals' lives-- for the better.  Now let's go to....4. Human rightsHumans are gaining more and more rights as revolutions and rebellions occur. From the overall natural rights of life, liberty and pursuit of happiness to the voting rights of all men, including blacks, then to the civil war, where slavery was finally abolished, and recently, women gaining 'equal treatment of women and men under the law and voting rights.' Thus we see here, the rights progress, from everyone having practically completely different statuses--white men, black men, and women--transform into the men versus woman movement, and finally our people as one. Nowadays, pretty much the only right that women don't have is topless rights. We're working on that, though. After some debate we'll come to a good conclusion and do women justice. I have like 2,500 characters left but I can't really think of anything I haven't covered. Technology improved and helps everyone in their usual lives. People's living styles improved--with their environment around them improving too- and they are also gaining more rights as they continue to fight for themselves. The world is definitely changing for the better.Onto you, mighty unbeaten JayConar.</t>

    <t>Let's see now... 1. Enthusiana debate Of course, enthusiana was the only treatment availible during olden days. Nowadays we have alternative options availible. With increasing methods to keep these people alive without their massive pain, we have better care and training. The easy way out would not allow us to help doctors increase their skills of caring for these terminally ill persons. Furthermore, people who choose enthusiana are usually depressed and only see the sad side, the burdened side of life. By not taking the easy way out, we can learn about their problems that might be effecting their decisions. Maybe one day the man lost his job and his spouse died by heart disease, and he's so depressed he think he's sick too, and the only way out is enthusiana. But that's not right. We can treat his depression, we can treat his illusion of sickness. If we instantly just terminate him without really finding out about his sickness, then it's immoral. Also, we cannot learn how to treat the specific sickness, if the patient is really sick. What if 1,000 more people die of disease X, and we didn't investigate the first person who obtained the disease, just killed him with enthusiana! We lose many chances at medical research that could save the lives of others. The doctor also earns far too much power in enthusiana, and his diagnosis could be wrong, as well as new research that could change the outcome. His emotion or tiredness could affect his decision; too much variables could contribute to an immoral death. There are many reasons why enthusiana isn't legalized in all of those countries my opponent mentioned. There's a reason my opponent sourced a majority of countries that prefer no enthusiana to legalizing enthusiana. 2. Better technology So what that we consume fuel? We seek other sources; renewable sources that are more efficient and are more environmental, gaining more energy in the process! Carbon dioxide increase: *Laughs* I was expecting this argument. Now, look at his graph. Tell me what's wrong with it. Nothing? Okay, look on the right side....that's right... it's merely from 310 to 390, and we're merely counting the years 1960-2010. This is what the graph would look like if we started from zero:  Eh, eh? Doesn't look so bad now eh? Seriously, that graph is biased. On the other hand, if we look at the bigger picture.... We see here, even if carbon dioxide is being released (not to mention, at very small rates), the global temperature is not effected by it. In fact, the temperature is still decreasing as shown over time. Since the earth has not warmed, my opponent cannot contribute it to the 'extinction of countless species'. As for arctic melting, that makes no sense. The arctic is not melting at all, it is, in fact, expanding. We see it is obvious, my opponent is wrong. Wherever he got the idea of global warming, we don't know. But it isn't happening. As for the letter, my opponent only shows how our world nowadays is much better in communication. You see, long ago people just wrote 'K'. I even heard of a famous story of a writer who wrote to her publishers, '?' concerning her novel, and the publishers responding, '!'. Seriously guys? Now, we don't have to pay for these letters. We can instantly send them by email or by cell phone, much more quickly. The world is much more interconnected with email and computers; two friends separated by 3,000 miles no longer have to wait one month for each other's letters to arrive, they can instantly talk to each other with only waiting a few seconds--or milliseconds--to respond to each other's messages, and even see each other through face time! As you can see here, my opponent's case defeats his own. Global temperature is actually cooling, not warming. Enthusiana is illegal for a good reason. He dropped almost all of my arguments, and I hope he comes back to rebut them later. Back to you, mighty unbeaten Jay!</t>

    <t>My friend's argument relies on two things:1. Euthanasia is wrong in all circumstances.2. Global warming does not exist EuthanasiaMy opponent asserts that: 'enthusiana was the only treatment availible during olden days.' This statement is incorrect. Although my opponent was vague due to not explaining what he means by 'olden days' I'm going to assume he means classical antiquity.There were a number of medical textbooks in classical antiquity, as well as a number of famous physician's such as Paul of Aegina, whom wrote the '[1]Epitomes iatrikes biblio hepta'Surgery was also available as a treatment in antiquity.'If the wounded man or his companions attempted to extract an arrow by pulling on the shaft, there was a good chance that the arrowhead itself would be left within the wound. Celsus and Paul of Aegina offer step-by-step instructions that S. says would have been useful'.Thus euthanasia was not the only treatment available in antiquity, and would also only have been used on somebody who was in a terminal condition and was, therefore, suffering unbearable amounts of pain which would only lead to death anyway. My opponent has not offered a rebuttal for why euthanasia should not be used in cases such as this when, often, modern painkillers won't even take the edge off of pain that occurs when somebody is dying as to do so would mean giving the patient an overdose of one or another drug, which would be euthanising them. The argument sort of loops around like that.Global WarmingMy opponent asserts that: 'even if carbon dioxide is being released (not to mention, at very small rates), the global temperature is not effected by it.'My opponent has decided to argue that global warming does not exist. In doing this he decides to use this graph as evidence:We cannot be sure from exactly where my opponent found this graph, however, we can be sure that there is definitely a positive correlation as, with time, the PPM (Parts per million) of Carbon Dioxide steadily increases. This graph has been scaled all the way back to 1900 in order to make the positive correlation seem weaker, however the positive correlation is still extant. Therefore my opponent has worked to prove my point.My opponent asserts that the absorption of more Carbon Dioxide into the air does not effect the global temperature. To prove this he puts up a picture of the ice caps in September 2013 and September 2012.As we can see here, the global temperature does vary by about 0.2 of a degree quite frequently. However, the average global temperature has definitely increased exponentially since 1980 relative to 1880-1980. This suggests that there is a positive correlation between carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the global temperature. But a correlation does not necessarily suggest a causual relationship, so let's have a look at the science.'[3]Most of the light energy from the sun is emitted in wavelengths shorter than 4,000 nanometers (.000004 meters).  The heat energy released from the earth, however, is released in wavelengths longer than 4,000 nanometers.  Carbon dioxide doesn't absorb the energy from the sun, but it does absorb some of the heat energy released from the earth.  When a molecule of carbon dioxide absorbs heat energy, it goes into an excited unstable state.  It can become stable again by releasing the energy it absorbed.  Some of the released energy will go back to the earth and some will go out into space.'Thus global warming as a result of Carbon Dioxide is a very real thing which we should all be scared of and wouldn't have happened if not for the technological advancement in transport which Pro attempts to paint in a positive light. Back to you, Pro.</t>

Thus, I have rebutted my opponents points successfully and he had the BoP to prove that the world is actually changing for the better, he did not fulfill his BoP as I rebutted all his arguments. My opponent asserts that:'and refuting them in the last round would be unfair, and he would have to have a conduct point lost),'Yet he used the entirety of his last round refuting my rebuttals in which he essentially claims that pain does not exist as the brain is just tricking it (which is true, the brain is what makes you feel pain, but that does not stop an individual from suffering. If you stab yourself then it doesn't matter how much you think 'it's just my brain sending signals,' it will still hurt), and claiming that global warming is due to solar activity and not carbon dioxide which, as we can seeIt's not. As for danger levels of CO2 not being reached until it reaches 8,000 PPM, allow me to read you the entire quote which my opponent harmfully cut to pieces:'[1]He also said that higher CO2 levels are not harmful to humans. As an example, he said that Earth's atmosphere currently has about 338 parts per million of CO2 and that in Navy subs, the danger level for carbon dioxide isn't reached until the air has 8,000 parts per million of CO2.' The CO2 levels may not be harmful to humans, but that is not the argument, the argument is that the variance in the temperature caused by the warming which is caused by the CO2 increase in the atmosphere is harmful, and has led to the extinction, of many species, which I proved in a previous round.It should be mentioned that source 1 was also published in 2009, 5 years ago, scientific views change very quickly so something which was posted 5 years ago is incredibly out of date.Most of my opponent's last round is him, essentially, being irrelevant. Stating that pain is a mental process does not mean that people cannot be in insufferable pain and stating that you have won does not mean that you have won.

    <t>Contention 1: No Major/any CO2 Increase.      My opponent states that CO2 levels have never been this high, but that is incorrect. I give you the above graph measuring the past 600 million years of CO2 levels are we are actually at an all time low. Now the website I got this from no longer has this page up so I appologize. We can see from observance of this graph that we being at all time CO2 low levles that we are nowhere close to meeting the impact that my opponent brings up. We have been over 5,000 ppm of CO2 in our atmosphere and are now currently around apprx. 350 ppm CO2 levels.  The above graph shows that comparisions of C13 (Carbon isotope) and this shows that there is little to no trend pertrade in many of these as the average is zero while the trend for all of these are zero. This is important as the Carbon isotope is important in measuring this so called 'Global Warming.'  This chart above shows the CO2 and Earth's temperatures for the past 600 million years. My opponent's claims are incorect as we have had aburd levels of CO2 and temperature on Earth and may I ask how did we survive that? Now I will move on to how Earth is actually cooling and how it's temperature is cooler than it has been. Contention 2: Earth is cooling.  If we observe the above graph we can see that Earth has been a whole lot hotter than where we currently are to the point where the Earth's average temperature has been 7.5 degrees Celcuis hotter than it currently it is. You can also see that in the span of the past 10,000 years the temperature has leveld off, but you may ask yourself where does that place us in the lights of modern day? You can also see that Pro's graph is actually in the 500 to 10 thousand years before present and we can see that fallowing those trends that the temperature has actually leveled off.   I am going to site Dr. Done Easterbrook, who is a climate scientist. Back in 2000 he predicted that Earth was entering a cooling phase. He predicts that for the next 20 years Earth will cool by 3/10 degree each year and that we are going to enter another little Ice Age like we did from 1650 and 1790. The funny thing is that many of my opponent's charts are actually from the incorrect IPPC.  How about the 'Hockey Stick' graph that many Global Warming supporters , including my opponent, argue about? Well if we observe the fallowing chart taken from Northern Scandenavia we can see that the Global trend over the past 1,000 years that the Global Cooling trend slope is that of -0.31 Degrees Celcuis, give or take 0.03 degrees (for the error room). Professor Dr. Jan Esper has found that the Earth's temperature of Earth actually decreases 0.3 per millenia due to the Earth moving away from the sun. Here is another graph from 1920 to 2005 and we can see that the graph has a negative temperature slope, thus meaning that the Earth is under a period of cooling.Contention 3: Artic Ice. First, I would like to state that Pro's claim about the North Pole completely melting is bogus.  Al Gore stated that the Artic Ice would be completely melted by 2014, but he is incorrect then and now.   Jan. 6, 2012: The Coast Guard Cutter Healy breaks ice around the Russian-flagged tanker Renda 250 miles south of Nome. The Healy is the Coast Guard’s only currently operating polar icebreaker. The vessels are transiting through ice up to five-feet thick in this area. The 370-foot tanker Renda will have to go through more than 300 miles of sea ice to get to Nome, a city of about 3,500 people on the western Alaska coastline that did not get its last pre-winter fuel delivery because of a massive storm. Let's go back to 2007-2008 and see if his claim was justified in the Artic Ice activity.  Hmmm... It seems that he is incorrect, but let's look further into the near past. How about 2012-2013? We all remember the Climate Scientists that got stuck in Arctic Ice Earlier this year correct? Then a Russian Ice Breaker tried to free them, but got stuck. Can you guess what they were studying? They had predicted that all the Arctic Ice had melted due to Global Warming and that Earth would get flooded massively. Boy were they wrong. How about Al Gore. The man who brought Global Warming to our attention? In 2009, the man breaks down in tears stating how it's nothing, but hot air and how he fabricated everything just for the money! He said the arctic sheets are not melting and CO2 is not responsible for depletion of the Ozone. Dr. Koonin, former head of the Department of Energy under President Obama, has stated that the Global Warming scare is not suttle. This is because that he has found 3 things wrong and highly incorrect about the scare. 1. Shrinking of Artic Sea ice doesn't acount for the gaining of the Antartic ice. 2. The warming of Earth's temps today is the same as it was 30 years ago. 3. The sea levels rose at the same height and rate in the 20th cenury. Contention 4: Sea Levels  Here is another corralation that must happen. If the Ice Caps are completely melted as Pro claims then the sea level would have risen completely drowning tons of land.  The graph above is raw satellite image data of the sea level rise over an 8 year period showing that there is little to no change in the Sea Levels rising. The sea level rises, on average, about 3 inches per century and it has been found to not even been rising at all.  This graph is the sea levels off the cost of French Guyana which is one of the areas which is predicted to be flooded due to Global Warming, but as you can see by the graph (which goes to 2008) the sea level is currently on a downward trend.</t>

Here are websites that tie together co2 and temperature, and debunks any claims about why co2 and temperature carbon are not always tightly correlated. There's no question that temperature and CO2 is correlated. You can see that in the links i provided, historically. Here is that they are more than just correlated, but tied together.

The volcano theorists can't even keep their stories straight. In his book, Limbaugh claims that the 1991 Pinatubo eruption put 1000 times as much chlorine into the atmosphere as industry has ever produced through CFCs; yet on Nightline, Pinatubo is alleged to have produced 570 times the equivalent of one year's worth of CFCs. Both can't be right. It turns out neither are. The figure 570 apparently derives from Ray's book--but she said it was Mount Augustine, an Alaskan volcano that erupted in 1976, that put out 570 times as much chlorine as one year's worth of CFCs. Ray's source is a 1980 Science magazine article--but that piece was actually talking about the chlorine produced by a gigantic eruption that occurred 700,000 years ago in California (Science, 6/11/93).' '--------- I'd also add, that the common sense answer to me is... consider all the smoke stacks out there. Consider all the pollution, places like LA. I'd bet California itself is like a volcano very short period in intervals. doesn't this make the most sense, considering how little and how infrequent volcanoes erupt? ----------  Scientific article saying the sun is only accounting for a third of our warming ------------- QUOTE With respect to global warming, though solar activity has been at relatively high levels during the recent period, the fact that solar activity has been near constant during the last 30 years precludes solar variability from playing a large role in recent warming. It is estimated that the residual effects of the prolonged high solar activity account for between 18 and 36% of warming from 1950 to 1999  ^ Stott, Peter A.; Gareth S. Jones and John F. B.

We are setting records at a more frequent basis. -If we look at natural temperature increases... we see we've been increasing for thousands of years. But, we see that it's been accelerating in recent history, particularly the industrial revolution where pollution occurs. This is in reference to the infamous 'hockey stick' graph. No, we can't deduce from that alone that we're the cause, but we can give it as supporting the fact that there's an accelerated increase, especially at our time. -Studies have been done that show CO2 being a cause of warming. we might squabble about how much warming, but we know it causes some.</t>

    <t>Round 2IntroductionFirst off, I would like to thank my opponent for displaying interest in this debate. I am eager to debate such an experienced member of this site. For my argument I would first off like to define a few terms as it is likely that they will be used several times by both debaters. Global warming: a gradual increase in the overall temperature of the earth's atmosphere.Greenhouse effect: the trapping of the sun's warmth in a planet's lower atmosphere.Carbon Dioxide (CO2): a colorless, odorless gas produced by burning carbon and organic compounds and by respiration.Fossil Fuels: a natural fuel such as coal or gas, formed in the geological past from the remains of living organisms.With the definitions aside, let the debating begin!How does the greenhouse effect work? Before I begin defending the premise defined in the first round, I would like to clarify how the process called the greenhouse effect works. This is essential to the topic of global warming, as the greenhouse effect is the process which warms the planet, especially during the nigh time. When sunlight reaches the earths atmosphere it changes into thermal radiation. Most of this thermal radiation is reflected off back into space due to the earth's atmosphere, however some manages to enter the planet. Once it reaches the atmosphere, it comes down to the surface, still as light, and is converted into energy through the process of photosynthesis. Eventually this energy is transferred from the plant to a primary or secondary consumer when the plant/producer is eaten by the consumer. Due to a concept called the 10% rule, almost all of the energy (90%) is lost during the transfer from producer to consumer and is radiated back into the atmosphere as heat [1]. Some of this heat manages to leave the atmosphere and goes off to space where it becomes essentially useless. A small percent of the heat, however, is trapped by the greenhouse gases (such as CO2, CH4, N2O, etc) and is kept in the atmosphere [2]. This is important because during the nigh time when the sun is not providing heat, the heat preserved by the greenhouse gases keep the planets surface warm [3]. This generally should be considered a good thing, however in this case there can be to much of a good thing. Due to the fact that there is now an abundance of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, especially carbon dioxide, too much heat is being trapped in the atmosphere and as a result global temperatures have risen. I will attempt to prove that the reason for this abundance of greenhouse gases and as a result increased global temperatures is a result of human actions, and it is not a 'natural' occurrence. Graph A shows the basic process of the greenhouse effect. Graph A: Argument structureMy argument will follow this basic format: P1) The increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is a result of human actions. P2) Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes an increase in global temperatures. P3) Therefore human beings are responsible for global warming. P1) The increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is a result of human actions. This is not a very difficult subject to defend and consequently it is not a very controversial subject, therefore I will be brief. Since the industrial revolution in the mid 1800's more and more carbon dioxide has been released into the atmosphere. Graph B shows the rapid increase in carbon emmisions starting in 1850. Graph B:The reason for this is obvious, due to rapid increasing of industry and technology, burning of fossil fuels has become more and more frequent. Due to the fact that the burning of fossil fuels emits carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, it is also obvious that the increased amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is a result of human activity. P2) Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes an increase in global temperatures. This is a much more controversial subject, and therefore I will spend the majority of my argument in this section. Given that the greenhouse effect states that greenhouse gases trap heat, and re radiate it in all directions, as shown in Graph A, it would be easy to make the assumption that if there is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere there would be less long wave radiation (the type of heat that CO2 absorbs) being emitted into space and more infrared radiation being emitted back to the earth. This, as a result, would heat up the world and cause global warming. To prove this hypothesis, NASA launched the IRIS satellite in 1970 to record the amount of long wave radiation being emitted into space over a 26 year period [4]. What they found supported the hypothesis that less long wave radiation was being emitted into space and as result their was more infrared being contained in the earth. Graph C displays the results of the experiment.Graph C:This graph is an infrared spectrum and it shows the frequencies of infrared light (800 to 1600 cm-1). The graph has multiple greenhouse gases (such as CO2 and CH4) and based on their position on the graph, it determines the frequency of infrared light that they absorb. For example CO2 is at the far end of the spectrum because it absorbs lower frequency light than CH4 (methane), which is at the far end of the spectrum. The graph shows the difference of the amount of infrared radiation that is being absorbed by the various greenhouse gases between 1970 and 1996. Due to the fact that there is a greater variation in both CO2 and CH4 it shows that there is more radiation being absorbed by those two gases. In simpler terms, this shows that there is more heat being trapped by carbon dioxide and methane then there used to in the past, and therefore as a result global warming is a result of the carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere. If these gases are the cause of global warming than it can also be determined that human beings are the cause of global warming because they are the ones that are emitting the CO2 and CH4 into the atmosphere. Moving on to the next graph, Graph D is representing the amount of infrared radiation at the earth's surface. Graph D:This graph is somewhat less complex than Graph C (thankfully). What it is representing is once again the infrared radiation spectrum (600-1800 cm-1) and the greenhouse gases that trap the radiation at certain spectrums. CO2 is found and approximately 800 cm-1 and consequently there is a much higher amount of infrared radiation at 800 cm-1 at the earths surface than there is of any other wave frequency. What this means is that carbon dioxide is responsible for the majority of the heat being contained in the earth. By extension, this means that carbon dioxide is causing global warming and that it is once again human beings fault due to the fact that we are the ones emitting the CO2 into the atmosphere. Now moving on to the final graph. Graph E is showing both the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and also the global temperatures. Graph E:What Graph E is conveying is that there is a huge amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere currently, much higher than there has ever been in the past. Now there are three important things to note in this graph. One is that throughout the course of history, whenever global temperatures increased, the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere had increased as well. This allows us to reach the conclusion that the more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the higher temperatures will be. The second thing to note is that in none of the historical situations did global temperatures increase at the exact same time that the carbon dioxide levels. In every situation the temperatures took several years to rise following an increase in carbon dioxide levels. This is important because it shows global warming skeptics, like my opponent, that global temperatures will not increase right away. This is why temperatures have not increased so rapidly yet, however given the trend of this graph they are certain to increase in the near future. The final thing to note is the huge amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today. In no situation in history has their been such a high amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and the only explanation for why this is is human activity. Global warming skeptics claim that we cannot know that it is human being fault for global warming, however this chart shows the contrary. P3) Therefore humans are responsible for global warmingI have proved that carbon dioxide is the primary reason for why their has been increases in global temperatures as of late. This negates skeptics major arguments about why global warming is not human beings fault because it is clear that carbon dioxide emittions are due to human beings, and therefore it can be concluded that human beings are the cause of global warming.</t>
<h>    Round 2IntroductionFirst off, I would like to thank my opponent for displaying interest in this debate.</h>

    <t>Round 3Contention 1: Increased CO2 levels are from human actionThere are two issues regarding my opponents argument, which I will address. 1) How can anthro account for such a rapid spike in carbon dioxide levels? The primary argument that global warming skeptics present for the increase in carbon dioxide levels is that it is a natural occurrence. The issue with this argument is that throughout the 4.5 billion years in which the earth has existed the carbon dioxide levels have never spiked so rapidly [1]. It is unlikely that such a drastic change in the earth's atmosphere would only occur one in 4.5 billion years. Graph F displays the rapid increase of carbon dioxide levels. Graph F:2) Industrial Revolution correlation Using Graph B from the first round as reference, it is shown that the spike of carbon dioxide levels correlates flawlessly with the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the mid 1800's. I would like to ask my opponent, is it simply a coincidence that this is the case? In my opinion, find this incredibly unlikely. Dr. Roy Spencer has not addressed either of these issues with his hypothesis, and therefore I conclude that we should not consider Dr. Spencer's research as legitimate. Contention 2: CO2 in the atmosphere causes increased temperatures. Acknowledging that carbon dioxide traps heat, and yet it has no correlation with increased global temperatures is both illogical and not scientific. Noting that global temperatures have always increased when carbon dioxide levels increase, how does my opponent explain the increase of global temperatures this time? Also, arguing that global temperatures have been hotter in the past makes no sense. This is due to the fact that the earth was once essentially a ball of fire. For the case of the graph, however, the global temperatures that are 7.5 degrees Celsius higher than the present were during a time of natural warming. Modern days, we are technically in an ice age. This makes it even more impressive that are temperatures are increasing, and while it is possible that it is simply a natural interglacial period, however I will disprove this using Graph G. Graph G:This graph shows the global temperatures for the past 400,000 years. In every single interglacial period, the temperatures drop nearly instantly after the spike. However in the modern 'interglacial period' the high temperatures have remained high and have not dropped following a spike. This implies that this is not a natural interglacial period and therefore must be considered that it is occurring due to human influence. As for Dr. Don Eastbrook, I don't understand how he can claim that the earth is cooling while every graph suggests the contrary. For Dr. Jan Esper, does this not support global warming? If the earth is supposed to naturally cool, then how can it be explained that the earth is warming? It suggests that the earth is warming due to human actions as opposed to natural reasons. For the graph presented, it is a generic graph which global warming skeptics often present. The problem with this graph is that the information is skewed to support the claim that the earth is cooling. Graph H represents how skeptics skew the data while Graph I presents how global warming believers view the data. Graph H:Graph I:In Graph H, it is clear that the temperature pattern is increasing, however skeptics take a very small portion of the graph to 'prove' that temperatures are decreasing. Graph I shows a more accurate representation of how global temperatures should be graphed. The arctic ice increase is a far more controversial subject, however. There are two theories for why the sea ice is increasing, despite global warming. One theory involves an increase in wind due to the hole in the ozone layer. The theory states that with increased wind, the wind pushes more ice out into the ocean. Due to the ice being farther out in the ocean then the surrounding water cools and therefore freezes. This theory relies on global warming due to the fact that the increased winds are a result of ozone depletion, which is a result of increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere [2]. The second theory also relies on global warming, more specifically, increased sea levels. With an increased amount of warm water, the ice in the poles melts faster. This adds cool, fresh water into the ocean, which while does not lower temperatures to a freezing point, does create conditions suitable for freezing. Therefore, if temperatures decrease enough, the ocean will freeze over rapidly and farther out than in most situations [3]. In both of these situations, the increase in arctic ice relies on global warming, therefore disproving my opponents hypothesis that global warming cannot exist. As for Al Gore, he obviously doesn't know what he is talking about, based on my and other scientists arguments.</t>

  <pair id="503" entailment="NONENTAILMENT" task="IE">
    <t>I thank my opponent for giving me this chance to debate this with him. I will leave you a funny political cartoon about Global Warming before we get started.  Contention 1: Increased CO2 levels are from Human Action Here I shall actually be arguing that a great amount of CO2 levels are actually anthro, thus meaning that his increase in CO2 is natural.  In a recent study done by Dr. Roy Spencer, he has found that the atmospheric temperature is more likely coming from anthropogenic CO2 rising up from sinks. He found that the above model is consitant of 61% anthropogenic, 22% ocean temperature, and finially 17% land temperature which accounts for the CO2 emmissions from Fossil Fuels. The above graph shows that comparisions of C13 (Carbon isotope) and this shows that there is little to no trend pertrade in many of these as the average is zero while the trend for all of these are zero. Contention 2: C02 in the atmosphere causes Increased Temperatures. I agree that CO2 can absorb heat, but I shall be arguing that there is no corralation here between increased CO2 and Increased Temperatures.  If we observe the above graph we can see that Earth has been a whole lot hotter than where we currently are to the point where the Earth's average temperature has been 7.5 degrees Celcuis hotter than it currently it is. You can also see that in the span of the past 10,000 years the temperature has leveld off, but you may ask yourself where does that place us in the lights of modern day?  I am going to site Dr. Done Easterbrook, who is a climate scientist. Back in 2000 he predicted that Earth was entering a cooling phase. He predicts that for the next 20 years Earth will cool by 3/10 degree each year and that we are going to enter another little Ice Age like we did from 1650 and 1790. How about the 'Hockey Stick' graph that many Global Warming supporters argue about? Well if we observe the fallowing chart taken from Northern Scandenavia we can see that the Global trend over the past 1,000 years that the Global Cooling trend slope is that of -0.31 Degrees Celcuis, give or take 0.03 degrees (for the error room). Professor Dr. Jan Esper has found that the Earth's temperature of Earth actually decreases 0.3 per millenia due to the Earth moving away from the sun. We all remember the Climate Scientists that got stuck in Arctic Ice Earlier this year correct? Then a Russian Ice Breaker tried to free them, but got stuck. Can you guess what they were studying? They had predicted that all the Arctic Ice had melted due to Global Warming and that Earth would get flooded massively. Boy were they wrong. Heck even the Artic ice is growing. The Artic ice also increased from 2012-2013 as well. How about Al Gore. The man who brought Global Warming to our attention? In 2009, the man breaks down in tears stating how it's nothing, but hot air and how he fabricated everything just for the money! He said the arctic sheets are not melting and CO2 is not responsible for depletion of the Ozone.  Dr. Koonin, former head of the Department of Energy under President Obama, has stated that the Global Warming scare is not suttle. This is because that he has found 3 things wrong and highly incorrect about the scare. 1. Shrinking of Artic Sea ice doesn't acount for the gaining of the Antartic ice. 2. The warming of Earth's temps today is the same as it was 30 years ago. 3. The sea levels rose at the same height and rate in the 20th cenury.  Contention 3: Therefore humans are not responsable for Global Warming. I have shown that there is no trend between CO2 and tempterature rising. I have show that the Earth is actually cooling and that the current supposed rise that my opponent is talking about is actually from anthropogenics. Thus this resolution is negated.</t>

    <t>Contention 1: CO2 increase from humans  My opponent states that CO2 levels have never been this high, but that is incorrect. I give you the above graph measuring the past 600 million years of CO2 levels are we are actually at an all time low. Now the website I got this from no longer has this page up so I appologize. We can see from observance of this graph that we being at all time CO2 low levles that we are nowhere close to meeting the impact that my opponent brings up. We have been over 5,000 ppm of CO2 in our atmosphere and are now currently around apprx. 350 ppm CO2 levels.  This chart above shows the CO2 and Earth's temperatures for the past 600 million years. My opponent's claims are incorect as we have had aburd levels of CO2 and temperature on Earth and may I ask how did we survive that? My opponent tries to discard Dr. Spencer's evidence, because he doesn't appear to have a hypothesis, but that is not grounds to disqualify evidense as his findings were clear, so I extend them across the board.   Contention 2: CO2 in atmosphere = increased temperatures. My opponent is under a great misconceptions as I acknowledge that CO2 traps heat, but I am simply arguing that Earth's temperature is not increasing, but is actually decreasing. To counter my opponent's first graph I'll reitterate my first graph of C2 in my last round. To see what my opponent does not show you is that the span between 0 AD- Present and you'll see an almost constant temperature. Humans have been on Earth for millions of years and the fact that it's nearly constant from a non-industrial era where there were no machines what-so-ever to present shows that there is no major change that my opponent change. My opponent question Dr. Eastbrock, but brings up no valid counterevidence other than Dr. Esper. Dr. Eastbrook naturally cools and ever since 2000 we have been in a cooling range. We have also seen how the IPP projections are incorrect. My opponent then tries to blatantly claim that Global Warming evidence that I have provided is skewed, but if that is true let's look at a graph from 1975 to 2010 it appears to have a positive slope, but let's back track a little back and make it a 1920-2005 graph since it would seem that it would only make the graph appear to have a steeper positive slope, right? Well that is where we are wrong.  Here we see that the graph protrays a negative slope. My opponent now brings up one theory relying on the Ozone hole and southern winds, but this is incorrect as the World Health Organization (WHO) has found that the Ozone is actually getting thicker and is expected to make a great recovery by 2025 due to the banning of Hydrocarbons. The graph above is raw satellite image data of the sea level rise over an 8 year period showing that there is little to no change in the Sea Levels rising. (The sea level rises, on average, about 3 inches per century and it has been found to not even been rising at all.  This graph is the sea levels off the cost of French Guyana which is one of the areas which is predicted to be flooded due to Global Warming, but as you can see by the graph (which goes to 2008) the sea level is currently on a downward trend. The source is the PDF within the link. I have disproved both situations. Gore is one of the many who spread great awareness for Global Warming and he won the Nobel Peace Prize for it, but hen admitted that it's a scam to get money. That's a same. THank you for a great debate and please vote Con.</t>

<h>I thank my opponent for their opening round. While I'll make some general comments as to the trend of the debate, I will refrain from posting actual rebuttals until the subsequent round, as per the Instigator's rules.I am actually astounded at the position presented. I was expecting graphs, tables and data. Instead, we have been presented a point of view, which is axiomatic of the anti-climate change position. We have been presented an opinion. To open my case, let me make something robustly clear. Science does not function on the basis of opinion, and to present opinion is to concede evidence. Science is apolitical.As it stands, I agree with Pro on one point: don't follow the crowd. Instead, follow the peer-reviewed scientific literature. I take substantial grievance with the sources provided by Pro but unfortunately am constrained by the rules not to explain their absurdity until the following round. Rest assured that they will be thoroughly scrutinised and I intend to tear them apart.Onto the evidence. It's not two-sidedThe popular Western narrative is to provide 'unbiased coverage' of stories. In most cases, this is important. However, on science topics, opinion has nothing to do with anything. Facts are facts. Something is either true, or not true, and the only thing that we can use to determine whether something is true is evidence. To have two people on a talk-show, one a climate scientist and one an ostensible nobody claiming that climate scientists are the devil's children and work for multinationals is patently absurd because it misrepresents the scientific consensus (discussed below). It is not a 50/50 split. Evidence favours anthropogenic climate change, and stuffing our fingers in our ears will not refute this. If you want to disprove climate change, you must use evidence.ConsensusOf course, it would be an argument from popularity to stipulate that purely because the majority thinks something, it is true. It amounts to a special form of anecdotal evidence. However, it's a good place to start looking at why the independent scientific community agrees. As it happens, 97% of peer-reviewed papers published on the topic have found that humans are causing substantial changes to climate (1). The scientific community is clear. There is no 'teaching the controversy' because there is no controversy (2). Stop making science political because agendas don't change facts.Yeah, but, like, the climate has changed before and stuff...or whateverTrue. But not like this (3). It appears that there have been around 5 ice ages in earth's past (4). There have also been other variations in climate not related to ice ages. However, let's talk about anthropogenic climate change. The hypothesis is that as CO2 increases, we should see a general increase in global temperatures. Is this the case?Well, it would appear so. But have statistical controls accounted for extraneous variables and clarified that this is anthropogenic?Well, yeah, they kinda have. Despite attempts at finding plausible natural explanations for the climate variation, no natural fluctuations account for the observed trends (5).Rounding offThe scientific illiteracy of climate conspiracy theorists is a fundamental contributor to their perpetuation of the disinformation agenda of the corporate elite. While I obviously have substantially more evidence and could potentially just post hundreds of links to peer-reviewed journals, I prefer the argumentation. Perhaps this is sufficient for my introduction, and we'll clash next round with increased vigour when I can rebut your arguments.Best of luck in your following round.</h>

    <t>I personally am for the fact that man-made global warming does not exist, and that the earth is simply going through an ice age. Let me explain, an ice age goes through two phases. The first one is the obvious 'freezing' phase and the second phase is a predominantly warm one(see link 1). We are obviously in the predominantly warm phase, but going back into the cold phase. At both poles there is rapidly growing ice. I as a conservative taking the harder side to argue must work very hard to convince the public, while my partner must simply keep them on his side.

Far from constructing baseless ad hominem conjectures against my opponent, I simply deconstructed common mistakes regarding anthropogenic climate change that are made by climategate proponents. My opponent does not genuinely feel disrespected; they recognise that their position is untenable and that the belief that has been instilled in them by their right-wing, science-hating parents does not reflect anything close to observation. You're not offended; you just know you're wrong.My objective is now not to convince you, which I have already done, but to convince our audience. Rebuttals from first roundMy opponent stated that, '[...]an ice age goes through two phases. The first one is the obvious 'freezing' phase and the second phase is a predominantly warm one(see link 1).'While this isn't quite what the source indicates, it's basically right. There are periods of glaciation, and periods of warming. Cooling and warming are not uniform. I'd just like to quickly examine the way you've phrased this, though. Basically you're saying, it gets cold, then it gets warm. Well, obviously. If it stayed cold, we'd still be in an ice age. If it stayed warm, there'd never be ice ages. That's not helpful information.You then say, '[we are] going back into the cold phase.' Erm, nope.  I mean, we are getting cooler...if by cooler, you mean the temperature is rising.You then said, 'At both poles there is rapidly growing ice.'Your article goes on a right-wing binge-fest with absolutely no understanding of why that is happening. It makes specific reference to Antarctica. Yes. Sea ice is growing. This is because of strengthening westerly winds blowing sheets of snow and cold air further from the coast of the Antarctic continent(1). The strengthening winds are one indication of climate change(1). Further, while the sea ice spreads in geographic area, global ocean and atmospheric temperatures continue to increase. Looking at the data for a single year (i.e. we hit a record this year) is not indicative of trend. This mistake is confusing weather for climate, and is a common error. You're also looking at a single factor in isolation, and ignoring the rest of the data.Here's an informative video by Veritasium who describes the process and debunks some myths with the aid of some fun animations: https://www.youtube.com...The preponderance of the evidenceThe preponderance of the evidence, the consensus of the scientific literature, the data: 'The Earth’s climate is changing rapidly as a result of anthropogenic carbon emissions, and damaging impacts are expected to increase with warming' (Knutti amp; Hegerl, 2008)(2).Once again, if you wish to demonstrate that the models are incorrect, then you must supply the evidence that climate change is not occurring. Your reasons for doubting the science are political. Wanting something to be true or false has no bearing on whether it is true or false.

This has not yet been done, and if last round is anything to go by, I suspect my opponent will concede defeat. However, it would be interesting to hear his take. So, I ask you the following questions:- What is your evidence for the hoax?- Who initiated the hoax?- Why did they initiate it?

It can be seen that Stefan is open to differing opinions, and respects them if they are presented in a calm and non-aggressive manner. This forum thread {1} is an example of a post in which Stefan is directly said to be wrong on an important issue, and, in it, Stefan replies with, quote, “Thank you so much for the information, I had no idea, I really appreciate you sharing, I will have a look in detail[.]”2.     Most, if not all, of the videos in the playlist you linked that were taken down as a result of copyright claims by FDR only consisted of the audio from FDR shows with occasional captioning and commentary in text-form. These videos clearly violate copyright law, and, regardless of Stefan’s opinion on IP rights, it cannot be said that taking them down is “suppressing dissent” or is “cultlike behaviour”. At worst, you are accusing him of being a hypocrite – that does not help you in fulfilling your BOP.      In response to the “Insane/Cultish Claims”  1.  Just for the record, Stefan has publically recanted his views on homosexuality that you mentioned {2}.                                  2.   The majority of the claims on your list are just said to be “insane/cultish”, with no justification as to why this is so (and, with your definition of “cult leader”, I don’t see how any of these directly support the idea that FDR is a cult), just that they are supported by Molyneux. No reasons are given for most of the claims as to why they aren’t valid, as if they are just to be accepted as being such because of some self-evident nature they possess. Even if they were completely and utterly debunked, it would be irrelevant to the debate – one is not a “cult leader”, even by the definition given by PRO, just because they support unorthodox or irrational ideas. As such, these videos do nothing to further the fulfillment of the BOP by PRO, and I do not need to respond any further to them.     In response to Stefan’s support of DEFOO-ing I must ask, if the idea of DEFOO-ing is cult-like, would it not follow that most of the modern western world would be cultists? Stefan does NOT universally support DEFOO-ing - he does not want all children to disassociate themselves from their families. He advocates doing so in the cases of emotional or physical abuse – this is to be done for the child’s own sake, not in order for them to be “better devoted” to Molyneux or whatever other sinister theory. Molyneux is applying the concept of a battered spouse leaving the abuser to familial relationships. There is nothing more “cult-like” about this than there is about women supporting that wives who are being consistently harmed should leave the source of the harm, if they can. It is baseless to assert that Stefan is a cult-leader because of this.      {1} https://board.freedomainradio.com... {2} https://www.youtube.com...</h>

    <t>According to the website culteducation.com here are the warning signs for a cult leader:  Absolute authoritarianism without meaningful accountability. No tolerance for questions or critical inquiry. No meaningful financial disclosure regarding budget, expenses such as an independently audited financial statement. Unreasonable fear about the outside world, such as impending catastrophe, evil conspiracies and persecutions. There is no legitimate reason to leave, former followers are always wrong in leaving, negative or even evil. Former members often relate the same stories of abuse and reflect a similar pattern of grievances. There are records, books, news articles, or television programs that document the abuses of the group/leader. Followers feel they can never be 'good enough'. The group/leader is always right. The group/leader is the exclusive means of knowing 'truth' or receiving validation, no other process of discovery is really acceptable or credible.  Now lets go through these one by one.  'Absolute authoritarianism without meaningful accountability.'  Now it is difficult for Molyneux to engage in as authoritarian practises as the FDR cult isn't under one roof. However Molyneux defiantly doesn't support any meaningful diversity of opinion or forgiveness of past actions which went against the message of the cult, I don't think this covers but it is close.  'No tolerance for questions or critical inquiry.'  Any questions posed to Molyneux are quickly censored [1].  'No meaningful financial disclosure regarding budget, expenses such as an independently audited financial statement.'  If Molyneux has ever published a budget I am yet to find it.  'Unreasonable fear about the outside world, such as impending catastrophe, evil conspiracies and persecutions.'  Lets say that if anything counts it's this [2] in this video Molyneux claims that all his followers should remove themselves from relations and friends who are not adherents to the non aggression principle (which I accept) because all non adherents will want to kill you.  'There is no legitimate reason to leave, former followers are always wrong in leaving, negative or even evil.'  I can't find anything on this.  'Former members often relate the same stories of abuse and reflect a similar pattern of grievances.'  If my opponent denies this I suggest he look in the comments section of this debate otherwise here is a forum of ex FDR members discussing their experiences [3].  'There are records, books, news articles, or television programs that document the abuses of the group/leader.'  Here are some [4] [5].  'The group/leader is always right.'  Other than a few inconsequentially's Molyneux more or less claims constant and unquestionable integrity [6].</t>

<h>Resolved: That Global Warming is not significantly affected by humans I thank the opponent for the debate challenge. As the opponent has not defined any terms, the definition of the terms shall go as follows: Global Warming: Noun The unequivocal rise of the global average temperature; also attributed to the unpredictable climate in the world. [1] Significantly: Adverb In a sufficiently great or important way as to be worthy of attention. [2] Humans: Noun Mankind, homo-sapiens,  Affected: Adjective  Influenced or touched by an external factor. [2]   Since this debate resolution is a normative resolution, the Burden of Proof is shared. For the opponent to win, he has to prove that humans have almost no responsibility in causing global warming.   With this said, the introduction and the proof that global warming exists shall be shared first, as this debate cannot go on with the assumption that it exists, as assumptions are inherently detrimental.    Axiom One: Global Warming Necessarily Exists   Global warming is no longer a possibility, but it is indeed a necessity. There has been an increase of 0.8 degrees Celsius in the last 100 years, with 0.7 degrees Celsius of this increase happening in the last 30 years [3]. From 1880, the temperature of the world was recorded via NASA meteorological stations; this data proved vital in identifying a change in temperature. From 1980 upwards, one can see a very high increase in the mean temperature of the world; the running average of global temperature from 1980 has increased by almost 100%.    This graph, compiled by NASA GISS from data provided by many sources, confirms that Global Warming necessarily exists, as can be seen via the sharp increase of the running average from 1980.   Global Warming exists; there is no doubt. Then what causes Global Warming? It is us, humans, that cause Global Warming.   Proposition One: Carbon Dioxide Release from Multiple Sources    Global warming has been allegedly caused by an excess of Co2 release from the ocean and multiple other sources. Accordingly in 2000, 29.5% of Co2 emissions came from power stations, 20.6% from Industrial Inputs/Outputs, 11.3% from residences and 9.1% from land use/biomass. [4] In 2008, 8.37 billion tons of Co2 was released from multiple of human based sources. However, one might object; “what’s wrong with the increase in release of Co2?”  of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide – act as a thermal blanket for the Earth, absorbing heat and warming the surface to a life-supporting average of 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius).' /gt;  Quite simply this; the sun emits ultraviolet radiation and light into the earth as energy. The earth absorbs and the re-emits some of this energy as infrared radiation back. However, greenhouse gases on the atmosphere absorb this temperature and releases it in arbitrary directions; henceforth, the earth is 33 degrees warmer than what it should have been, causing life to exist on this planet. However, this 33 degrees Celsius is the equilibrium; for it to go lower would be positive feedback, as the equilibrium could easily be restored in a short period of time, but for it to go higher would make this positive feedback and would threaten to turn our planet into a “Venus” like planet (not suitable for life). This positive feedback is more dangerous than the negative feedback, for it requires intense study of the origins of the causes. [5][6]   The causes of this release are the anthropocentric human lifestyle. To support our life, we humans have taken means to extract resources from mother nation in a Machiavellian manner. Humans are egoistic, hence the development of Capitalism and the government. From the following graph, we can see a correlation; from 1980, Co2 release sprouted and so did gas production.      If oil production is increasing, then clearly oil is also in demand; the burning of 4 liters of oil creates a shocking 8 kg of Co2. [7] 73 million kg of Co2 is henceforth released by the increase consumption of oil/diesel fuels; with these increases of Co2 emissions from fuel burning and usage alone, we can see that there is no reason to believe that humans are not causing this increase in Co2 emissions.    This graph also shows how the Industrial Revolution, in around 1840, has caused the dramatic rise of Co2 concentration. The Industrial Revolution was the basis of all industries; it revolutionized many industries and increased outputs via machinery. However, the Industrial Revolution had its basis on coal and electricity. Apart from natural gases, coal is also a huge factor in Co2 release. The usage of anthracite coal releases 920g of Co2 per kW/h, whilst the usage of lignite coal releases 990g of Co2 per kW/h. Coal is burnt for one reason only; to supply us with the electricity that runs this computer, this website, and this world. In South Africa, for example, 74% of all Co2 emissions is caused by coal burning; it would be doubtful that if humans were present, this figure would not be present. [8] As stated via the first graph of this proposition’s defense, the correlation between oil production and Co2 released is further supported by the fact that burning fuels for human usage causes the increase in the release of Co2.  Proposition Two: Deforestation  This second proposition is based upon two fundamental premises. 1. Trees absorb Co2 and release oxygen 2. Forest Fires increases Co2 release The first of these two premises is based upon the fact that trees absorb Co2 and release oxygen. This process is called photosynthesis; trees, for so long, have sustained our life through this process.     A single tree can absorb 21kg of Carbon Dioxide! That is enough to absorb the burning of 12 liters of oil! “Only if there were more trees” one would say. [9] The existence of trees means that excess Co2 could be processed and could possibly be eradicated in large amounts. However, deforestation has created a very sad and woeful dilemma for us; we are releasing more Co2 than eve, and yet we are cutting down the mechanisms that fate gave us to counter this Co2 release. It is estimated that 20% of all Co2 in the atmosphere right now would have been absorbed and would be non-existent if it weren’t for massive deforestation. [10]    The second of these premises are based upon the mere process of global warming; the warmer the temperature, the more likelihood of fires turning from small fires to huge fires. Forest fires are one of the most feared disasters in the world. Forest fires, apart from killing a plethora of citizens, can release as much Co2 as cars do. A study was released that demonstrates that in these United States of America, 290 million tones of Co2 was released due to forest fires, which is 4-6% of the entirety of Co2 released during that year. [11] Humans, due to their anthropocentric interests, have caused forest fires to appear more often due to the reckless burning of grass, wood, and other resources can cause forest fires. There is also a considerable amount of cases where forest fires started with someone carelessly dropping a cigarette on the forest grounds.    This evidence shows that humans are highly responsible for the creation of global warming; we are deferring how we absorb Co2 as well as releasing more of it. This is significant in such a manner that this issue cannot be ignored. Our planet will become Venus in the following years if this issued is not cared too.    The resolution is therefore negated. </h>

    <t>'I would like to thank the opponent for his short response.' My opponent points out that my response was significantly shorter in an attempt to make it seem weaker. Length of the response has nothing to do with the quality of it. It's not about the amount of words in your argument, it's about the amount of argument in your words. The main reason why my opponent had such a large argument is because he decided to explain the entire process of global warming, which was completely unnecessary.  In my opponent's second paragraph, he addresses the fact that we 'should've' had an ice age, but we didn't. In this way, my opponent's attempts to debunk my claims. I do not see the point of the paragraph. It is evident from the graph that I provided that cool-downs and peaks do not occur on a perfect 100,000 year schedule, and there are variations, plus or minus 10,000-15,000 years. My opponent also says that 'we are heading towards another Ice Age in the opponent's view'. My argument never centered around Ice Ages. Yes, I believe we are heading towards an Ice Age that will only occur in several more millenniums, but that is not my argument. My argument is that global warming is a naturally occurring process which humans have little to no control over. My opponent must have the graph wrong, because the last ice age occurred less that 50,000 years ago. If so, how in the world was there supposed to be an ice age in the 1950s?  Next, my opponent addresses the CO2 concentrations and shows a little cloud diagram. Although humans pump tons of CO2 into the atmosphere, global temperatures are not changing proportionally. According to my opponent's diagram, volcanic CO2 emissions reach up to 319 million tonnes per year, while human-burned fossil fuels produce 29 billion tonnes a year. That means that humans put out at least 90 times more CO2 into the air than nature does. If we are the cause of global warming, then logically, global temperatures would increase by an enormous factor. But do they? The graph that I provided clearly shows that there has not been any earth-shattering increase in temperature as there should have been when humans are increasing the amount of CO2 from its natural levels by a factor of 90.  The rest of my opponent's argument is also different facts about how much CO2 humans are putting into the atmosphere. I will note that my opponent pays no attention to temperature itself, but only focuses on the changes in CO2 amounts. We are not arguing about CO2, we are arguing global warming, which is the change in temperature, not CO2 concentration. As I proved in the above paragraph, global temperature is not changing proportionally to the amount of CO2 increase, meaning that although there may be a correlation, it is not strong enough to base your entire argument on it.  It so happens that CO2 is not the number 1 greenhouse gas. Water vapor is. Water vapor accounts for up to 70% of the greenhouse effect. Water vapor is everywhere and when its amount increases, so does the global temperature. While CO2 also plays a role, it is minuscule compared to water vapor and humans have no effect on the amounts of water vapor in the atmosphere. This debunks my opponent's entire argument.  Something else that I would like to note is that most/all the graphs my opponent uses are using information about the last 100-200 years. Of course, on those graphs the temperature is actively increasing with CO2 because of how 'zoomed in' they are. If you look on a broader scale (the graph that I provided), it is obvious that CO2 levels cycle just like global temperature, and my opponent simply zoomed in on the peak, so it seems like it is forever increasing.  I will now recap my points and show that humans have little to no impact on global warming.  1. Even though CO2 concentrations have increased by a factor of 90, the temperature has not increased anywhere near that amount, suggesting that there is not such a strong relationship between CO2 and global temperatures. While CO2 does make a difference, the correlation and effect is not strong enough to make any conclusions and base entire arguments on it.  2. The cycle of global warming followed by ice age, followed by another global warming has been going on for hundreds of thousands of years, and we currently reaching the peak of temperature. Humans have little to no impact on this naturally occurring process.  3. CO2 is not the 'biggest' greenhouse gas, water vapor is. Meaning that with an already weak correlation between CO2 and temperature, CO2's impact was just proven even smaller because it is not the only nor most effective greenhouse gas. Water vapor accounts for up to 70% of the greenhouse effect, meaning CO2 accounts for less than 30% of it (because there are many other greenhouse gases such as methane).  As a result of these three main points, I believe it is reasonable to conclude that humans have no significant impact on global temperatures.  Thank you for the good argument.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank the opponent for his short response. Now, in debunking the opponent’s case, we have to observe one thing; accordingly to the Industrial Revolution/Co2 release correlation graph, we can see that the Co2 release has gone outside the main tenants of the normal Co2 equilibrium, which accordingly is around (when effected by negative feedback) 200ppmv. However, we humans now have a ppmv-Co2 rate of 380ppmv, henceforth this may be an offspring, but very unlikely, of huge negative feedback, or it may be the beginning of huge positive feedback in the creation of a new Venus-like Equilibrium.  The opponent mentions the 100,000 years Ice Age Cycle phenomenon; henceforth, we are heading towards another “Ice Age” in the opponent’s view. Firstly, the world’s orbit-tilt, which causes the earth’s temperature to change (as well as volcanoes), are not acting as strong as they were during the last Ice Age. This means that the current Interglacial might be extended by 10,000 years. Apart from this, the plethora of Greenhouse Release, from Co2 and other gasses, outweigh the cooling capacity of the world. If they weren’t, then the world would have been experiencing a period of cool-down, perhaps a mini-Ice Age, from the 1950s. However, as seen, this has not been the case. [1] Apart from this, the opponent’s graph seems to show that in each 100,000 year Ice Age cycles; there has been a natural release of Co2 that has caused a gradual change in temperature. However, scientists know about how this change of temperature came about already. Interglacial epochs were characterized by the balance of Co2 concentration in the air and the Co2 sink in the ocean. There have been occasional times of massive Co2 release rise from volcanic eruptions known as large igneous provinces. These large igneous provinces have been known to cause a sudden change in temperature; however, there are no large igneous provinces that are active. Apart from this, one must observe the fact that today’s volcano does not emit as much Co2 as humans.   In fact, accordingly to the USGS, annually humans generate 130 times more Co2 gas than volcanoes. The opponent is implying that there are natural causes for Co2 and other greenhouse gas release in the world; however, there is a plethora of evidence that suggests the contrary. This data has already been presented. Apart from this, correlation is not causation; because the current Co2 rates in the atmosphere correlates with those of ancient times (which it does not, as already stated), does not mean that this rapid release of Co2 has not been caused by humans. The opponent must observe; there is a difference between gradual change and sudden change. Gradual change implies that the change is made clear gradually. Sudden change is built upon the common knowledge that this change is sudden and unexpected. If this were to have been gradual change, then we humans would have knew about this much later; however, that is not the case.  The opponent seems to argue that this change is normal for the earth; however, we must see that before 1750, Co2 was at a rate of 20ppm in the atmosphere; however, this Co2 rate rose rapidly from 1750, after the industrialization of human capital output capabilities. Now it is at 379ppm, an 18 times increase from the pre-1750 rate. Fossil fuel usage has released 7.2 gigaton of Co2 in 2000-2005. (gigaton-1 billion metric tons). One cannot simply argue that humans do not play a massive role; we are messing with the earth’s ability to absorb Co2 via deforestation, as well as adding 42% more Co2 into the earth’s atmosphere within the last 300 years. Humans have, in a significant manner, effected the overall global temperature.</t>

    <t>You have a good argument, and it is truly disgusting what humans are doing to this Earth, BUT they are not the cause of global warming, as I will argue.  My opponent spends most of his argument explaining the process of global warming, which I find unnecessary, but at least now all the voters know exactly what's going on.  Now, my opponent mentions the greenhouse gases (CO2 in this case) and that with humans, their concentration increases, therefore causing global warming. While humans do, in fact, increase the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere (as my opponent proved), this does not significantly impact the process of global warming. (I request that the voters take a look at this as well)  These graphs clearly show that even hundreds of thousands of years ago, when humans were not pumping CO2 into the atmosphere, the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere and atmospheric temperatures regularly cycled. They peaked about every 100,000 years before dropping back to a minimum. This correlation shows that even without the effect of humans, global warming is a natural process that occurs about every 100,000 years before subsiding once again.  It is evident that humans do not significantly affect the process of global warming and it is only a big deal right now because we are reaching a peak (as shown on the graphs).  I await my opponent's response.</t>

<h>4R1NRC: On Ice Ages The opponent misinterprets my argument. I have stated that hypothetically, if this were a natural cycle, then the natural cycle would have started the cooling process since 1950; however, this is not the case. Without human involvement, a decline in solar activity and increase surge of volcanic activity should have led to the decrease of earth’s temperature.  The causes of Ice Ages are not fully understood, but the scientific community has agreed on two fundamental facts; one is that greenhouse gases are causing an increase in temperature. This has in turn caused a huge melt in ice in the North and South poles; as stated, this ice loss, accordingly to the theoretical ice age predictions, should have been reversed.  The second fundamental fact that the scientific community has agreed upon is that the dinosaur release of methane was at a correct level for the world to be at a warm environment, or at least an environment worth of life. However, this methane rates are at such low rates when compared to current rates that it would be almost impossible for us to reach an Ice Age in millenniums.  Theory in this case does not correlate with actuality; theory states that humans should be experiencing a decrease in temperature, and increase in Polar Ice Levels. We are experiencing the opposite of that. As the earth’s temperature has been increasing for the last 30 years, and the Polar Ice levels are decreasing, one must understand that this change is not natural. This change can be enacted only via humans, and humans alone caused this. One must understand that for one to reach an interglacial like ours, one would need to go back 430,000 years. Our interglacial interval, called the Holocene, has been in existence for 17,000 years, yet it is experiencing conditions of interglacial periods which have been in existence for 30,000 years. Without significant human involvement, this would have been impossible. 4R2NRC: On Co2 and its effects Before we start dissecting this argument, note that the resolution here is “humans significantly affect global warming” not “humans are the cause of global warming” Although both propositions are true, and is not normally debated; the complete defense of the first proposition is enough for the opponent’s BoP to not be fulfilled. With this in mind, it can be said that Co2 causes a lot of global warming.    Fig One Take this graph for example; this graph shows the amount of Co2 present in the atmosphere, when compared with other greenhouse gasses (excluding water vapor, which shall be touched upon in my next argument). The x-axis shows the radiance, or the amount of radiation that is emitted into the surface. As we can see, the radiance of Co2 is incredibly high in radiance when compared with Carbon Oxide and Dinitrogen Monoxide. Co2 can trap an incredibly high amount of heat and emit it in all directions, more so than many other greenhouse gasses.  With this said, the high increases in Co2 will cause an increase in temperature. Apart from this, the opponent seems to object the 100% increase in the running average of temperature. From 1882, the running average is at about -0.6 degrees Celsius. In the early 2000s, that figure is at 8 degrees Celsius; during the early 1980s, this figure skyrocketed. This is due to the increase consumption of fossil fuels and many other substances, like coal, which has created a huge impact on the temperature of the earth.   This graph demonstrates the sources of human Co2 in the world; albeit one may say that us adding 29 billion g/T to the Carbon Cycle does not affect the Carbon Cycle significantly, this previous proposition can be proven false as the Carbon Cycle is only designed to absorb certain amounts of Co2 and apart from that, humans are destroying the main apparatus of Co2 absorption, which is, naturally, trees! The opponent here accuses me of talking purely about Co2, and not climate change. However, Co2 is the main cause of climate change, as proven by the above graph provided in this contention. Co2, as demonstrated in R1, is one of the most fatal gasses and could cause a huge increase of temperature. Henceforth, the increased in release of Co2 would have caused the huge increase in temperature that humans are experiencing in the last 30 years. Apart from this, one cannot simply state that historically, there has been more Co2 lurking in the atmosphere, because currently we have the most atmospheric Co2 in 800,000 years. If this is not enough, then the opponent would be satisfied in knowing that humans also release an excessive quantity of methane; albeit methane does not linger as long as Co2, its short term effects on the environment are devastating. In a measure of effectiveness in terms of trapping heat, methane traps 120 times more heat than Co2. Methane causes 25% of the current global warming crisis.   The above pie graph shows the sources of methane; as one can see, only 29% of methane releases are from natural causes. Is this not enough evidence to show that humans effectively have a significant effect on global warming? (btw cow fart also release methane) 4R3NRC: On Water Vapor Fig One shows us the radiance of several greenhouse gases excluding water vapor. Why is this? Because indeed, water vapor is the most evident greenhouse gas in the air, with twice as much concentration of water vapor in the air than Co2. Is water vapor the main cause of this crisis? Before we answer that question, two objections must be raised. “It is better safe than sorry” is a classic statement of the old. It is very illogical; perhaps even a non-sequitur, to say that water vapor is the main cause of global warming, so we should release as much Co2 as possible. As stated and demonstrated, Co2 can cause huge climate change within the area of release. Our second objection is this; if water vapor is the cause of global warming, then why are temperatures rapidly rising now? A slow increase can be understood, but a sudden increase cannot. For scientists have such an advanced knowledge that the study of geological structures (of rocks, fossils et all) can prove, quite accurately, the temperatures of the world at stages in history; with this knowledge, theoretical predictions about the earth should be satisfied. However, they are not. This cannot be because of nature, but because of anthropological causes.  With this stated, we must dissect this water vapor case. To assume that Co2 cannot have a significant effect on global warming is illogical; all greenhouse gasses cause global warming. If water vapor is the cause of global warming, then for one degrees Co2 causes to warm the planet, water vapor would cause another degree of this same temperature to rise. However, this is not the case, as Water Vapor causes one degrees Celsius of this warming, whilst Co2 causes three. Apart from this, although water vapor is the most powerful greenhouse gas, its lifetime is relatively short lived; unlike carbon, the earth’s atmosphere allows water vapor to return as substance form in the form of rain. This is done so due to the water cycle; however, the warming caused by Co2 also affects the water cycle, as the warmer the planet gets, the more water vapor is evaporated into the sky, causing a change in temperature and climate throughout the world. In conclusion, Co2 release, methane release, failures in Ice Age prophecies and the increase in release of water vapor due to the increase in anthropogenic Co2 release causes global warming. Because of these reasons, the resolution is negated. Sources: All used from last round</h>

    <t>'Since 2000, CO2 has risen by 54% with no increase in global temperatures'?Putting aside that ten years is only three percent of our three-century discussion, the decade from 2000-2010 actually experienced the highest average temperature anomaly of any decade since before 1900. [5]This is why the fifth IPCC report's 'Summary for Policy Makers'[7] boldly stated that 'each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth’s surface than any preceding decade since 1850,' and could also be why CON provides no source for his claim that the years 2000 through 2010 have 'experienced no increase in global temperatures.'Hans Von Storch told the House of Representatives in 2006 that 'Based on the scientific evidence, I am convinced that we are facing anthropogenic climate change brought about by the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.'[8] CON has attempted to represent Hans Van Storch as follows:'As described in [8], Von Storch systematically ran all the IPCC computer models of the climate, and found that the actual temperatures for the last 17 years fell outside the model predictions.'Von Storch is not an author of CON's eighth source. The source has fifteen authors, but none are named Von Storch.These fifteen authors summarize their own work as follows: 'We demonstrate that considerable ambiguity exists in the choice of parameters, and present and compare three alternatively tuned, yet plausible configurations of the climate model. The impacts of parameter tuning on climate sensitivity was less than anticipated.' At no point do they imply that 'the actual temperatures for the last seventeen years fell outside model predictions.' Sunspot activity should affect climate, and if we examine the blue shades of the following 'climate change anomalies' chart [7], we see sunspots match the evidence provided by CON in relation to both sunspots and Pacific Decadal Oscillation, with the dip in temperatures at or near the center of the 20th century.[5]The blue shading represents models that only account for 'natural forcings' such as Solar Sunspot Activity and Pacific Decadal Oscillation. The pink shading represents models that account for 'both natural and anthropogenic forcings.' This chart demonstrates the sharp contrast in these competing models, showing that sunspots and other natural forcings should provide a near-flat average global temperature (with curves similar to CON's first round 3 image in North America, Europe, and Africa) while anthropogenic forcings should show a sharp rise. Observations are given by the black lines, and appear to agree more with the 'anthropogenic amp; natural' models than with the 'natural' models alone. It appears that anthropogenic forcings have sharper relevance than sunspots.Con narrates his round 2 and my round 3 as follows:'I pointed to reconstructions of climate for the distant past and the for the past 2000 years to show that climate has varied more than in recent years, and without any apparent relation to atmospheric CO2 levels. Pro argues that past climate doesn't count because we are only discussing the past century and the next century.'It would be a drastic mistake to argue that 'past climate doesn't count,' and I thank CON for bringing this potential misunderstanding to my attention.I argued that 'The Nature article quoted by Con demonstrates that solar insulation changed the Earth's climate more in 2,000 years than the human race has in 250 years.' That is to say, the rate at which solar insulation changed the Earth's climate was more than (250 / 2000 = 0.125 ) 12.5% of our current rate of Climate change. Consistent change matters more to larger time frames, rate of change matters more to smaller time frames. This is not because the laws of physics change, in fact this is demonstrable in physics and mathematics. Because force = mass * acceleration, a constant net force of one Newton can accelerate a 1,000 kilogram car to 299,792,458 meters per second (speed of light) in 83 hours, 12 minutes [299,792,458 ms^2 / (1,000 kg * 60 s * 60 min) = 83.2 hr], but in the first hour will only bring the speed of the car to 3.6 meters per second [(60 s * 60 m) / 1,000 kg), or just over eight miles an hour. The longer the time measurement, the more relevant the 'rate of change' or the 'rate of rate of change' or the 'value of the exponent,' while the shorter the timespan, the more relevant the 'application of force' or the 'constant' or the 'variable' or the 'coefficient.' The laws of physics and mathematics all but guarantee that the dominant force of climate change in a 300 year timespan is different from the dominant force of climate change in a 100,000,000 year timespan.The last 50 years of climate anomalies demonstrate that the next 200 years of climate anomalies will be dominantly anthropogenic,[5]while CON's arguments are founded on a combination of 1) the last 600 million years of climate change and 2) the specific decade of 2000-2010. Does he somehow mean that solar, volcanic, botanic, and other natural factors will accelerate their rate of influence by 100,000 times over for the first time in over 600,000,000 years? CO2 follows temperature increase in ice sheets with a lag of a few hundred years when assessing a timespan of 20,000 years, which is why CON's fifteenth source numbers its X-axis in units of 1000 years before 1950.[CON-15. http://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com...;]The CO2 level of an ice sheet is measured by the CO2 level, while the temperature of the ice sheet is measured by the deuterium level. Scientists aren't sure exactly how long it takes for deuterium differences to show up in ice caps, which is why CON's fifteenth source states 'Our analyses of ice cores from the ice sheet in Antarctica shows that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere follows the rise in Antarctic temperatures very closely and is staggered by a few hundred years at most,' rather than asserting that they have reversed the Greenhouse Effect. Their overall point is that the two measurements correllate. The 2013 IPCC report states that 'Climate change models have improved since the AR4. Models reproduce observed continental-scale surface temperature patterns and trends over many decades, including the more rapid warming since the mid-20th century and the cooling immediately following large volcanic eruptions (very high confidence).'[7] I think we can all agree that Michael Mann was wrong ten years ago, and that the graph of climate anomalies is not shaped like a hockey stick, especially since that's not the topic of the debate I instigated, of the points I have argued, or of the sources I have cited.'Total Sea Ice is at a High'?Which is more relevant to 'total sea ice' - area, or volume? CON made an argument about area, I made arguments about 1) volume and 2) temperature. Melting the ice caps reduces the volume, but the ice flows down and refreezes, which both warms the temperature and expands the area. Temperature is more closely linked to this debate than volume OR area. It has nothing to do with Al Gore, and the PDO is a mere blip on climate anomaly grids.'Future CO2 levels are unknown'?'Once they heat to a certain point, the oceans are expected to start releasing CO2 back into the atmosphere, which may include massive reserves that have been down there for millions of years.' - Me, round 1, CON has yet to respond.A technological breakthrough will not allow sunspots to catch up with Anthropogenic Climate Change before 2200. It will take them tens of thousands or even millions of years.'Most aspects of climate change will persist for many centuries even if emissions of CO2 are stopped. This represents a substantial multi-century climate change commitment created by past, present and future emissions of CO2.'</t>

    <t>CO2 has increased by 54% in past 17 years with no global warming, and CO2 theory cannot explain whyNASA data, which I cited in [6], shows there has been no global warming for 17 years. Here is the graph from [6]:Pro argued that the average temperature for each decade has increased for each of the last three decades. That does not contract the fact of there being no global warming for 17 years. Suppose the temperature anomalies were scaled to be 1 in 1980, 2 in 1990, 3 in 2000, and 3 in 2010. Then the decade averages would be 1.5, 2.5, and 3 respectively, with a higher decade average despite no increase in the 2000s. The post-2010 data, which Pro did not consider, also shows no temperature increase. Temperatures rose sharply in the 1990s, so the average for the decade is about half way between the low at the start of the decade and the high at the end. There is no increase from the end of the 90s to the present, so saying the average for 2001 through 2010 is higher than the 90s only says that 90s were warmer at the end of the decade than the beginning. My primary reference for the claim that that IPCC models cannot explain the 17 year lack of global warming is Tinsdale's book “Climate Models Fail” [7]. Tinsdale provides a book length comparison of IPCC model results showing that what actually happened in climate was outside of the error band of model predictions.Tinsdale correctly references Von Storch, but I provided the wrong link, for which I apologize. The Von Storch paper cited by Tinsdale is online, but it can only be accessed with academia.edu membership. Storch says “we find that the continued stagnation in global warming, from 1998 to 2012, is inconsistent with model predictions, even at the 2% confidence level.” Tinsdale also referenced the Mauritsen paper, which I linked in [7]. Like Von Storch, it shows that no reasonable tweak in the IPCC models can bring then into agreement with what actually happened. If CO2 dominated climate in the 20th century, then temperature should have risen monotonically through the century. If fact, there was a sharp decline at the beginning of the century and long gradual decline from about the 40s through the 60s. The general trend is upwards, but a general upward trend is what we would expect if sunspots dominated climate. I presented the sunspot graph previously, but here is a nicer rendition.  Temperature is closely following sunspot activity, but not CO2, through 2000 The continuation, below, shows the pause in global warming post-2000 is consistent with the sunspot cycle having peaked. The 17 year pause in global warming is causing great consternation among scientists who previously believed CO2 predominated. A news report by Voosen summarizes the widespread recognition among scientists that the models are not working, and that some major factors are missing, although among CO2 advocates, there is no agreement among CO2 theorists as to what is wrong. Pro's [5] shows that natural forcing of climate is only a minor part of the model predictions. However, Pro's figure shows is that the model predictions are completely wrong. Temperature was supposed to rise sharply after 2000, as the figure shows, but it did not. Models proved wrong cannot be relied upon for future predictions. As Voosen documents, in the IPCC models, sunspots are only modeled as having a direct irradiance effect, and that effect is negligible for the 20th century through the present. Something else is happening that gives sunspots a much greater influence on climate. Total sea ice is at a high Pro's initial contention was that vanishing Arctic sea ice proves that CO2 dominates climate. That's wrong on two counts. Correlation does not prove causation. Also, global warming is global, so it cannot be that Arctic ice measures warming but Antarctic ice does not. In the last round, Pro changed his position and argued that total ice is important and not sea ice. But total ice has been decreasing since the early 1800s, well before any claim of anthropogenic warming. Total ice shrinking doesn't say anything about the cause. Pro claimed that melting land ice in Antarctica caused the increase in sea ice. That's impossible, because 99.9% of Antarctica has never gotten warm enough for ice to melt. There is a tiny peninsula that goes far enough north to occasionally have some melting, but that's negligible. Future CO2 levels are unknown Pro speculates that once there is any warming from anthropogenic CO2 it will take 10,000 years or even millions of years to correct. Pro agrees that warming causes the release of CO2 from the oceans. That does not address the issue of what future CO2 levels will be. It only says that if there is warming from some cause, that the CO2 levels in the atmosphere would be higher, after some delay, than if CO2 were not released from the ocean. We know it is not the case that warming causes a runaway of temperature due to the release of CO2 causing further warming. The data by Rasmussen [15] shows that CO2 goes up and down following temperature with a lag of a few hundred years, and that is true when either temperatures or CO2 levels are higher than present. It cannot matter whether there was one degree of warming due to sunspots or due to anthropogenic CO2, if any warming were to cause a CO2 induced runaway of temperature, it would have shown up in the temperature and CO2 variation of the past 250,000 years, and it has not happened. All of the IPCC models assume that CO2 levels in the atmosphere are dominated by a continuing exponential rise in anthropogenic CO2. But fossils fuels are unquestionable being exhausted, so it is impossible for CO2 levels from burning fossil fuels to continue to rise exponentially. The only question is when anthropogenic CO2 will fall below the assumed exponential increase. Prof. David Archibald, an expert on fossil fuel reserves claims, “At best, we might get to about 600 ppm ...” [21. p.91] As fossil fuels become scarce the price will rise, which will lead to the use of alternatives like nuclear power, which is present only marginally more expensive than fossil fuels. But let's suppose that the 600 ppm level is reached at the end of the century. That's a 56% increase in CO2. But the 54% increase in CO2 in the past 17 years produced no net increase in global temperature. Because scientists agree CO2 warming is logarithmic, the same percentage increase should produce the same amount of warming. The CO2 warming of the past 17 years was canceled by natural phenomena not in the climate models, so Pro's claim that the climate problem is solved is false. Is 600 ppm total CO2 is the correct number? I don't, and no one knows for sure. The upper limits and the future rates of CO2 production are major unknowns that make it impossible for Pro to meet his burden of proof.Climate prediction based upon solar activity The IPCC model projections of climate depend upon the CO2 effect on warming being multiliplied by a positive factor of two or more by secondary effects, such as the warming increasing water vapor in the atmosphere. Archibald [21. p 1] summarizes: The real world evidence says the opposite. In late 2007, Dr. Roy Spencer of the University of Alabama published a paper analyzing data from the Aqua satellite. Based on the response of tropical clouds, Dr. Spencer demonstrated that the feedback is negative. He calculates a 0.5°C warming for a doubling of the pre-industrial carbon dioxide level. Global warming, as caused by carbon dioxide, is real but it is also minuscule, and will be lost in the noise of the climate system.</t>

    <t>Correlation plus a theory is not proof CO2 dominates climateMy opponent noted temperature generally rising since 1900 and CO2 rising since 1900, and claims that because CO2 is a greenhouse gas, it must be responsible for the rise. The error in that logic is that we do not know how much of the rise is due to CO2 and how much is due to other factors affecting climate. We could plot increasing consumption of charcoal in backyard barbecues, noted that burning charcoal heats the atmosphere, and then concluded that barbecuing causes global warming. The barbecue theory is defeated by showing that there isn't enough heat generated by the volume of charcoal consumed to have a significant warming effect. Similarly, Pro offers no analysis that shows CO2 to be even a significant cause. Pro has the burden to prove not only that CO2 dominated climate in the last century, but that it will dominate the next century despite all unknown factors affecting climate. Here is a reconstruction of CO2 and climate over the past 650 million years. Over geological time, clearly climate has been dominated by factors other than CO2. On the geological time scale, we are currently in an unusual period of low temperatures and low CO2. It a very complicated picture, proving that climate is far more than just CO2. Pro shows the CO2 data for the past 650,000 years.Temperature follows the same pattern, only CO2 follows temperature. If the graphs are time aligned, the result is not that CO2 causes warming. Quite the opposite, CO2 rises about 800 years after temperature rises. Warming causes CO2 because warmer oceans cannot dissolve as much CO2. In 2013 the prestigious journal Nature published an up to date scientific reconstruction of climate for the past 2050 years. It shows that over the period climate varied by about as much as the present warming, with both the Roman Period and the Medieval Warm Period warmer. It remains possible that CO2 is contributing significantly to current warming, but the natural variations are so large that CO2 might be inconsequential. Current climate science has no explanation for the major climate variations of the past 2000 years. That's why the discredited global warming hockey stick attempted to prove there were no past variations. Pro has the burden to prove CO2 dominates. I say it's unlikely CO2 dominates, but no one really knows. Total sea ice is at record levels and CO2 can't explain whyPro argues that arctic ice is melting, that proves CO2 is the cause. Historically, Arctic ice melts when Antarctic ice increases in a cycle of 40 to 60 years called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The PDO pattern fits the cooling period from the 40s to the 70s that CO2 cannot explain. The Arctic was last clear around 1940. Global warming alarmist scientists warned that this time the Antarctic was melting as well, and they made the confident prediction in 2010 was that the Antarctic would be ice free by 2013. What actually happened is that the Antarctic reached record high levels of ice:  “The Antarctic surge is so big that overall, although Arctic ice has decreased, the frozen area around both poles is one million square kilometres more than the long-term average.” If CO2 warming dominates climate, it cannot be that it is overwhelmed by other factors like the PDO. But it is.CO2 theory cannot explain the pause in warming To accurately predict future climate, computer models must be proved to be reliable. We know the models did not predict ice formation in the Antarctic nor pre-1900 climate variations. In addition, global warming has essentially ceased since 1997, so a check on the accuracy of climate models is how well this pause is predicted.  Sscientists predicting CO2 crisis use many variations of computer models. The collections are called CMIP3 and CMIP5, with CMIP5 the very latest. ... Climate models cannot simulate past surface temperatures, precipitation or sea ice area. Those are basic components of Earth’s climate. … The concern about the latest slowdown in warming was addressed by a recent scientific study by Von Storch, et al. (2013) “ Can Climate Models Explain the Recent Stagnation in Global Warming? ” The one-word answer to the title question of their paper is, “No”. They stated: However, for the 15-year trend interval corresponding to the latest observation period 1998-2012, only 2% of the 62 CMIP5 and less than 1% of the 189 CMIP3 trend computations are as low as or lower than the observed trend. Applying the standard 5% statistical critical value, we conclude that the model projections are inconsistent with the recent observed global warming over the period 1998- 2012.  [7. Tisdale, Bob (2013-09-23). Climate Models Fail (Kindle Locations 276-291)] The Von Storch paper is available free in draft format. There are a number of ocean oscillations in addition to the PDO. These are not accurately modelled in the computer simulations and likely account for the rapid warming before the current pause. The Medieval Warm Period and the following Little Ice Age correlate extremely well with sunspot activity, but no physical cause of the warming and cooling has been definitively linked to sunspots so there is nothing in the computer models representing the effects. It is not direct change in the solar radiation, because that varies too little to explain the large effect. Danish scientist Svensmark has proposed that changes in cosmic rays linked to variations in sunspots affect cloud cover by a cloud seeding mechanism, but CO2 scientists discount that, so nothing is in the computer models. All of the climate change in the past century could be accounted for by less than a 3% change in cloud cover, but even with satellites cloud cover measurement is difficult. The cloud height is important as well as the density.We don't know future CO2 levels Everyone, crisis advocates and skeptics alike, agrees that whatever the CO2 sensitivity it is logarithmic. So if doubling CO2 produces a one degree rise, which is about the theoretical rise if there is nothing in the climate that magnifies the effect, then doubling it again would produce another degree of warming. An exponential rise in CO2 produces a linear rise in temperature. If we had a perfect model of CO2 effects on climate, we would still need to know how much CO2 is left to be produced and at what rate. Everyone agrees oil and coal are running out, but no one is sure how fast. But as supplies get scarce, prices rise and alternatives become economically viable. A technological breakthrough like a cheap, efficient battery would drop carbon consumption dramatically. It's another major unknown.A clarification of the resolution was agreed to in the debate comments so Pro must show that CO2 dominates climate in the past and future century. Pro has not made a convincing case that CO2 accounts for past climate change, nor that either computer models or carbon consumption assumptions are reliable enough to predict the future. He has the burden of proof.</t>

    <t>Since 2000, CO2 has risen by 54% with no increase in global temperatures. Why? Pro cannot provide a good answer to that question, and neither can the IPCC. The theory that CO2 dominates climate is therefore wrong. It may be that CO2 is contributing to warming at some level, but that a greater cooling factor is swamping the CO2 effect. If that's the case, there is no basis for supposing that CO2 will dominate climate in the future, because whatever cooling dominated the past 17 years may be the same or greater in the future. The IPCC cannot explain why a 54% increase in CO2 produced no increase in temperature. As described in [8], Von Storch systematically ran all the IPCC computer models of the climate, and found that the actual temperatures for the last 17 years fell outside the model predictions. That's after the models had been tweaked using knowledge of the lack of global warming. The models still could not describe the past, so clearly they cannot be counted on to predict the future. Pro only offers at base the fallacious logic that correlation means causation. But when CO2 increases by 54% in the past 17 years, and there is no increase in global temperature, then even the correlation claim fails.  Solar activity correlates well with global temperature for the past 17 years, for the entire 20the century and for as long as records of sunspot activity have been kept, which is back through the Middle Ages. Solar activity is discounted by CO2 theorists on the grounds that the measured irradiance of the sun, i.e.. the heat output, has not changed enough in recent decades to account for the temperature changes. However, solar activity produces changes in cosmic ray levels, and there is a theory that cosmic rays have an effect that changes cloud cover. The solar cosmic ray theory is also one of correlation, and cannot be considered causation until the mechanism is proved. However, unlike CO2 theory, the correlation actually holds over long and short periods. There is a close correlation of solar sunspot activity and global temperature for the past century. The past 17 years has been at the leveling off and start of a downward trend in sunspots after a period of increase during the 1980s and 1990s. Historical reconstruction shows CO2 does not dominate climate I pointed to reconstructions of climate for the distant past and the for the past 2000 years to show that climate has varied more than in recent years, and without any apparent relation to atmospheric CO2 levels. Pro argues that past climate doesn't count because we are only discussing the past century and the next century. Past climate counts because the laws of physics do not change at all over time. Consequently, if factors other than CO2 have always dominated climate, then it's unreasonable to suppose that a new CO2-only physics began recently. Pro's principle argument is that correlation proves causation. If there was no such correlation in the past, that is not sustained. Since the chance correlation only applies for a short time, it's important to Pro's case that we not look at the hundreds, thousands, and millions of years when there was no such correlation.Here are the two climate reconstructions referenced in the previous round:The climate of the past 2000 years shows there is nothing special about the past century. Climate has always been changing by about as much as in the past century, and often more.  Global warming hockey stick discredited The global warming hockey stick was presented in the 2000 IPCC report. It purported to show that the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age were local to Europe and that climate had not changed substantially in the past 1000 years, until the warming from 1983-1997. The statistical error used in the calculation yielding the hockey stick was discovered by McKitrick. [12. 'The Mann et al Northern Hemisphere 'Hockey Stick': A Tale of Due Diligence.' published in 'Shattered Consensus' edited by Patrick Michaels]. A good summary by a scientist who believes in human-caused global warming is from the MIT magazine Technology Review. The Wikipedia article, heavily biased towards CO2 theory claims that the hockey stick has since been proved because a recent analysis shows that recent temperatures were higher than the Medieval Warm Period. However, the accompanying graph shows that the MWP and the Little Ice Age existed as worldwide climate change, which is what the hockey stick was mainly supposed to disprove. The most recent reconstruction [3] clearly disproves the hockey stick. CO2 follows temperature increase That CO2 lags temperature in past climate is well known, but I apologize for giving the wrong link in the previous round. A journal article published in 2012 gives the result: “Our analyses of ice cores from the ice sheet in Antarctica shows that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere follows the rise in Antarctic temperatures very closely and is staggered by a few hundred years at most,” - Sune Olander Rasmussen [15. Watt provides graphs and links the Rasmussen paper. Another set of graphs showing the lag is given at. Total sea ice is at a highPro argued that shrinking Arctic ice proved that CO2 causes global warming. I pointed out that Antarctic ice is expanding, contradicting CO2 theory, and in keeping with the historically observed Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Pro responded that the ice doesn't melt until above the freezing point. Sure, but how was melting Arctic ice supposed to prove CO2 theory? The Antarctic ice has rapidly expanded since 2010, when Al Gore predicted it would be all gone by 2013. What this proves is that CO2 is not dominating climate. The natural PDO, not in the CO2 climate models is dominating the ice levels. The PDO seems to be linked to the second of three overlapping solar cycles, but the causation is unproved. Future CO2 levels are unknown I noted that even if CO2 dominates climate, there is no confident prediction of future CO2 levels. Nearly everyone agrees that the world is running out of fossil fuels, so there is an aggressive search for alternatives. A technological breakthrough, or a simple substantial rise in the price of oil could substantially lower the rate of CO2 increase. Pro did not respond.</t>

    <t>My opponent claims that the 'climate competitors' of CO2 account for an unknown portion of temperature anomaly. We actually have a comprehensive understanding of both chemical and physical factors of climate change. He is correct that if we compared a chart of barbecue emissions with a chart of atmospheric heating, it would be absurd to assume barbecuing causes global warming.However, if we measured the effects of shortwave radiation, longwave radiation, the manner in which each passes through clouds, the effects of vegetation, the net greenhouse effects of the oceans, and emissions of non-barbecuing greenhouse gases, we would be in a much better position to say whether barbecue emissions cause global warming. [5] Con correctly argues that the barbecue theory would be defeated by showing that the volume of charcoal is insufficient. So back to the discussion, what's the volume of CO2 output? The United States alone has a crude oil energy output of 19,420,000,000,000,000 British Thermal Units [6]. Is this comparable to backyard barbecues?[5]The fifth report by the International Panel of Climate Change [7] claims that 'Human influence on the climate system is clear. This is evident from the increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, positive radiative forcing, observed warming, and understanding of the climate system.' It presents evidence that the CO2 output of fossil fuels and anthropogenic land usage together total are nearly three times higher than the CO2 output of rock weathering, volcanic activity, total respiration of life forms, forest fires and freshwater outgassing combined. [5]Con offers a reconstruction of the last 650,000,000 years, but this is a discussion about the years 1900 to 2200. Geological time is slow enough to be irrelevant in the 3-century blip we are discussing. In this context, hundreds of millions of years is simply beyond a defensible scale. CO2 levels are not higher than what they were 100,000,000 years ago before the existence of humans, but they are higher than they have been in 400,000 years. 'Current climate science has no explanation for the major climate variations of the past 2,000 years.' I have BOP for my claims about modern climate observations, but Con needs to provide a source for this claim.'That's why the discredited global warming hockey stick attempted to prove there were no past variations.' Source and specifics would be appreciated.Con claims that CO2 follows temperature rather than causing temperature, claiming the graphs are in a link. I would appreciate if Con could import these graphs into DBO and reference them as individual images, as I am unable to find an image that matches this description in the link provided.The Nature article quoted by Con demonstrates that solar insulation changed the Earth's climate more in 2,000 years than the human race has in 250 years. It does not suggest that the factors it discusses could compete with the human race during industrial and post-industrial ages. Again, this is a discussion about a 300 year timespan.[5]'Historically, Arctic ice melts when Antarctic ice increases in a cycle of 40 to 60 years called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO).' The Pacific Decadal Oscillation has no relation to the absorption of energy by the oceans from the years 1970 to 2010, which have shown a strong increase in net energy both in the liquid oceans and in the polar ice caps.“The Antarctic surge is so big that overall, although Arctic ice has decreased, the frozen area around both poles is one million square kilometres more than the long-term average.” Both Arctic and Antarctic temperatures are supposed to be far below freezing, and neither will commence a serious level of shrinking until they reach the melting temperature of water. As the top of the ice caps melt, the water runs down and is cooled by the ice below, slightly reducing or maintaining the total mass of the ice while possibly increasing the total area. However, it also increases the average temperatures of the Antarctic and Arctic.</t>

    <t>I thank my opposition for accepting this debate.This discussion is about Climate Change Anomalies from the years 1900 to 2200 (see comments section), and whether they are anthropogenic. Anomalies are deviations from 'schedule' weather cycles, and can include both hot and cold extremes, making 'global warming' only half of this discussion.So, right off the bat, temperature anomalies began rising just after the year 1900 [1].Y = temperature anomaly, range = 1.25C. As shown in the following chart [2], this corresponds closely with a recent rise in CO2 emissions. This chart shows that CO2 levels have always travelled in cycles, but broke their most recent scheduled downward cycle to reach their highest level in over 400,000 years. In a sense, one might say nature did half the work on CO2 and the human race took it from there.Y = CO1, range = 220 ppm, min = 180, max = 400. Correllation is obviously not causation, but the mechanics that link CO2 to temperature have been well documented.Atmospheric Greenhouse Effects: A Review [3]CO2 does not deflect visible light, which is what originally makes it to the earth's surface. Upon reaching the earth's surface, visible light is partially absorbed by the earth or water, and partially reflected. The reflection process lowers its energy level, turning it into infrared light. CO2 deflects infrared light. So CO2's reflective properties for the earth are one-directional. Visible light pass downward unperturbed, but upward infrared is deflected downwards / sideways. This effectually increases the amount of light striking the surface of the planet, which at current greenhouse levels protects life from the freezing cold of space, and at future levels threatens to roast life - not to death, but to ecological disequilibrium.  Oceanic Greenhouse Effects: A ReviewThe oceans currently absorb atmospheric CO2 and are undergoing a resulting drop in pH. They are also currently absorbing most of the extra heat from the sun, and therefore are experiencing a rise in temperature. Once they heat to a certain point, the oceans are expected to start releasing CO2 back into the atmosphere, which may include massive reserves that have been down there for millions of years. However, before the oceans can truly begin warming, the ice caps have to melt. And as we can see here [4], though the ice caps have shown about a half-century lag behind the thinner, more responsive atmosphere, they are roughly 1 million square kilometers smaller than they ought to be, as of 2014.It appears that climate anomalies are closely associated with CO2 levels, that CO2 levels are primarily anthropogenic and will continue to be so until the next 'natural' CO2 spike roughly one hundred thousand years from now (chart 1), and that the greenhouse mechanisms behind all this are straightforward and established.</t>

<h>There has been no global warming for 17 years, despite a 54% increase in CO2 Pro now argues there is something wrong with NASA's Remote Sensing Satellite (RSS) data [6] because it does not measure temperature with a thermometer. No scientist, to my knowledge, has ever questioned the ability of RSS to measure temperature. Satellite measurements are far superior to the spotty coverage of weather stations subject to urban heat island effects. Satellites provide global coverage at much higher densities than attainable with in situ observations. In situ observations also suffer from non-uniform temporal coverage and undocumented changes in the instrumentation used that can lead to local biases and increased uncertainty. … Satellites can measure the temperature of the atmosphere by evaluating thermal emission from gases in the atmosphere. ... By choosing the different measurement frequencies, and thus different values of absorptivity, the emission from different layers of the atmosphere can be measured. RSS studies the measurements made by 3 series of satellite-borne microwave sounders in order to construct long-term, climate-quality atmospheric temperature datasets for use by the scientific community.  [24. http://www.remss.com...] If temperature continued to climb in the past 17 years, we would expect advocates of the theory of CO2 dominated climate to trumpet the success of climate models. But those advocates recognize the fact that the models have failed, the Voosen article I cited makes it clear that CO2 advocates are struggling for an explanation of why the models have failed. I explained in detail why there is no inconsistency with having no temperature increase in 17 years and having the 2001-2010 decade averaging warmer than the 90s. Pro ignored my explanation and claimed that there is a conflict. Pro said I claimed that the temperature anomaly was reset for each decade. That's nonsense, I made no such claim, and if it were reset every decade then the temperature anomalies would be a string of zeros. The anomaly is an arbitrary offset to prevent graphs from having to be scaled with the average global temperature of around 59 degrees F or 287 degrees Kelvin. Pro's graph shows global warming to have stopped since 2000. In additional to providing the actual data and the opinions of scientists who advocate CO2-dominated climate, I provided the work of Von Storch and separately of Mauritsen who showed that CO2 models could not explain the pause. [7] Pro claims I misrepresented Von Storch because in 2006 Von Storch said he believed CO2 dominates climate, but in 2012 Von Storch admitted the CO2 models failed. I quoted Von Storch as saying “we find that the continued stagnation in global warming, from 1998 to 2012, is inconsistent with model predictions, even at the 2% confidence level.” [17] That's not a misrepresentation. Scientists become convinced by unrelenting contrary data. The same is true of other CO2 advocates, quoted by Voosen [20], who finally have given up trying to defend the models. I cited Tinsdale's book [7] for it's extensive comparisons showing the CO2 models fail. Pro argues that I needed to have shown and argued every piece of evidence in the book. No, all I needed to do was to make a claim and cite the evidence. To refute Tinsdale, Pro might have cited some contrary compendium showing all the models were on target, but there is no such evidence to be cited. Some of the CO2 advocates claim the lack of global warming is due to something other than cosmic ray clouds seeding. Hansen supposes it might be reflective soot from coal burning in China. For the present debate, it suffices to say that CO2 is not dominating climate, and so until the science is resolved future predictions cannot be made reliability under the assumption that CO2 dominates. Cosmic ray effects, or something else associated with sunspots, are clearly the most likely factor because the sunspot trend since the early 1800s has been generally in favor of warming, but sunspots activity also tracks the Medieval Warm Period, the Little Ice Age, the global warming pause from the 40s through the 70s, the 70s sharp cooling, and the current 17 year lack of global warming. All this was shown clearly in the data presented in the debate.Current models do not include all the natural forcings  Pro's graphs of temperature with and without CO2 are purely math model predictions. He says that they include sunspot and ocean oscillation effects, but they unquestionably do not. That's apparent because the real temperatures post 2000 did not rise as the graphs show, and also because the projections go out into the future. Voosen [20] specifically referenced these elements missing from the models. The “natural forcings” in the model projections are defective because they do not include the cosmic ray and magnetic effects of sunspots, rather only the inconsequential changes in irradiance. Pro began by arguing that that we should not look at temperatures before 1900, because that's when anthropogenic global warming began. However, the physics of climate do not change, and temperature reconstructions on scales of millions of years, hundreds of thousands of years, and the past 2000 years show that CO2 has never dominated climate, no matter what the source of CO2. CO2 levels have been many times current levels. In the past, CO2 increase was a product of warming, not a cause. CO2 may increase warming slightly, but it's never prevented natural forcings from driving temperatures down. To show that CO2 now dominates climate, advocates must show that no other natural factors are significant, but current lack of warming shows that the models are dead wrong. In this round Pro introduced the argument that CO2-induced warming began in the 1800s. But then what caused the preceding Medieval Warm Period and Little Age? It's far more likely that whatever caused those major climate changes ended, producing the subsequent warming. Those major climate events were tightly correlated with sunspot activity. To argue it was CO2, a switch must have been flipped around 1825 causing sunspots to no longer have an effect and CO2 to start dominating. Polar sea ice has increased to a current high, contrary to CO2 theoryPro began by claiming that the decrease in Arctic Ice proved that CO2 causes global warming. That claim evaporated in the light of evidence that Arctic ice has been disappearing and reappearing for centuries with the cycle of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which is not in the CO2 climate models. Also, CO2 warming does not explain why Antarctic ice has increased so much so that total ice has had a net increase. Pro shifted to arguing that total accumulated ice on earth has been decreasing since the end of the Little Age, but that is better explained by sunspot activity than CO2. No one claims the Little Age was due to a sudden CO2 shortage.Future CO2 levels are unpredictable. Pro offered only unsupported assertions to counter cited expert opinion that we are rapidly running out of fossil fuels, and technology will provide substitutes. The sun, not CO2, dominates climate  We are seeing the real world destroy the theory of CO2 dominating climate. The CO2 math models cannot be tuned to explain how a 54% increase in CO2 has failed to produce and increase in global temperatures. For a while, the notion was that the failure was some transient glitch that would quickly disappear. After 17 years, it's clear that there is a fundamental lack of understanding reflected in climate models. CO2 theorists have been fervent in clinging to their theory, but they are nonetheless still scientists and ultimately obliged to yield their theory to the contrary data. I'm sure that science will ultimately succeed in getting climate models that match reality, and that the models will include some effect of CO2. But it should not be a surprise that the sun dominates climate, even though we are still figuring out exactly how.</h>

However, the physics of climate do not change, and temperature reconstructions on scales of millions of years, hundreds of thousands of years, and the past 2000 years show that CO2 has never dominated climate, no matter what the source of CO2. CO2 levels have been many times current levels. In the past, CO2 increase was a product of warming, not a cause. CO2 may increase warming slightly, but it's never prevented natural forcings from driving temperatures down. To show that CO2 now dominates climate, advocates must show that no other natural factors are significant, but current lack of warming shows that the models are dead wrong. In this round Pro introduced the argument that CO2-induced warming began in the 1800s. But then what caused the preceding Medieval Warm Period and Little Age? It's far more likely that whatever caused those major climate changes ended, producing the subsequent warming. Those major climate events were tightly correlated with sunspot activity. To argue it was CO2, a switch must have been flipped around 1825 causing sunspots to no longer have an effect and CO2 to start dominating. Polar sea ice has increased to a current high, contrary to CO2 theoryPro began by claiming that the decrease in Arctic Ice proved that CO2 causes global warming. That claim evaporated in the light of evidence that Arctic ice has been disappearing and reappearing for centuries with the cycle of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which is not in the CO2 climate models. Also, CO2 warming does not explain why Antarctic ice has increased so much so that total ice has had a net increase. Pro shifted to arguing that total accumulated ice on earth has been decreasing since the end of the Little Age, but that is better explained by sunspot activity than CO2. No one claims the Little Age was due to a sudden CO2 shortage.Future CO2 levels are unpredictable. Pro offered only unsupported assertions to counter cited expert opinion that we are rapidly running out of fossil fuels, and technology will provide substitutes. The sun, not CO2, dominates climate  We are seeing the real world destroy the theory of CO2 dominating climate. The CO2 math models cannot be tuned to explain how a 54% increase in CO2 has failed to produce and increase in global temperatures. For a while, the notion was that the failure was some transient glitch that would quickly disappear. After 17 years, it's clear that there is a fundamental lack of understanding reflected in climate models. CO2 theorists have been fervent in clinging to their theory, but they are nonetheless still scientists and ultimately obliged to yield their theory to the contrary data. I'm sure that science will ultimately succeed in getting climate models that match reality, and that the models will include some effect of CO2. But it should not be a surprise that the sun dominates climate, even though we are still figuring out exactly how.</t>

    <t>'NASA data, which I cited in [6], shows there has been no global warming for 17 years.'So how do we have two competing sources for what should be the same information?PRO [5] - IPCCCON [6] - NASA?If we look closely, CON's [6] doesn't actually reference NASA, it references wattsupwiththat.com. The wattsupwiththat article uses RSS data, not NASA data. RSS, or Remote Sensing Systems, does not measure temperatures using a thermometer, it takes readings of microwaves, as explained on its homepage. The data demonstrates that microwaves are not 'net heating' the earth, but CON and the wattsupwiththat article argue that the earth itself is not being warmed. When measured by thermometers throughout the globe, IPCC and NASA sources have shown that the earth clearly is being warmed.CON's [6] is a particularly ironic source in the context of this debate, during which CON has advocated sunspots as an alternative temperature explanation to CO2.CON argues that 'decadal average' means that the meaning of 'anomaly' is reset every decade. The IPCC actually addressed this concern by setting every decadal average relative to the same constant (in this case, 'Anomalies are relative to the mean of 1961−1990.'[7]). 'My primary reference for the claim that that IPCC models cannot explain the 17 year lack of global warming is Tinsdale's book “Climate Models Fail” [7].' - CONThe existence of a book title is not an argued debate point. If CON has read Tisdale's book, he should be able to explain and present what he learned in this debate. Otherwise, I should be having this debate with Bob Tisdale.'Tinsdale provides a book length comparison of IPCC model results showing that what actually happened in climate was outside of the error band of model predictions.' - CONWhich model predictions do CON and Tisdale speak of? Because when the IPCC compared model predictions to observations, the temperature observations were outside the 'natural forcings' band of model predictions, and well withing the 'natural and anthropogenic forcings' band of model predictions. This was part of what I presented in round 4. 'Tinsdale also referenced the Mauritsen paper, which I linked in [7]' - CONCON [7] references Tinsdale, not Mauritsen.'Temperature was supposed to rise sharply after 2000, as the figure shows, but it did not. Models proved wrong cannot be relied upon for future predictions.'Perhaps CON missed this: the blue shading is the natural, absence-of-man prediction; the pink shading is the natural + anthropogenic predictions; and the black line is the reading taken by the thermometers. The black line is consistent with the blue shading for the antarctic region, seems indecisive for the Southern Ocean, and correllates with the pink shading for the Arctic, North America, Europe, Asia, the North Pacific, the North Atlantic, Africa, the South Pacific, South America, the South Atlantic, the Indian Ocean, Australia, and Antarctica. 'Pro's initial contention was that vanishing Arctic sea ice proves that CO2 dominates climate.' - CONPRO's initial contention was actually that temperature anomalies correspond to a rise in CO2 as predicted by the greenhouse effect, and demonstrated by sea ice temperature, sea ice mass, climate temperature, ocean temperature, and ocean PH.'Correlation does not prove causation.' - CONPRO 20th century physics consisted of bombarding particles into each other and measuring the deviation of their paths. This was well-tested far beyond being a correlation argument, to the point that physicists predict photonic behavior with laser precision (literally). It is by this mechanism that greenhouse theory exists. It's not a correlation argument, it mathematically calculates that visible photons have no trouble passing through the earth's atmosphere to warm the surface, but upon bouncing back upwards and losing energy (increasing wavelength), are prone to be deflected back at the earth by greenhouse gases. This re-warms the earth. 'Global warming is global, so it cannot be that Arctic ice measures warming but Antarctic ice does not.' - CONThey both measure warming, but remember - it's global, so we cannot use Antarctic ice to ignore temperature observations from the Arctic, North America, Europe, Asia, the North Pacific, the North Atlantic, Africa, the South Pacific, South America, the South Atlantic, the Indian Ocean, Australia, and - yes - even the temperature readings of the Antarctic (as I pointed out in round 3, ice and temperature cannot have a linear relationship except at temperatures near freezing point - this is why 'absorption of energy' is more relevant than short term temperature).'In the last round, Pro changed his position and argued that total ice is important and not sea ice' - CONI argued that deuterium levels from the last ten thousand years were less relevant than energy readings from the last century. CON's narrative of my position is unrecognizable to me, so my most objective route at this point is to request of voters that they actually find the 'PRO' arguments that correlate with the 'CON' narrative before either agreeing or disagreeing with it - and vice versa.'total ice has been decreasing since the early 1800s, well before any claim of anthropogenic warming.' - CONDeforestation has actually increased net CO2 emissions since before 1750 but in negotiating this debate, CON chose 'temperature anomalies from 1900 to 2200 are / will be predominantly anthropogenic' from a number of other possible Anthropogenic Climate Change Exists subtopics, so we'll have to save that discussion for another day. As I have explained at least three times in this debate, ice represents two out of seven continents to measure, and as CON has explained, this is a discussion about global temperature.'Pro claimed that melting land ice in Antarctica caused the increase in sea ice.' - CONI discussed three measurements - temperature, volume, and area. These were ALL in regards to land ice in Antarctica. PRO Round 3:Both Arctic and Antarctic temperatures are supposed to be far below freezing, and neither will commence a serious level of shrinking until they reach the melting temperature of water. As the top of the ice caps melt, the water runs down and is cooled by the ice below, slightly reducing or maintaining the total mass of the ice while possibly increasing the total area. However, it also increases the average temperatures of the Antarctic and Arctic. 'Future CO2 levels are unknown' - CONSolar, volcanic, botanic, and other alleged hidden variables in century-measured climate change would have to accelerate hundreds of times over in the next two centuries if anthropogenic CO2 is to become a 'secondary' driver of climate anomalies. This can even be deduced from CON's use of geological data, which covers up to 600 million years at a time.Current physical predictions indicate that anthropogenic global warming will be steady and lingering for several centuries, and statistically comprehensive climate data corresponds to this theory.9.</t>

    <t>The instigator has set the rules of the debate. I thank him for that. Please allow me to recapitulate.  'Pro may use their first round, but not round 5. Pro has BoP. Pro has to prove the topic right. I will argue (as con) that global warming does not exist.'  The topic is 'Global Warming Exists.'  Since this, so formulated, is totally open-ended I will state some definitions. It is open-ended because 'Global warming' is left undefined. Left the way it is, I only need show that the Earth has had a hotter year than a previous year to show that 'global warming exists.' Thus the debate would end here. I do not believe that was the intention of the instigator even if he framed the debate this way. However, since the term 'Anthropogenic' is not included, I will not include it here. I only need show that 'Global Warming' (see below) exists now, and NOT that is a consequence of making's action under the rules of this debate.  I would like to address one issue up front, this is the issue of intellectual authority.  Authority au'thor'i'ty [uh-thawr-i-tee, uh-thor-] noun, plural au'thor'i'ties. [1-4] redacted 5.an accepted source of information, advice, etc.  We will reference the definition (5) here. 'An accepted source of information' In the 21st Century, it is recognized that science and technology have reached a stage where educational specialization is necessary for technical disciplines. No longer can just anyone hang up a shingle and practice medicine. Now, a degree from an accredited university is necessary. In addition, we recognize that people with medical degrees, have an intellectual authority in the field of medicine. This means specifically, their opinion in the matters of medicine carry more weight than the opinions of those who have not obtained the same degree. Climate Science is also such field. The conclusion here is that people with advanced degrees in Climate Sciences have more authority in when discussing 'Global Warming' than does the non-climate scientist.  'Climate change skeptics regularly denounce me as a disgrace to journalism for declining to accept their dogma, which is mostly received wisdom from sources that I'd trust to evaluate the published science about as much as I'd trust a plumber to perform open heart surgery. Nothing against plumbers, mind you. They're just not heart surgeons. And the economists, statisticians and agenda-driven politicians routinely cited by the skeptics aren't glaciologists, botanists, biologists, oceanographers, atmospheric physicists or computer modelling specialists.' -James Hoggan  For a working definition of 'Global Warming,' I suggest we use 'Global warming is the unequivocal and continuing rise in the average temperature of Earth's climate system.'  Climate VS Weather The discussion here is about climate vs weather. I have included a video to show the difference. Since It is hard to add to the arguments in this video, I'll allow it to stand on its own. This debate is about CLIMATE not Weather.  Global Warming Introduction  We are in the midst of a warning trend. Various fluctuations happen, in climate, over time, However, the current warming trend is of particular significance because most of it is very likely human-induced and proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented in the past 1,300 years (see) IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, Summary for Policymakers, p. 5 ' B.D.

Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost 150 to 250 cubic kilometers (36 to 60 cubic miles) of ice per year between 2002 and 2006, while Antarctica lost about 152 cubic kilometers (36 cubic miles) of ice between 2002 and 2005.-Levitus, et al, 'Global ocean heat content 1955'2008 in light of recently revealed instrumentation problems,' Geophys.

Subjective Realities - English speaking Nations James Powell searched the Web of Science for peer-reviewed scientific articles published between 1 January 1991 and 12 November 2012 that had the keyword phrases 'global warming' or 'global climate change.' The search produced 13,950 articles.By Mr. Powell's definition 24 of the 13,950 articles, 0.17% or 1 in 581, clearly reject human-caused global warming or endorse a cause other than CO2 emissions for observed warming. The articles have a total of 33,690 individual authors (rounded to 33,700 in the figure). The 24 rejecting papers have a total of 34 authors, about 1 in 1,000.  What we MINIMALLY see here is there were 13,950 and 580 out of every 581 peer-reviewed scientific articles were about AGW or AGW effects, mitigation, adaptation, methods of detecting, climate modeling, and paleoclimatology. Since AGW is dependent of 'Global Warming' a priori, we deduce those papers endorse the idea of global warming.  Here is Mr. Powell's interpretation of his study: 'When a new scientific theory is first proposed, scientists often go out of their way to state explicitly that they reject it, or that they accept it. This was the case with continental drift in the 1920s, with plate tectonics in the 1960s, and with the Alvarez theory of dinosaur extinction in the 1980s. One reading the literature in these fields can usually tell from the title of an article alone whether an author rejects the new theory. But after a theory achieves maturity and becomes the ruling paradigm, scientists no longer see any point in stating explicitly that they accept the now-no-longer-new theory. They take it as a given, often as an observational fact'like the measured movement of tectonic plates and the measured global temperature rise. To explicitly endorse the ruling theory would have the counter-effect of suggesting that the theory is in doubt. It is obvious that global warming has achieved the status of the ruling paradigm of climate science. Thus it is reasonable to assume that publishing scientists who today reject human-caused global warming would make it clear that they do so, while publishing scientists who accept the theory would not feel the need to say so explicitly. As a practical matter, virtually all of the global warming papers that Oreskes and I separately reviewed can be classified as about effects, mitigation, adaptation, methods of detecting, climate modeling, and paleoclimatology. Authors of these papers would hardly be likely to deny the existence of the very thing they are writing about. It is theoretically possible that a paper on paleoclimatology could be the exception, dealing with the lack of evidence for CO2-driven global warming in the geologic past, say, leading the author to question the seriousness of modern, human-caused global warming. I did not find such papers. What we know for a fact is that among the authors of peer-reviewed articles, only a tiny fraction, which I estimate as about 1 author in 1,000, rejects human-caused global warming. In my opinion, based on my understanding of the history of science, it is reasonable to conclude that nearly all publishing climate scientists accept that human activities are causing the Earth to warm. Polls of scientists reinforce this conclusion, but polls are no substitute for the primary, peer-reviewed literature, the ground truth of science. 'The International Community (All of the world is NOT the United States) Science and global warming affects all of us. Global Warming is not a US ONLY issue, yet climate change denial, to a very large extent is. It is at least almost limited to the English speaking world with over 80% of it being in the US. The issue of 'global warming' is not a political controversy in most countries. How is that possible is Global Warming is not really happening?</t>

    <t>I will start by thanking the CON side for their response.  One does not 'declare' facts. CON's arguments are false memes without substance.  1. No Global Warming CON: 'There hasn't been any global warming since 1997.' (DECLARATION) There is no substantiation for this claim. it is patently false. It also shows the CON side either did not look at the video or did not understand it.  CON: 'It also begs an obvious question: How can we be experiencing global warming if there's no actual 'global warming?' The CON side 'declared' a meme, 'there is no global warming' and asks a rhetorical question based on the false meme.  2. No Scientific Consensus CON:'There is no scientific consensus that global warming is occurring and caused by man' (DECLARATION) Again a declared meme, and false. I have shown that of all peer reviewed articles written the last thirty years over 99.7% of them concurred that global warming is happening. Simply stating there is no consensus means nothing.  The only argument presented against consensus is a propaganda document called 'The OISM Petition.' Almost everything about this supposed propaganda document is suspect. CON references this here:  CON: ' Over 31,000 scientists have signed on to a petition saying humans aren't causing global warming.'  Now to sign on to this document one has to state one was a 'scientist.' That includes Medical Doctors, Materials Engineers, etc. While these are certainly complex fields, being a Medical Doctor does not give one special insights into Climate Science. On top of this, the number of scientists are inflated for propaganda effect.  This document is very much like '100 authors against Einstein,' a document, signed by two real 'scientists' and a number of others. Einstein's response was telling, 'if Relativity was False, 1 author would be quite enough.' 'At this point it's literally impossible to know because the names and degrees on the (above) list cannot be verified by anyone outside the OISM. We can only take the OISM's word that they're all real names, that all the degrees are correct, and so on. This does not stand up to the most basic tests of scientific credibility.' ...  'Ultimately, The OISM petition will continue to rear it's ugly head until its fabricated credibility has been thoroughly demolished. Social conservatives and libertarians, each of which has their own ideological reasons to push the OISM petition, have been effective at keeping the '30,000 scientists reject warming chicken-littleism of IPCC' meme circulating throughout conservative media outlets, even as climate disruption-focused media have worked at limiting the damage from the OISM petition. But given the fact that the science supporting a dominantly anthropogenic cause for climate disruption is overwhelming, it's only a matter of time before the OISM petition wilts in the heat.'  There is a worse part here. This is a propaganda document propagated by propaganda sites on the Internet.  More than this, the CON misses that even this validates the PRO side.  CON writes: ' Over 31,000 [unverified] scientists have signed on to a petition saying humans aren't causing global warming.'  But these same people make no claim that Global Warming is NOT happening. They say humans aren't causing GW. Now the fact that they address that humans are not CAUSE of the problem implies that they recognize that the problem exists.  'Scientific consensus is the collective judgment, position, and opinion of the community of scientists in a particular field of study. Consensus implies general agreement, though not necessarily unanimity.  Consensus is normally achieved through communication at conferences, the publication process, replication and peer review.' 3. Arctic Ice misconception Again, a short term trend presented as Climate science. This example almost invalidates CONs entire argument as it shows two extreme problems with CON's reasoning. The first is that he only addresses arctic ice 'EXTENT' not its MASS which is a much more significant measurement. 'Just to clarify, not only is the Arctic sea ice extent decreasing, but just as critical, the mean thickness of the Arctic sea ice pack also has precipitously decreased. In fact, although not quite an ice extent minimum record year, by February, this year was already a minimum record year for the amount of thick multiyear ice present in the pack. '  Secondly he falls into the trap which was displayed in the Degrasse video above. Citing a statistic over six months shows a marked lack of understanding of the basic science involved.  3. James Hansen's 'Prediction' 'James Hansen made his statement in response to a question by Bob Reiss, a journalist and author, in 1988. He did not predict that the West Side Highway would be underwater in 20 years.  Bob Reiss reports the conversation as:  'When I interviewed James Hansen I asked him to speculate on what the view outside his office window could look like in 40 years with doubled CO2. I'd been trying to think of a way to discuss the greenhouse effect in a way that would make sense to average readers. I wasn't asking for hard scientific studies. It wasn't an academic interview. It was a discussion with a kind and thoughtful man who answered the question. You can find the descriptio''n in two of my books, most recently The Coming Storm.'  James Hansen reports the conversation as follows: 'Reiss asked me to speculate on changes that might happen in New York City in 40 years assuming CO2 doubled in amount.'  SO the quote used is out of context and DOES NOT says what CON purports it to say. Again, this calls serious question into CON's selection of data sources and ability to validate data.  USE OF SUSPECT DATA SOURCES. One of the most disturbing parts of CON's arguments is his reliance on Propaganda sites for information. Data on the internet is highly suspect and requires a measure of data validation. It is easy to find 'evidence' for almost anything on the Internet. It is not easy to find AUTHORITATIVE information on the Internet. To give an Hypothetical example, it is as if we had been debating the Israeli-Palestians conflict and CON only referenced HAMAS websites. 'Spencer is a signatory to An Evangelical Declaration on Global Warming, which states that 'Earth and its ecosystems ' created by GOD'S INTELLIGENT DESIGN AND INFINITE POWER AND SUSTAINED BY HIS FAITHFUL PROVIDENCE ' are robust, resilient, self-regulating, and self-correcting''  This is HARDLY a SCIENTIFIC authority. Invoking 'intelligent Design' (Myth) is mixing Religion with 'science' and hardly lends credibility to the Dr. Spencer's authority. I suspect, as do most others, that Dr. Spencer's reliance on ancient superstitions has more to do with his work than does the science.  'In 2011, Spencer and Braswell published a paper in Remote Sensing concluding that more energy is radiated back to space and released earlier than previously thought. Spencer stated, 'The satellite observations suggest there is much more energy lost to space during and after warming than the climate models show. There is a huge discrepancy between the data and the forecasts that is especially big over the oceans.'  The paper was criticized by mainstream climate scientists.Kerry Emanuel of MIT, said this work was cautious and limited mostly to pointing out problems with forecasting heat feedback.  The editor-in-chief of Remote Sensing, Wolfgang Wagner, later resigned over publication of Spencer and Braswell (2011),stating, 'From a purely formal point of view, there were no errors with the review process. [...] the problem I see with the paper by Spencer and Braswell is not that it declared a minority view ...but that IT ESSENTIALLY IGNORED THE SCIENTIFIC ARGUMENTS OF ITS OPPONENTS. This latter point was missed in the review process, explaining why I perceive this paper to be fundamentally flawed and therefore wrongly accepted by the journal.' Wagner added he, 'would also like to PERSONALLY PROTEST AGAINST HOW THE AUTHORS AND LIKE-MINDED CLIMATE SCEPTICS HAVE MUCH EXAGGERATED THE PAPER'S CONCLUSIONS IN PUBLIC STATEMENTS'  Continuing to the GlobalResearch Link, this is NOT a reputable organization.  This site is set up and run by Michel Chossudovsky, The Western Standard included Chossudovsky on the list of 'Canada's nuttiest professors, those whose absurdity stands head and shoulders above their colleagues'; criticizing Chussodovsky's thesis and views ' that the U.S. had knowledge of the September 11 attacks before they happened; that Washington had weapons that could influence climate change; and lastly, that the large banking institutions are the cause of the collapse of smaller economies ' as 'wild-eyed conspiracy theories'. Such as Washington's New World Order Weapons Can Trigger Climate Change' - Michel Chossudovsky  Here is a GlobalResearch Link about the 9/11 conspiracy. As I look over CON's arguments, there is no attempt, at all, to validate the authority of the statements presented. Global warming has been shown and there has yet to have been a single verifiable argument lodged against it here.</t>

Pro still does not fulfill BoP, even if my arguments are declared false or broken apart, this does not immediately make them fulfill BoP, which they still have yet to do.  2. I have more scientific evidence that my opponent did not address.  3. A group of 15 scientists and meteorologists have put forward a scathing rebuttal to the Obama administration's recent climate report which said the U.S. is already being harmed by global warming. Scientists skeptical that mankind is causing the Earth's climate to change say that such claims are based on false theories and flawed models. The White House report is a 'masterpiece of marketing' that is trying to scare people into action, scientists said. 'As independent scientists, we know that apparent evidence of 'Climate Change,' however scary, is not proof of anything,' wrote the 15 scientists and meteorologists,including Dr. Don Easterbrook of Western Washington University and Dr. George Wolff, who formerly chaired the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee. 'Science derives its objectivity from robust logic and honest evidence repeatedly tested by all knowledgeable scientists, not just those paid to support the administration's version of 'Global Warming,' 'Climate Change,' 'Climate Disruption,' or whatever their marketing specialists call it today,' they continued. The White House's 'National Climate Assessment' (NCA), released last week, claimed that the U.S. was already being affected by global warming though warmer temperatures and increasing extreme weather events. But the 15 skeptical scientists said the White House is trying to lay the blame for global warming at the feet of the fossil fuels industry when there is little evidence to back up that claim. The Earth's climate is very cyclical and has gone through many changes in the past, the scientists said, without humans emitting carbon dioxide. 'This NCA is so grossly flawed it should play no role in U.S. Energy Policy Analyses and CO2 regulatory processes,' the skeptics wrote. 'As this rebuttal makes clear, the NCA provides no scientific basis whatsoever for regulating CO2 emissions.' 'We are asked to believe that humans are drastically changing the earth's climate by burning fossil fuels,' they added. 'The problem with their theory is very simple: It is NOT true.' The NCA says the U.S. average temperature has risen between 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit to 1.9 degrees Fahrenheit since 1895, which is causing more extreme weather, like hurricanes and droughts, and harming fragile ecosystems around the country. The NCA also warns that the U.S. average temperature could rise 4 degrees Fahrenheit in the coming decades if nothing is done to limit carbon dioxide emissions. The report suggests a slew of regulatory solutions from cap-and-trade to green energy subsidies to mitigate global warming. ''Global Warming' has not been global and has not set regional records where warming has occurred,' the skeptical scientists rebutted. 'For example, over the last fifty years, while the Arctic has warmed, the tropical oceans had a flat trend and the Antarctic cooled slightly.'[1]  I had more info that pro did not address, that had many scientists behind them. 4. As the Obama administration and Senate Democrats feverishly stoke up hellfire and brimstone global warming alarm to promote a Climate Action Plan, leading voices in green choir robes have abandoned the climate crisis hymnal.  Dr. Patrick Moore, a co-founder of Greenpeace, quit the activist environmental organization in 1986 after it strayed away from objective science and took a sharp turn to the political left.  Testifying on Feb. 25 before the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee's Subcommittee on Oversight, he took issue with the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) claim that 'Since the mid-20th century it is 'extremely likely' that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming.'  Moore pointed out 'There is no scientific proof that human emissions of carbon dioxide are the dominant cause of the minor warming of the Earth's atmosphere over the past 100 years,' arguing that 'perhaps the simplest way to expose the fallacy of extreme certainty is to look at the historical record.'  He told the committee: 'When modern life evolved over 500 million years ago, CO2 was more than 10 times higher than today, yet life flourished at this time. Then an ice age occurred 450 million years ago when carbon dioxide was 10 times higher than today.'  Moore also noted that 'The increase in temperature between 1910 and 1940 was virtually identical to the increase between 1970 and 2000. Yet the IPCC does not attribute the increase from 1910'1942 human influence.' Why then, he asks, 'does the IPCC believe that a virtually identical increase in temperature after 1950 is caused mainly by human influence, when it has no explanation for nearly identical increase from 1910 to 1940?'  Moore emphasized that there is no reason to believe that a warmer climate would be anything but beneficial for humans and the majority of other species. On the other hand, there is ample reason to believe that a sharp cooling of the climate would bring disastrous results for human civilization.  Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt, a prominent Socialist and a father of Germany's environmental movement, has become another strong critic of the IPCC's alarmist global warming doctrine. His lack of trust began while serving as an expert reviewer for an IPCC renewable energy report as the renewable energy division head of Germany's second largest utility company.  Upon discovering and pointing out numerous factual inaccuracies to IPCC officials, they simply brushed them aside. Stunned by this, he began to wonder if IPCC reports on climate change were similarly sloppy. After digging into the IPCC's climate report he was horrified to find similar incompetency and misrepresentations, including climate models that were fudged to produce exaggerated temperature increases.  Dr. Vahrenholt concluded: 'The facts need to be discussed sensibly and scientifically, without first deciding on the results.' And although CO2 may have some warming influence, he believes that the sun plays a far greater role in the whole scheme of things.  James Lovelock, a highly respected scientist, predicted in 2006 that: 'Before this century is over billions of us will die and the few breeding pairs of people that survive will be in the Arctic where climate remains tolerable.'  More recently, however, he admitted to MSNBC: 'We don't know what the climate is doing. We thought we knew 20 years ago. That led to some alarmist books . . . mine included . . . because it looked clear cut . . . but it hasn't happened.'  The 92-year-old Lovelock went on to note, 'The climate is doing its usual tricks . . . there's nothing much happening yet even though we were supposed to be halfway toward a frying world now.' He added, 'Yet the temperature has stayed almost constant, whereas it should have been rising . . . carbon dioxide has been rising, no question about that.'  Moore, Vahrenholt, and Lovelock are but three within an expanding multitude of scientists who are cooling on climate alarm.  When previously asked on Fox Business News who is responsible for promoting unwarranted fear and what their motives are, Moore said: 'A powerful convergence of interests. Scientists seeking grant money, media seeking headlines, universities seeking huge grants from major institutions, foundations, environmental groups, politicians wanting to make it look like they are saving future generations. And all of these people have converged on this issue.'  Moore warns that, 'The alarmism is driving us through scare tactics to adopt energy policies that are going to create a huge amount of energy poverty among the poor people. It's not good for people and it's not good for the environment. In a warmer world we can produce more food.'  Nobel Laureate physicist Dr. Ivar Giaever has referred to global warming ideology as a 'pseudoscience' that begins with an emotionally-appealing hypothesis, and 'then only looks for items which appear to support it,' while ignoring ample contrary evidence.  Tragically, that pseudoscience does greatest injustice to those who can least afford it.[2]  Pseudoscience is not science, the climate change claim was started by liberals and democrats. It is also supported by those politicians. Let me remind you that NASA is government funded, therefor does what the government wants.</t>

    <t>c1. 1) There hasn't been any global warming since 1997: If nothing changes in the next year, we're going to have kids who graduate from high school who will have never seen any 'global warming' during their lifetimes. That's right; the temperature of the planet has essentially been flat for 17 years. This isn't a controversial assertion either. Even the former Director of the Climate Research Unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia, Phil Jones, admits that it's true. Since the planet was cooling from 1940-1975 and the upswing in temperature afterward only lasted 22 years, a 17 year pause is a big deal. It also begs an obvious question: How can we be experiencing global warming if there's no actual 'global warming?' 2) There is no scientific consensus that global warming is occurring and caused by man: Questions are not decided by 'consensus.' In fact, many scientific theories that were once widely believed to be true were made irrelevant by new evidence. Just to name one of many, many examples, in the early seventies, scientists believed global cooling was occurring. However, once the planet started to warm up, they changed their minds. Yet, the primary 'scientific' argument for global warming is that there is a 'scientific consensus' that it's occurring. Setting aside the fact that's not a scientific argument, even if that ever was true (and it really wasn't), it's certainly not true anymore. Over 31,000 scientists have signed on to a petition saying humans aren't causing global warming. More than 1000 scientists signed on to another report saying there is no global warming at all. There are tens of thousands of well-educated, mainstream scientists who do not agree that global warming is occurring at all and people who share their opinion are taking a position grounded in science. 3) Arctic ice is up 50% since 2012: The loss of Arctic ice has been a big talking point for people who believe global warming is occurring. Some people have even predicted that all of the Arctic ice would melt by now because of global warming. Yet, Arctic ice is up 50% since 2012. How much Arctic ice really matters is an open question since the very limited evidence we have suggests that a few decades ago, there was less ice than there is today, but the same people who thought the drop in ice was noteworthy should at least agree that the increase is important as well. 4) Climate models showing global warming have been wrong over and over: These future projections of what global warming will do to the planet have been based on climate models. Essentially, scientists make assumptions about how much of an impact different factors will have; they guess how much of a change there will be and then they project changes over time. Unfortunately, almost all of these models showing huge temperature gains have turned out to be wrong. Former NASA scientist Dr. Roy Spencer says that climate models used by government agencies to create policies 'have failed miserably.' Spencer analyzed 90 climate models against surface temperature and satellite temperature data, and found that more than 95 percent of the models 'have over-forecast the warming trend since 1979, whether we use their own surface temperature dataset (HadCRUT4), or our satellite dataset of lower tropospheric temperatures (UAH).' There's an old saying in programming that goes, 'Garbage in, garbage out.' In other words, if the assumptions and data you put into the models are faulty, then the results will be worthless. If the climate models that show a dire impact because of global warming aren't reliable -- and they're not -- then the long term projections they make are meaningless. 5) Predictions about the impact of global warming have already been proven wrong: The debate over global warming has been going on long enough that we've had time to see whether some of the predictions people made about it have panned out in the real world. For example, Al Gore predicted all the Arctic ice would be gone by 2013. In 2005, the Independent ran an article saying that the Artic had entered a death spiral. Scientists fear that the Arctic has now entered an irreversible phase of warming which will accelerate the loss of the polar sea ice that has helped to keep the climate stable for thousands of years....The greatest fear is that the Arctic has reached a 'tipping point' beyond which nothing can reverse the continual loss of sea ice and with it the massive land glaciers of Greenland, which will raise sea levels dramatically. Of course, the highway is still there. Meanwhile, Arctic ice is up 50% since 2012. James Hansen of NASA fame predicted that the West Side Highway in New York would be under water by now because of global warming. If the climate models and the predictions about global warming aren't even close to being correct, wouldn't it be more scientific to reject hasty action based on faulty data so that we can further study the issue and find out what's really going on?  Rebuttal to physical realities 1. Scientists have only been observing temperature objectively since the 1970's, which proves pro wrong on this point. 2. My opponent provides links to few of his claims, so they should be considered false. 4. The record is less than 30 years (there were fluctuations until 1980), so I doubt this is any proof. Scientists can tell you how long a star upwards of 50 light-years away will die with more accuracy than telling you next week's weather. (Earth has very unpredictable climate and weather due to large amounts of liquid water.) Short-term warming is not the Earth's climate changing. 6. There have been 27-year long heat/cold fluctuations since 1428. (link above) 7. Actually, the 1900's are even better proof of this. (link above) 8. Pro has not fulfilled BoP, so it is safe to say that pro cannot prove this topic.</t>

    <t>Rebuttal to sources:Going over the sources you cited:The first is an anti-carbon sinking site. The idea of carbon sinking is that you store the CO2 in some medium, such as trees. The website argues against this practice and using trees with that practice. I never talked about carbon sinking which is often considered a bad practice but trees help sustain life.One mature tree supports two people. The second is saying something that is just a generally good rule, 'Don't put animals or plants into an enviornment that don't belong there'. The article basically says don't put trees when there has never trees. So instead of trees you restore the enviornment with its natural vegatative life.... I feel like you got in an argument with someone who really wanted cities to turn into some kind of jungle-forest-city thing... which I agree is a dumb idea, because....Rebuttal to Space Limitations and an Answer to Efficient Reforestation:Instead it would be more efficient to make areas of high population density and forested areas. Areas of high population density, New York and Hong Kong, have few to no trees but hold populations comparable to expansive cities like Houston. To be efficient, it would be best to built high-density urban areas that lower CO2 emmisions with smaller transportation infastructure (work is a mile away instead of ten miles away) and allow for the surronding areas to be massive forests.Rebuttal to Economic Loss:I couldn't find too much information on what you were saying of countries wasting massive amount of money currently on reforestation. Most of what I found was similar to what China is doing. Their reforestation to an attempt to rebuild the enviornment they destroyed and nature is having its revenge. Rebuttal to Animals and Humans thing:Again I feel like you talked with someone who wants jungle-city things. Under my former mentioned idea of high-density urban areas and the rest of the world reforested or back to a more original state, would mean that you wouldn't have tigers eating your kids (Hide you kids, hide your wives, because everybody gettin' eatin' up in here)I feel like you argued with someone about jungle-cities which are inefficient and unreasonable. Reforestation is a beneficial process and a good practice.Thanks for the debate :)</t>

    <t>Well, for the Second Round, I start with a new point.First of all, I would like to make some clarifications.* The Actual Point of Argument : I never said that 'the number of trees should be made to stay at a relative stable level and for us not to plant more than we use.' I wanted to say that, planting excess trees and turning cities into forests is not at all a good practice.* Relationship Between Animals (wild) and Humans : In this case, animals are considered to be wild. www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIrs_ZXXiLc (it's a You tube Video, though it states my point through a visual approach). Wild animals should be left at a restricted range. They should not be mixed up with human civilization. Now I would like to state the following points, against the topic:* ECONOMIC LOSSNow a days, most countries (as far as I know), plant large number of trees annually, more than an average level. They are influenced by some kind of 'Environment Saving without caring for Development'. They waste their money on buying trees, paying the labourers' salary and some trade taxes (if they import the trees from foreign countries).* LIMITING SPACES AVAILABLE FOR USEMaking a forest in cities, limits the area available for public use. We can use the land for making schools, homes for the poor and/or utilize it for some general welfare of the people. For examples, open grounds for playing should not be covered with tall trees. Or take the example of planting too many trees near the houses. In the long run, the roots of the trees would damage the buildings, the cleaning fallen leaves would be a major problem and the houses would be finally termed as 'haunted' (according to some, though).So I would like to conclude with the following:'Planting trees is good, indeed. But choosing the right type of plant, the right place and the right time is a problem. So, trees must be planted judiciously.</t>

    <t>To fully understand you stance, you want the number of trees to stay at a relative stable level and for us not to plant more than we use.  The largest factor in deforestation is slash and burn farming. Areas affected by this need excessive reforestation to deal with the massive decline of nutrients in the soil. Much of the 'farmland' used in the process is wasted. Additionally, without trying to make this a global warming debate, reforestation will help deal with the increase of CO2 in the air. This will help with global warming (if you believe in it). As far as I know, land utilization has not become a global issue yet (in some countries yes, but globally no) so reforestation would not mean getting rid of civilized areas. I think you BoP on saying the globe has can't reforest in a large scale because of land restrictions because I couldn't find anything in either direction which leads me to believe its not really an issue.  The thing with animals and humans together: umm.... I am going to wait for clarification on this. As far as I know, there is not a major issue with animals invading peoples homes in rural areas so I don't see how having trees in urban and suburban areas would be an issue.</t>

    <t>Dear readers,  Today I stand against the topic 'Planting Excess Trees Is A Good Practice'.  Planting Trees is a very good practice, indeed. In this world where the numbers of trees are going down rapidly, trees must be planted in greater numbers. However, anything in excess is not good.  It is true that trees provide us with oxygen, food, shelter and other useful products; but it also snatches away the place to grow crops, the area to build human shelters amongst others. It is said that by build apartment style of buildings, we can save area for planting trees. But I am against this. If this is to be done, what will be the difference between people living in jungles and people living in civilized areas?  Trees are home to millions of animals. But, many of them are poisonous. Turning cities into dense forests would invite them to live with people. I wouldn't be surprised, if in this case, a black widow spider and a man would share the same bed.  Trees must be planted; we cannot do without it. But, they should be planted in reasonable numbers.</t>

    <t>Thanks for accepting the debate!! I am definitely not a debate master like some people on here, but this should be interesting and fun.  Now, just for the sake of complete clarity, I will state my purpose and what I will (try to) prove.  Saying that Obama sucks is saying that he barely did anything right, and botched everything.  I am NOT arguing that Obama was a perfect president, I will express points that prove that he handled many situations well and passed some good policy.  No politician tells the truth 100% of the time, and although I realize that it's terrible for them to lie, please refrain from going over the 'Obama said... but...' arguments because those arguments can be made against practically any politician.   Obama has done a lot of work to help people as president.  I will be detailing his work in civil rights, education, and the environment, but will talk about other aspects in my final argument.  Civil RightsObama has always been a figure for civil rights.  Aside from being the first African American president in United States history, he has passed many laws helping minorities.  He is especially active in LGBT rights.  Very recently, he has announced plans to sign an executive ban on sexual orientation-based discrimination in the workplace [1].  Gays, lesbians etc. are often discriminated against in the workplace, in fact many are fired just because they are gay.  Many lawmakers, however, refuse to admit that it is even a problem.  I know that this isn't representative of all politicians, but there are many anti-gay politicians like Al Melvin who don't even agree that its a problem that LGBT's are being unfairly discriminated against.  Watch an interview of Al by Anderson Cooper here [2] (I was shocked by Al's denial) and thank the lucky stars that we don't have an anti-gay president like that.  Also, Obama works with improving the situation of minorities.  Low income minority families have significant educational and emotional disadvantages, for example, a child raised in a low-income scenario hears about 30 million less words than a child raised in a family with money in only the first 3 years of childhood.  Minorities have had problems, but Obama is passing legistlation to help them get out of their rut with the help of many foundations.  [3] One of his great characteristics is that he relates to people, and isn't afraid to admit that he made many of the mistakes that these minorities have made.  Ability to relate to his fellow countrymen is an important skill for a president to have.  EducationObama knows that smart kids make a smart future.  He has done SO much for education.  This includes increasing funding for the nation's future (smart), initiating Race to the Top (which has helped MILLIONS of kids benefit from higher education standards), and starting programs to aid college students in paying their debts.  No child should worry about affording an education as a reason to not go to college. [4] EnvironmentAgain, Obama is looking to the future in terms of the environment as well.  The president illustrates humour and planning in this speech [5].  His ideas are important, and make sense.  He recognizes global warming as a problem that must be corrected, unlike many lawmakers, and proposes many steps to help solve the problem, unlike many lawmakers.  These steps include limiting the pollution produced by big companies, investing in clean energy technologies, and more savvy steps [6]So my punch line is that Obama has unarguably screwed up on many occasions, just like practically every politician that ever  existed.  And.... just to satisfy me.... I want to say this to the people who say Obama=Hitler, but Severus beat me to it.</t>

    <t>Misty, I am sad that you were unable to provide a response or defense to my argument, but I will pursue to respond, in short (very), to your argument for the sake of validating my own position.  In your argument, you brought three issues that you believe Obama has handled quite well, that removes him from the 'sucks' category: Civil rights, education, and environment. These issues are important, of course, and anyone willing to ignore or downplay these issues is not only deserving of a leadership position, but also damaging their own political success. But,, that is just the point. Anyone can (should) agree that all men are created equal, and thereby subject to the same birth rights as everyone else. Anyone can fight, or merely just appear to fight, for the advancement and improvement of our educational system. And anyone can agree that, aside from the debate of global warming, we as a people need to change the way we produce, consume, and live in order to manage resources and provide waste management. The difference is how a leader and/or his administration go about defining these issues and how best to address them, which is best contrasted in the difference between the political right and left. Ultimately, this is expected, and what one president/party achieve in their term, is easily reverted in the other. These issues will flip back and forth because of the majority's difference of opinion, and how their leaders defend their constituency.  However, the issues that are hard, the ones that leaders don't wish to address publicly with the people are the tough decisions and issues I mentioned above. The advent of global militarization via drones, privacy rights of the individual counter to constitutional provisions, and a flip-flop foreign policy justification for either taking direct action or providing indirect consent for action. Obama has avoided confronting these issues publicly because he believes (I believe) that he is and has been in the wrong on these and other issues, and cannot address these issues, until information on how they are being handled behind the scenes is leaked out. Obama had a chance to make a change, and to undo so many things from the previous Bush administration that he publicly stated were wrong, but sadly, he has not only allowed them, he has advanced them.  I'll give credit where credit is due, he has done, as you mentioned, many great things to better our nation and humanity, but in the end we have to remember that it is not the easy decisions that anyone can make, but how they react to the tough issues, pressures, and circumstances that make or break any leader. In this aspect, Obama has failed in my reasons provided, in addition to many others, both know now, and later to be declassified.</t>

Framework Pro will argue that Bernie Sanders should be the next president, whilst Con will argue that Rand Paul should be the next president. Burdens Pro and Con will bear equal burdens of proof. Criterion The criterion, or the way in which 'should' will apply in this debate, will be the betterment of society. For example, Pro will argue that society would be better off with Bernie Sanders as president than with Rand Paul as president. Con will argue that society would be better off with Rand Paul as presdent than with Bernie Sanders as president. Background Bernie Sanders: 'American politician and the junior United States Senator from Vermont. Before serving in the Senate, he represented Vermont's at-large district in the United States  and served as mayor of Burlington, the largest city in Vermont. Sanders is a self-described democratic socialist, and has praised Scandinavian-style socal democracy.' Rand Paul: 'the junior United States Senator for Kentucky. He is a member of the Republican Party and the son of former U.S. Representative and presidential candidate Ron Paul of Texas. He first received national attention in 2008 when making political speeches on behalf of his father, who was campaigning for the Republican Party's nomination for president. During his father's final term in the house, he was the first United States senator to have served simultaneously with a parent in the United States House of Represenatives.' StructureRound 1 Pro will provide the rules, structure, and resolutionCon will offer his opening contentionsRound 2 Pro will offer his opening arguments and will have the chance to rebut Con will offer his first rebuttal Round 3 Pro will offer his first rebuttal Con will offer his final rebuttal and closing remarksRound 4 Pro will offer his final rebuttal and closing remarks Con will post 'Pass' so that both debaters have an even number of rounds Rules1. The rules, stipulations, structure, etc. cannot be changed after the point of acceptance.2. Any deviation from the rules will merit a loss. This is particularly applicable to the rule that Con must pass Round 4 to even out the rounds. 3. Any forfeit will merit a loss.  4.

    <t>I'm going to mostly spend this round to build my own case, largely because I run low on characters and CON hasn't offered any arguments, but has merely stated several of Paul's positions. On top of that there is hardly any specifity or explicit sourcing, so I would ask CON to flesh out his contentions. I'm not responsible for pouring through his sources to discover the contentions he intended to offer. Merely stating that Paul supported X position doesn't mean that Paul should be president; CON needs to tell us how X position would benefit the country and how Paul would be preferable to Sanders.I.  Experience Experence is obviously a critical factor for any presidential hopeful. Congressional gridlock is worse than it has ever been, and the current Congress has been deemed the 'least productive Congress ever,' passing fewer bills than any Congress that preceded it (1). Therefore, a presidential candidate must not only be firm and steadfast in what he stands for, but willing to communicate effectively with members of the opposition party. This requires congressional experience. In much the same way that you would hire a gardener to do gardening work and a plumber to do plumbing work, you would want a politician to do political work. The majority of Senator Paul's career is not as a Senator, but as an optamalogist (2). Bernie Sanders served 14 years in the U.S. House of Representatives before he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2006 (3). This means that he has served in the U.S. Congress for about 24 years, in addition to four terms as Mayor of Burlington (3). Compare this to Rand Paul, who was only elected in 2010 to the U.S. Senate, meaning that he only has 4 years of experience (4). Bernie also serves on five congressional committees -- Budget; Veterans; Energy; Environment; and Health, Education, Labor and Pensions -- and chairs the Veterans committee (3). II. Policy Priorities We should have a president whose prioritizes the issues most critical to the country's survival. Sander's stated priorities are as follows: 'the shrinking middle class and widening income gap in America that is greater than at any time since the Great Depression. Other priorities include reversing global warming, universal health care, fair trade policies, supporting veterans and preserving family farms' (3). By contrast, Rand Paul's priorities are 'term limits, a balanced-budget amendment, a Read the Bills Act, and an audit of the Federal Reserve' (4).  Why hasn't he mentioned climate change, income inequality, healthcare, veterans, etc.? The reason, by and large, is that Rand Paul doesn't believe the government ought to intervene in these issues; he's a 'free market' ideologue who believes that, if government steps out of the way, everything will be beautiful and miraculous. We know from history that this isn't the case: that markets, left to their own devices, are not perfectly efficient, omnibenevolent, omniscient creatures, and this is largely because people are not rational actors, nor do they have perfect information. In fact, we had much larger government from 1945 to 1980, with tax rates between 71 and 94 percent (5), and the economy boomed to the benefit of everyone, not just the very affluent. Sanders has cited this time as his inspiration, whereas Paul chooses to simply ignore it or to deny reality.Paul's priorities, however, are embarassing. Term limits are hardly a relevant issue, especially when initiatives to place them on the ballot have been largely funded by the billionaire Koch brothers (6), oil moguls set on funding misinformation campaigns on climate change (because green enrgy would invite competition to the oil industry), to fighting the minimum wage, the Affordable Care Act, etc. (7). Conveniently, many Koch-funded industries as well as large corporations have contributed to Rand Paul's campaigns over the years (8). The reason they want term limits? The people who would be effected are mostly Democrats. We have term limits: they're called elections. Why in the world would we want to prevent politicians from gaining experience and allow people to make their own decisions? Term limits simply wouldn't fix any problems, especially when we consider the revolving door exists, anyway, and this hardly addresses it, as politicians would simply become lobbyists after their time in office is up.  He is also ignorant of monetary policy, which tells me that his nomination for Fed Chairman -- who would wield an immense amount of power and could literally propel the economy in a permanent slump by following Paul's hawkish rhetoric and raising interest rates -- would be disastrous. He's expressed a fervor that Fed is raising the cost of goods and hurting poor people (9). In supporting and campaigning for his father, who wanted to end the Fed (10), he endorsed a policy that is utterly absurd. It would bring us back to the panics of the 1800s and early 1900s which occured roughly every 20 years, before we had a central bank committed to financial stability (11). His policy of auditing is also misguided. Not only is he dead wrong on inflation -- inflation is only about 2 percent right now, and has consistently been below the Fed's targets in recent years (12), largely because banks have accumulated about $2.5 trillion in excess reserves (13), and his statement that the Fed affects food and gas prices is mendacious (14) -- but the policy he supports (auditing the Fed) would actually cause MORE inflation. There's a wide body of academic literature showing a negative correlation between central bank independence and inflation, most notably from Alesina and Summers (15).A balanced budget amendment is also a joke, as it would force the federal government to adhere to a dogmatic standard at all times -- not factoring in that during a downturn, due to a lack of aggregate demand, the government needs to prime the pump -- which would force through austerity. The negative impacts of austerity on the European periphery are widely known and profound (16), and have even been linked to about 500 suicides in Greece (17). In Greece, austerity actually INCREASED the debt: G.D.P. ratio because as GDP contracted, tax revenues fell which led to an unrelenting cycle of deleveraging and unemployment. An exceptional case against the BBA comes from Paul Krugman, who argues that setting a GDP cap for the federal budget is ludicrous (18). As the economy enters recession and GDP contracts, tax revenues fall. Not only are we taking in less revenue, but now we're taking the same percentage out of a smaller GDP figure. This would impose massive austerity that would have the same effect on the U.S. as it did in Greece: higher debt to G.D.P. ratios and more unemployment. John Maynard Keynes was vindicated after the military buildup for WWII ended the Great Depression (19): spend more during a downturn and cut back during a recession. Sanders believes in this principle, which is part of the reason that he would be an exceptional president economically speaking.  III. Paul is Ignorant of ScienceClimate change is one of the most severe threats to the future of the planet, and has broader economic implications, particularly on food security. There is no debate over whether this is caused by humans: 97.1% of scientific papers on this subject support the fact that it is caused by humans (20). The U.S. military recognizes the danger of climate change (21), arguing that it impacts military readiness and creates missions overseas. Paul, however, is a climate-change denier (22). Though even many conservative economists such as Greg Mankiw and Scott Sumner support a carbon tax, acknowledging the perils of climate change, Paul like the ideologus he is, writes it off because it would require government intervention. Paul said he wants the U.S. to drill in 'every, possible conceivable place' (23). Not only would this ludicrous idea have dire environmental ramifications, but the U.S. is already the world's largest oil producer (24), so Paul isn't even properly diagnosing the problem. Sanders, on the other hand, has considered climate change to be one of our top threats and has been a leader on addressing this issue (25).IV. EconomicsI've already explained why Sanders is good economically speaking: he understands the threat of income inequality and how it impacts middle- and lower-income families. Paul's proposals, however, will merely exacerbate it. I run low on characters so I can't get into this as much as I would like, though it's a central issue to my case so I will expand on it in later rounds. We know that Paul's proposals of even more austeirty and even more tax cuts will merely widen this gap and expand the influence of the rich in politics. Is it not curious that Paul is against abolishing corporate personhood (26) (and is working with Citizens United to abolish the IRS (27) which is corrupting politics, while Sanders has been a leader in ending the Citizens United decision and restoring democracy (28)? Research shows us that the U.S. is becoming an oligarchy (29), and Paul's policies merely exacerbate that.</t>

    <t>I gladly accept this debate. I will be arguing that Rand Paul should be the next United States president instead of Bernie Sanders. I think that one of the best things about both of these people is that they are very close to third parties. Sanders in considered an Independent, and Rand Paul is pretty close to Libertarian. I think that our government under both Bush and Obama, has gotten a little too left or right.  Here is where Rand Paul stands on some issues. - He is for budget cuts. He believes that the government in Washington spends much more than they should. Libertarians believe in limited government. That's where he is on this issue. - He believes that the government should intervene less on education. - He thinks that we should look for solutions to energy right here in America. We should stop spending money in other countries such as Iceland, that have effective alternate energy sources. -He is for military action when it is justified. - He is against Obamacare. - He fully supports legal immigrants who have come here and made a decent life for themselves. However, he is for more strict border security. Almost twelve million people are living in the United States illegally. Why should they be able to stay here illegally when other hard working people come here legally? - He is against gun control. Proposed gun control laws only restrict on responsible gun ownership. Criminals will still be able to obtain guns. - Paul thinks that our Tax Code needs to be reformed. - He is absolutely for helping our veterans.  I agree with Paul on most, if not all of his stances. I think that if he helps enforce his opinions as a president, the country will thrive more a lot more than it has under Obama or Bush.  Let me know some of Bernie Sanders's stances, as well as provide rebuttals.</t>

<h>My opponent has not made a single argument for his position or a refutation of my arguments. His entire argument in round 3 is a source war (when the debate revolves around the number of sources each debater can put forth). Not only does it not satisfy his burden of proof, it is no way to argue. In this argument, I will first consider his introductory points, then proceed to refute the relevant arguments he made from his first argument, and finally show how his source war does not prove his point, especially on scientific topics.  My opponent has not shown how his arguments are relevant, as he hasn't addressed my arguments as to how they aren't relevant. Also, from the resolution and the arguments you have put forth, you have been arguing that humans have been a significant, if not the main cause of the modern global warming. I've been showing how they're not.  Refutations  Climate Models  Climate models are far from perfect. In fact, they have consistently overestimated warming. 'The computer models predict that the 20th century temperatures should have increased by 1.6 to 3.74 Celsius, while the actual observed 20th-century temperature increase was about 0.6 Celsius. A model that fails to history match is useless for predicting the future.'[1]  Here is a graph showing various climate model predictions to actual temperatures:    'The IPCC models projected the global 17-year SST trend ending August 2011 at 0.15 C/decade, but the observed rise was only 0.02 C/decade... The quoted error on a single measurement is 0.05 C. The probability that the IPCC projections overstate the warming in greater than 90%.' I could go on more about this, but since my opponent has provided no proof of the validity of climate models, this will suffice.[1]  To conclude, here is a prediction made by a climate model:  Built in cooling trend until at least 2024 Temperature Hadsst3 moving average anomaly 2035 - 0.15 Temperature Hadsst3 moving average anomaly 2100 ' 0.5 General Conclusion ' by 2100 all the 20th century temperature rise will have been reversed.[2]  Why should we believe the models that predict excessive warming instead of models that predict a decrease in temperatures.  Water Vapor Feedback  Once again, the predictions to not match up with the observations. The feedback predicts relative humidity to remain constant so that the atmosphere can hold more water vapor with increased temperatures. However, humidity has actually fallen. This doesn't only negate the supposed positive feedback, but if the decrease is large enough, it may actually become a negative feedback.  Here is a graph showing relative humidity over the last 60 years:    'This shows that the actual water vapor content in the upper troposphere has declined by 13.7% (best fit line) from 1948 to 2012 at the 400 mb pressure level. The climate models predict that humidity will increase in the upper troposphere, but the data shows a large decrease; just where water vapor changes have the greatest effect on global temperatures.'[1]  Ocean Acidification  Actually, claims of ocean acidification have been greatly exaggerated and misinterpreted. The mean drop in pH levels as a result of CO2 increases is around 0.3, but the sea can experience changes of almost 1.4 in as little as just a day. 'On a monthly scale the pH varies by 0.024 to 1.430 pH units.''At Puerto Morelos (in Mexico's easternmost state, on the Yucat'n Peninsula) the pH varied as much as 0.3 units per hour due to groundwater springs.''Even the more stable and vast open ocean is not a fixed pH all year round. Hofmann writes that 'Open-water areas (in the Southern Ocean) experience a strong seasonal shift in seawater pH (~0.3'0.5 units) between austral summer and winter.''[3][4]  This is the paper's hypothesis: 'This natural variability has prompted the suggestion that an appropriate null hypothesis may be, until evidence is obtained to the contrary, that major biogeochemical processes in the oceans other than calcification will not be fundamentally different under future higher CO2/lower pH conditions'[3][4]  The Consensus  This argument has employed by pro in both his first argument as an argument, and in this round to support his position. However, both instances commit both a fallacy and a gross inaccuracy.  First, the fallacy. Science does not work by consensus. The number of researchers or organizations has little bearing on whether what they believe is actually true. Michael Crichton has said, 'Consensus is the business of politics. Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world. In science consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus.' My opponent has said that petroleum companies supporting climate change deniers is a conflict of interest, but so are governmental organizations, because legislators want them to provide information that will support the legislation will support. Politics in science hardly makes for objective conclusions.[1]  Even so, the consensus doesn't even exist in the first place. Over 31,000 scientists (with at least a Bachelors' degree in relevant fields) have signed a petition saying that global warming is not anthropogenic. The Heartland Institute has conducted an international survey of 530 climate scientists in 2003. The survey asked if the current state of scientific knowledge is developed well enough to allow for a reasonable assessment of the effects of greenhouse gases. Two-thirds of the scientists surveyed (65.9 percent) disagreed with the statement, with nearly half (45.7 percent) scoring it with a 1 or 2, indicating strong disagreement. Only 10.9 percent scored it with a 6 or 7, indicating strong agreement. Most of the organizations my opponent lists are governmental, meaning that they have that conflict of interest I mentioned earlier.[5][6]  The graphs my opponent provides are either irrelevant, are refuted by my argument against the consensus above, or show a rough correlation between CO2 and temperature that I have already shown to not exist. It is also relevant to note that the r^2 correlation between CO2 and temperature over the last century is only 0.44, which is considered poor.[7]  Also, as for the other greenhouse gases, my opponent has not argued for them specifically, concentrating on CO2 in his arguments. Regardless, I will simply refer to my fourth argument in the last round on greenhouse gas absorption. Methane has an absorption band (at 8 micrometres) that largely overlaps with water vapor, so an increase in methane has little effect on temperature. In addition to methane, the wavelengths of light that nitrous oxide absorb largely overlap with that of water vapor, so an increase in nitrous oxide also has little effect on temperature. Those are the main greenhouse gases. I will address these more if my opponent considers them any more than he has.[1]  Conclusion  My opponent's entire argument in this round is a fallacious attempt to make his position seem valid when he can't refute the arguments I made in the first round. Again, science does not work by consensus, and even so, there really is no 'consensus'. Pro has never gotten near satisfying his BoP that humans are causing climate change.</h>

    <t>I would like to thank CarterWale for presenting his arguments. The resolution is that humans have caused the modern climate change. However, most of my opponent's arguments either deals with the existence of global warming itself, or rules out (rather invalidly) other alternatives. He does very little to actually satisfy his burden of proof that humans are causing global warming. My arguments will be predicated on one simple assumption ' that the vast majority of the claimed human impact is the result of greenhouse gas emissions.  Humans Have Not Caused the Modern Global Warming  There are many indicators that point to CO2 emissions not being the cause of the modern global warming.  First, CO2 is actually a lagging indicator compared to temperature. As it turns out, temperature may be what's causing CO2 levels to rise. 'The most recent study on this concluded that the results of their tedious but meticulous analysis led them to ultimately conclude that 'the CO2 increase lagged Antarctic deglacial warming by 800 +/- 200 years.' There is also shorter correlations, but again, temperature seems to cause CO2 rise instead of the reverse.[1]  This graph shows just one of the lags:    [1]  Second, according to the greenhouse effect, global warming should be starting from the lower atmosphere and moving to the surface (because the CO2 collects in the upper troposphere first). However, this is not happening. '...satellite and high-altitude balloon data confirm that the lower atmosphere is not trapping lots of additional heat due to higher CO2 concentrations. It is hard to know how fast the Earth's highly variable surface is warming, but it is warming faster than the lower atmosphere where the CO2 is accumulating. This is strong evidence that CO2 is not the primary climate factor.'[2]  Here is a graph showing how the surface has warmed more than the troposphere:    [1] (Blue line is lower troposphere temperature)  Third, global warming is not starting at the poles like it should be, by the greenhouse theory. In fact, there has been general, relative cooling: 'If the greenhouse theory were valid, temperatures in the Arctic and the Antarctic would have risen several degrees Celsius since 1940 due to the huge emissions of man-made CO2... Recently, a team led by the University of Chicago's Peter Doran published a paper in Nature saying, 'Although previous reports suggest recent continental warming, our spatial analysis of Antarctic meteorological data demonstrates a net cooling on the Antarctic continent between 1966 and 2000'. The data from 21 Antarctic surface stations show an average continental decline of 0.008 degrees C from 1978 to 1998, and the infrared data from satellites operating since 1979 show a decline of 0.42 degrees C per decade. David W. J. Thompson of Colorado State University and Susan Soloman of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration also report a cooling trend in the Antarctic interior. ... report that satellite imaging shows increases in Southern Ocean sea ice parameters from 1978 to 1996 and an increase in the length of the sea-ice season in the 1990s.'[2]  To illustrate, here is a picture of the southern hemisphere sea ice anomaly, which shows that southern sea ice is actually increasing:    [3]  Fourth, current levels of CO2 have very little effect on temperature. The greenhouse effect certainly exists, but it doesn't become linearly stronger with increasing amounts of CO2. CO2's effect on temperature is logarithmic, meaning that each additional increase has a smaller effect on the climate than the last. 'The carbon that is already up in the atmosphere absorbs most of the light it can. CO2 only soaks up its favorite wavelengths of light and it's close to its saturation point. It manages to grab a bit more light from wavelengths that are close to its favorite bands but it can't do much more, because there are not many left-over photons at the right wavelengths.'[1][4]  This chart shows approximately the effect that each additional increment of CO2 increase has on temperature:    [4]  Note how the pre-industrial to modern level increase has had less than a 0.2 C increase in temperature.  Fifth and most importantly, the predicted 'hot-spot' 10 miles above the tropics that would be a signature of CO2-induced global warming is absent. 'The computer models show that greenhouse warming will cause a hot-spot at an altitude between 8 and 12 km over the tropics between 30 N and 30 S. The temperature at this hot-spot is projected to increase at a rate of two to three times faster than at the surface. However, the Hadley Centre's real-world plot of radiosonde temperature observations shown below does not show the projected CO2 induced global warming hot-spot at all. The predicted hot-spot is entirely absent from the observational record. This shows that atmosphere warming theory programmed into climate models are wrong.'[1]  Here is the plot of predicted temperature changes due to CO2:    However, here is the actual observed temperature changes:    [1]  The hot spot is completely missing, which is pretty much a knockout blow to the anthropogenic global warming theory.  Even so, CO2 has not correlated well with the climate anyway. Throughout the past 600 million years, almost one-seventh of the age of the Earth, the mode of global surface temperatures was ~22C, even when carbon dioxide concentration peaked at 7000 ppmv, almost 20 times today's near-record-low concentration.  Here is a graph showing CO2 concentrations versus temperature over the past 600 million years:    [1]  Note especially how high CO2 concentrations were earlier in Earth's history, reaching as high as 7000 ppmv. It was around 4500 ppmv during the very cold Ordovician era.  Considering My Opponent's Arguments  I was going to wait until the next round to consider his arguments, but after reading them, I thought I would discredit the majority of pro's arguments, as they aren't even worth arguing against.  Arguments 1-3 are irrelevant - they don't show how human-emitted greenhouse gases have caused global warming. Argument 4 eliminates (rather invalidly) that the sun is not causing global warming ' that still doesn't show that humans are causing global warming. Arguments 5 and 6 are relevant and I will consider them. Arguments 7 and 9-12 just show evidence for global warming ' not anthropogenic global warming. Arguments 8, 13, and 14 will be considered.  So essentially, only arguments 5, 6, 8, 13, and 14 are relevant to the resolution that pro made. All the rest either only prove global warming itself or demonstrate that humans have caused the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, and so have no bearing on a debate considering anthropogenic global warming.  I will consider those relevant arguments and those arguments only in the next round, along with any objections pro has to my own arguments. </t>

    <t>Main point - Every major science academy in the west supports it, 97%-98% of scientist support it.  1. 75% of the 20th century increase in the atmospheric greenhouse gas CO2 is directly caused by human actions like burning fossil fuels. CO2 levels were 389ppm (parts per million) as of Apr. 2010 - the highest they have been in the past 650,000 years. This increase in CO2 was a substantial contributor to the 1'F to 1.4'F warming over the 20th century.  2. Human-produced CO2 is warming the earth, not natural CO2 released from the ocean and other 'carbon sinks.' CO2 from fossil fuel combustion has a specific isotopic ratio that is different from CO2 released by natural 'carbon sinks.' 20th century measurements of CO2 isotope ratios in the atmosphere confirm that the rise results from human activities, not natural processes.  3. Human produced greenhouse gases will continue to accumulate in the atmosphere causing climate change because the earth's forests, oceans, and other 'carbon sinks' cannot adequately absorb them all. As of 2009, these carbon sinks were only absorbing about 50% of human-produced CO2. The other 50% is accumulating in the atmosphere.  4. Human greenhouse gas emissions, not changes in the sun's radiation, are causing global climate change. Measurements in the upper atmosphere from 1979 - 2009, show the sun's energy has gone up and down in cycles, with no net increase. While warming is occurring in the troposphere (lower atmosphere), the stratosphere (upper atmosphere) is cooling. If the sun was driving the temperature change there would be warming in the stratosphere also, not cooling.  5. Computer models show that increased levels of human produced greenhouse gases will cause global warming and other climate changes. Although these climate models are uncertain about how much future warming will occur and how it will affect the climate, they all agree that, to some degree, these changes will happen. The reality of climate change is not contradicted by this uncertainty.  6. Although the amount of human-produced greenhouse gases may seem small to some people, their warming potential is amplified by the water vapor positive feedback loop , allowing them to cause significant warming and climate change. As greenhouse gases heat the planet, increased humidity (water vapor in the atmosphere) results. Since water vapor is itself a greenhouse gas, it can double the warming effect of greenhouse gases such as CO2.  7. Human greenhouse gas emissions are heating the planet, and climate models consistently show that this warming causes an increase in the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones. The fact that 1975-1989 had 171 category 4 and 5 hurricanes while 1990-2004 had 269 [51] of them (a 57% increase) validates these climate models and the reality of human-induced climate change.  8. Human-produced CO2 is changing the climate of the world's oceans. As excess CO2 is absorbed, oceanic acidity levels increase. Oceans have absorbed 48% of the total CO2 released by human activities and acidity levels are 25-30% higher than prior to human fossil fuel use.  9. An 8' rise in the ocean level has occured (1961-2003) due to human-induced global warming. Global sea levels rose an average of 1.8 mm (.07 in) per year between 1961 and 2003 and at an average rate of about 3.1 mm (.1 in) per year from 1993 to 2003. [3] This sea level rise is the result of warming waters and the melting of glaciers, ice caps, and polar ice sheets. From 1870-2004, a 'significant acceleration' of sea-level rise occured, an important confirmation of climate change models.  10. Warming caused by human-produced greenhouse gases is changing the earth's hydrologic climate. Rainfall is increasing in many areas due to increased evaporation stemming from global warming. Higher temperatures are also causing some mountainous areas to receive rain rather than snow. According to researchers at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, up to 60% of the changes in river flow, winter air temperature, and snow pack in the western US (1950-1999) were human-induced.  11. Warming caused by human-produced greenhouse gases is changing the rate of glacial melt and altering the local climate of many regions. Since 1850, records show a 'strong increase' in the rate of glacial retreat. From 1961-2004 glaciers retreated about .5mm per year in sea level equivalent. According to the World Glacier Monitoring Service, since 1980, glaciers worldwide have lost nearly 40 feet (12 meters) in average thickness (measured in average mass balance in water equivalent).  12. Warming caused by human-produced greenhouse gases and soot (black carbon) produced from burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, is reducing the size of the Arctic ice cap. A smaller ice cap reflects less of the sun's energy away from the earth. This energy is absorbed instead, causing air and water temperatures to rise. From 1953'2006, Arctic sea ice declined 7.8% per decade. Between 1979 and 2006, the decline was 9.1% each decade. Climate models predict that Arctic sea ice will continue to retreat through the 21st century further disrupting the global climate. [15]  13. Many organizations believe that human activity is a substantial cause of global climate change. These groups include: the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the InterAcademy Council, the Network of African Science Academies, the European Science Foundation (ESF), the European Space Agency (ESA), the Royal Society (UK national academy of science), the US National Academies of Science, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  14. Nearly all climate change studies show humans as the main cause, and studies which contradict this claim are often funded by petroleum companies, making their conclusions suspect given the obvious conflict of interest. From 2004-2005, ExxonMobil gave $2.2 million in grants for climate change research to organizations that deny human caused climate change. In 2006 US Senators Olympia Snowe (R-ME), and Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) chastised ExxonMobil for providing more than $19 million in funding to over 29 'climate change denial front groups.'</t>

    <t>I hope this will be a fun and interesting debate with whoever accepts this challenge. First, is global warming actually happening? According to NASA, the average temperature has raised by 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880. According to the United Nations, the past two decades have been the hottest in more than 400 years. Arctic ice is rapidly disappearing, and the region may have its first completely ice-free summer by 2040 or earlier. Polar bears and indigenous cultures are already suffering from the sea-ice loss. Glaciers and mountain snows are rapidly melting'for example, Montana's Glacier National Park now has only 27 glaciers, versus 150 in 1910. In the Northern Hemisphere, thaws also come a week earlier in spring and freezes begin a week later. An upsurge in the amount of extreme weather events, such as wildfires, heat waves, and strong tropical storms, is also attributed in part to climate change by some experts.  Second, are humans causing global warming? The report, based on the work of some 2,500 scientists in more than 130 countries, concluded that humans have caused all or most of the current planetary warming. Human-caused global warming is often called anthropogenic climate change. Humans are pouring carbon dioxide into the atmosphere much faster than plants and oceans can absorb it.  Third, what is likely to occur in the future? Sea level could rise between 7 and 23 inches by century's end. Rises of just 4 inches could flood many South Seas islands and swamp large parts of Southeast Asia. Some hundred million people live within 3 feet of average sea level, and much of the world's population is concentrated in vulnerable coastal cities. In the U.S., Louisiana and Florida are especially at risk. Glaciers around the world could melt, causing sea levels to rise while creating water shortages in regions dependent on runoff for fresh water. Strong hurricanes, droughts, heat waves, wildfires, and other natural disasters may become commonplace in many parts of the world. The growth of deserts may also cause food shortages in many places.

<h>I do not deny that there has been an increase of temperatures since the mid 1800’s, nor will I deny that CO2 emissions have increased over the same period. What I do take an  issue with is the claim that the increase of CO2 emissions is the cause of the warming in the last 100 or so years.   1. Climate sensitivity   The direct effect of CO2 on warming has been demonstrated in laboratories time and time again. The fact is, the greenhouse effect is real and that an increase in CO2 will lead to some warming, the question still remains: how much.   The direct effect from CO2 is not significant. CO2, which has a logarithmic warming effect, becomes less potent per each molecule of CO2 emitted each molecule that is created. All in all, the direct effect of CO2 leads to insignificant warming amounts. AGW proponents claim that there are positive feedbacks--i.e. amplifiers. The small added warming from the CO2 causes a chain of reactions and the warming increases exponentially, causing a runaway greenhouse effect. Generally, alarmists claim that doubling CO2 with the added effects lead to about 3.3 degrees C of warming, whereas skeptics claim it will be much less: with some estimates around 1 degree C, others at 0.5-0.6 degrees C [1]. If alarmists are correct, CO2 likely caused the majority of the 20th century warming. If skeptics are correct, CO2 has played a negligible role in the recent warming and will continue to play a negligible role in the future.   Now, what does the data argue on this issue? Alarmists base their predictions on climate models. Climate models model temperature based on data that climate modelers--who are not always scientists--put inside the computer. The issue is that this method of data is flawed. How do we get these alarmist predictions? A lot of climate models exist. They all meet together--all the modelers--to compare their data. Some models produce little warming, others produce a lot. They then claim the real answer is in between, they choose one of the middle answers. However, this may not be the correct answer. The fact is, the answer could be any of the models, or none of them at all, however they merely claim it must me the middle answer, which as you can see, is a flawed approach to such a complex system.   The above statements can be evidenced by a simple fact: the models are wrong. The vast majority of models produce too much sensitivity, and the average ‘middle ground’ is significantly above observed temperatures [2]. There is significant scientific evidence published in the peer reviewed academic research that argues the sensitivity predicted by the alarmists is incorrect, and that we should expect minimal warming from doubling of CO2 emissions [3].   2. Climate predictions have been wrong for the last decade  A theory is as good as its predictions. You make a hypothesis, predict what you think is going to happen, and compare the actual data. If your predictions are off, you need to change the hypothesis. The fact is, AGW predictions have been off and need to be corrected to claim the effect of humans is much smaller than once thought.   Warming in the last decade has been far below the expected temperature increase. There has been either no warming, or even cooling [4]. During this period, the IPCC high, low, and ‘best’ estimate all were higher than what was observed. Using AGW theory, this was not predictable. However, believing that oceanic cycles [5], or the sun [6], caused significant warming in the last 100 years, this change in temperature is wholly reasonable. Therefore, at least for the last decade, the natural causes of climate change correlate better than the anthropogenic ones.   Another very important prediction is the existence of a tropospheric hotspot. Models significantly overestimate the tropospheric hotspot. When you look at the actual data, there has been minimal warming in the troposphere [8]. Further, on nearly every altitude, the actual data show the atmosphere significantly cooler than predicted [12].   3. Possible Natural Causes  The natural cause I will be supporting in this debate is the solar cause. The sun causing climate change makes sense: it is the sole source of heat on this planet, the other sources have either unknown causes or merely amplify the suns effect. The sun, however, directly and indirectly causes climate change.   The length of the solar cycle has been correlated to temperature throughout the 20th century. Direct sunlight, cosmic rays, magnetic fields, short and long term solar cycles, all easily explain--and contribute--to climate change [7]. As geologist Bob Carter notes, “the argument advanced by the IPCC… [that] the sun cannot play a major role in global warming or cooling trends--is incorrect.”[8] Recent research by Willie Soon and David Legates, using new and improved TSI (total solar irradiance) measuring techniques definitively conclude that the sun causes the majority of recent climate change. Further, they correct their previous research, and answer the ‘missing link’ question which was formulated in Soon, 2009. Their conclusion states that there exists strong evidence of a solar to climate relationship, and argues that models need to include the possibility of a strong solar forcing [9]. A summary of recent research argues that “[t]he Sun may have contributed as much as 66% of  the observed twentieth century warming, and perhaps more. … IPCC models do not incorporate important solar  factors such as fluctuations in magnetic intensity  and overestimate the role of human-related CO2 forcing.”[10]  However, I have mainly been talking about TSI, which does cause a significant amount of climate change. Other, more indirect, sources of energy from the sun do cause climate change. The most well known of these is the cosmic ray hypothesis. Cosmic rays cause climate change through cloud formation. How do cosmic rays cause cloud formation?  Cosmic rays come in from outer space. TSI alone cannot explain warming throughout all of history, it is commonly accepted that it needs a modifier, so, how do cosmic rays modify the sun’s rays? As these rays hit earth, they are something which molecules use to create clouds. The correlation between cloud formation and cosmic rays is clear. The more cosmic rays, the more clouds, clouds as a negative feedback cool the earth, therefore more cosmic rays = cooler earth. The fewer cosmic rays, the fewer clouds, and a warmer earth. So, lets examine this theory. As the sun is more active, a stronger solar wind exists and pushes the rays away, reducing the amount of cosmic rays--a warmer earth. As the sun cools down, the less wind, a cooler earth. Let’s examine this theory [11]:  1) Cosmic rays cause cloud formation: Significant evidence exists of the cosmic ray-cloud formation link. According to research in the early 21st century, there exists a close correlation between cosmic rays and cloud formation. The more rays, the more clouds. Cosmic rays, therefore, are related to cloud formation.  2) Cosmic ray-temperature correlation: On a geologic timescale, there is a very strong correlation between cosmic rays and temperature. During the phanerozoic, there exists a near perfect correlation between cosmic rays and temperature.   3) Clouds serve as a negative feedback: Clouds need to be a negative feedback in order for this theory to be strong. The data on sensitivity above already agree with this assertion. Clouds, which is one of the largest feedbacks, is primarily negative.   So, to summarize, cosmic rays cause cloud formation, cosmic rays correlate to temperature, clouds have decreased, clouds are a negative feedback which means more cosmic rays cool the earth, and fewer warm it. Cosmic rays are a viable candidate in the search for a cause for climate change.   Conclusion:  Based on the failure to predict phenomena, low climate sensitivity making it nearly impossible for CO2 to have a significant warming effect, and strong evidence for a solar link contributing to the majority of recent warming, I see it unlikely that AGW theory is correct. Climate change happens, whether we want it to or not. The climate is changing, and humans are affecting it, but our influence is negligible when compared to strong natural factors. </h>

    <t>1. Greenhouse effect No one denies, let alone disputes, that the greenhouse effect exists and keeps the warm much warmer. What is under dispute is how much of the greenhouse effect, related to human emissions, causes climate change. My opponent keeps claiming that the effect of this is significant, but as I have shown, this is not the case. I have provided multiple studies which refute climate alarmism: high climate sensitivity. About half of the greenhouse effect which alarmists are worried about is due to clouds. If this is not the case, human induced climate change is extremely small. Observational evidence contradicts the positive feedback cloud assumption that the IPCC and others assume, making it very unlikely that greenhouse gasses have caused significant warming in the 20th century [1]. Further, if the climate was so sensitive to CO2, we would see this correlation  in the geologic record. However, when you look at the record, CO2 either shows no correlation or lags temperature increases. If CO2 was a large driver of climate, we would not see no correlation in the data. There have been periods where it is extremely warm with little CO2, and periods where it is cold with a high amount of CO2. But how do we know that CO2 is not a significant part of the greenhouse effect? Simple, actually. Even using IPCC estimates, human emissions only account for 0.45% of the greenhouse warming in a particular year, which means humans have only contributed to 0.1 degrees C of warming in the 20th century, or about 1/7th. To put it in other words, 99.55% of the greenhouse effect has nothing to do with human carbon emissions. How, then, could CO2, without significant positive feedback (which my opponent has not proven) cause global climate change? The fact is, sensitivity is extremely low in relation to CO2, and therefore humans have a very insignificant impact on global warming [2].  Further, her argument as to how strong the greenhouse effect is--which is correct--focuses on the wrong gas. In fact, water vapor, not CO2 or other man-produced emissions are the largest cause of the greenhouse effect. Further, the vast majority of all of these gasses is not man made. My opponent claims feedbacks are positive, but this is unlikely the case. Clouds, the largest feedback mechanism we know of, decreases the amount of radiation which hits the earths surface, which means that as CO2 causes more clouds (based on AGW theory), the feedback is negative, which often cancels out the warming from greenhouse gasses. Strong evidence suggests that, '[n]et feedbacks in the real climate system — on both short and long time scales — are probably negative.'[3]To argue that the climate system is insensitive to CO2 does not claim that the climate is not sensitive to anything. If specific feedbacks caused by CO2 is negative that does not mean the climate will remain in stasis or cooling. Clouds, a negative feedback, actually support the cosmic ray theory--which my opponent has ignored. The clouds in the case of CO2 will cause cooling, however, cosmic rays create clouds. If the sun is more active, fewer cosmic rays reach earth, and reduce cloud cover. Reduced cloud cover means a lower albedo, which leads to warming. In fact, the climate system is very sensitive to fluctuations of cosmic rays, and cosmic rays are a viable canidate for the majority of the recent warming [4]. AGW theory claims that the decrease in cloud cover is caused by the small warming from CO2, which means more light hits the surface, and more warming. However, they are confusing cause and effect. How do they know that warming caused the clouds to decrease, and not vice-versa? Do clouds cause temperature change, or does temperature change cause clouds? Observational evidence supports the first: clouds cause temperature change. This means that it is a negative feedback in the case of CO2, and a positive one in the case of a cosmic ray flux. Research has demonstrated that the climate is very sensitive to changes in cosmic rays, which amplifies the solar effect greatly [5]. The graph my opponent has is from the IPCC 2007 report, it attempts to display the different causes of climate change by demonstrating how sensitive the climate is to each forcing, and, therefore, how much of the recent warming was caused by each forcing. However, this graph is based on models which have failed to reproduce observed data. They cannot explain the pause in warming, they describe feedbacks (see clouds) incorrectly, their sensitivity is off, their predictions so far are off, they fail to incorporate cosmic ray flux and other natural forcings, etc. The graph only takes into account irradience. But ignores... Magnetic fields, Earth rotation, cosmic rays, and 1500 year cycles. The argument that solar forcings only affect climae through irradience, or that the sun has little effect, is not supported by the facts [6]. The graph underestimates the effect of clouds which is likely significant, and overestimates the effect from CO2. Further, the graph ignores things humans do to cool the climate (aerosols, for example). 2. Added emissionsDroughts always happen, crops aren't dying they're thriving, and if the third world were to develop proper government systems they would be able to clean the water sources and increase the amount of usable water. The GMO argument proves my point... If climate change is real and we are affected, humans will adopt technologies to support our society, increase efficiency, and feed the world. I don't see how that is a negative! Further, as I argued with other empirical evidence, increased CO2 will benefit agriculture and reduce the strains which we have currently put on it. Recent increasing crop yields occured regardless of GMO's. The first GMO crop was tested in 1986, and the first tests in America began in 1987 [7]. Therefore it is safe to assume GMO's were not used in crops until the late 1980s or early 1990s. Crop yields have been increasing since at least 1960, and after the introduction of GMO's I dont see a faster increase in crop yields [8]. The fact is, warming will increase agriculture and reduce deaths. Warming, as demonstrated by observations not models, actually increases precipitation and reduces the water crisis--helping crops. Efforts to reduce emissions would actually harm people around the world, not help them [9]. Dropped argumentsMy opponent has dropped all of my arguments regarding a natural cause. The more caused by nature, the less caused by humans. If nature as I demonstrated has the power to warm the world significantly, and as I demonstrated is a very viable suspect in the cause of warming, AGW theory is thrown out the window. Further, AGW's predictions fail. The true mark of a theory is without doubt its ability to predict phenomena.– Science and Hebrew Tradition, “On the Method of Zadig,” p. 20 [10]. AGW failed to predict the warming pause since 1997, cooling since 2001, and all models predict too much warming. If AGW theory cannot predict what has happened, that means the conclusion is false, and should be revised. The fact that it hasn't isnt science, its turned into politics. ConclusionAGW theory fails on all accounts. Humans play a very negligible role in global warming. Feedbacks are negative, natural causes much better explain the recent warming, AGW has made false predictions, the pause weakens the case for AGW, and the tropospheric hotspot is gone, it doesn't exist. The fact is, the scientific case for AGW is non-existent. Vote CON1. Roy Spencer.

    <t>1. Greenhouse EffectThe argument that you seem to consistently use argues largely against the idea that the majority of the greenhouse effect is caused by water vapor. That, I do not dispute. The issue is not whether or not the greenhouse effect's human contributions cause warmth, but whether they cause active warming. The greenhouse effect has been around since practically the beginning of time on Earth. Therefore the Earth remains largely stagnant in it's temperature; or else, it should. While most of the warmth on Earth from the greenhouse effect comes from water vapor, the same is not true for the warming of the Earth. You previously stated that you attributed warmth to sun flares; 'The natural cause I will be supporting in this debate is the solar cause.' [1]. I previously cited a source that reliably stated that the climate was actually more sensitive towards CO2 due to positive feedbacks than it was towards solar causes. [2] Many sources cite positive feedback trends, and this graph too supports the thought, in demonstrating that as time has gone on, and CO2 has become more prominent in the atmosphere, the temperature of the ocean has risen in response to feedbacks, which are largely caused by the ocean. [3]  'Climate feedbacks are processes that change as a result of a change in forcing, and cause additional climate change. An example of this is the 'ice-albedo feedback.' As the atmosphere warms, sea ice will melt. Ice is highly reflective, while the underlying ocean surface is far less reflective. The darker ocean will absorb more heat, getting warmer and making the Earth warmer overall. A feedback that increases an initial warming is called a 'positive feedback.' A feedback that reduces an initial warming is a 'negative feedback.' The ice-albedo feedback is a very strong positive feedback that has been included in climate models since the 1970s.' [3]  As for no evidence of CO2 causing warmer temperatures...   In fact, as CO2 in the atmosphere becomes more prominent, clouds form more slowly and less. [4]When the climate is highly sensitive to CO2, that is precisely what you are arguing. The IPCC has released a report regarding the inaccuracey of their predictions. It states several reasons why climate change is so unpredictable, and therefore possible reasons for why they were wrongs; forcing agents applied to the climate, geographical and vertical distributions, nature, the magnitude of feedbacks, and the mean climate state, among other things [5]. As these things are not solidly predictable, it's not exactly rocket science. It's a bit like the local news weather anchors, you see. 2. Added emissions True, true due to Monsanto amp; friends, and agreed. I hope we can also agree that they don't need the government's help. I personally believe it is, and that we will be drastically affected. I, simply put, do see how that is negative. There are certain things. I spent the entire day today sitting in my garden on a lawn chair, reading, drinking tea, and watering my plants. I spend the summer hiking, swimming, running through the woods. I take naps on a broken generator in the middle of my raspberry patch, surrounded by lilacs swooning over the blooming patch watching bright blue Colorado sky. Call me crazy, but I have no intention to deny the future generations this leisure. It may make it easier, it may increase our efficiency, but really, are we creating a world that you WANT to live in with that? I think that would be a world closer to F451, a haunting book that hits too close to home. Dropped Arguments Sorry, I guess I did. I sort of created my own arguments on the grounds that your argument didn't really affect my argument. I have absolutely no doubt that natural causes do contribute to climate changes in a sense, and do certainly speed it up, but they are not as pronounced as human changes. According to this, the natural changes would have created a much cooler environment than we are experiencing at the moment :    Failure to predict something doesn't make the theory wrong in all counts. Saying that the weather man got something wrong doesn't make meterology completely false. Conclusion Anthropogenic global warming is a case supported by 97% [6] of scientists, and by all reasonable accounts. My evidence has demonstrated positive feedbacks, and poor supports for natural causes. Several false predictions do not discount an entire, nearly universally accepted theory; nearly as true as evolution. AGW is a completely valid and most definitely true scientific phenomenon.</t>

    <t>1. Greenhouse effect   The greenhouse exists and contributes to some of the warming, that fact is not debated. However, the significance of this effect is.   The fact is, the direct effect from man-made gases cannot, alone, cause climate change. In order to come with the estimates of human induced climate change positive feedback mechanisms must exist. If the response is neutral, or negative, it is very unlikely that added greenhouse gases from man have a significant effect. If there are no feedbacks--an insensitive climate, “this means that the extra carbon dioxide we pump into the atmosphere is not enough to cause the observed warming over the last 100 years”[1].   So, as argued in my sensitivity argument, the debate is not whether or not there is some impact of CO2, it is not whether or not the greenhouse effect exists, it is a question of feedbacks. If my opponent cannot demonstrate a sensitive climate system, the primary mechanism for AGW theory--the direct effect being amplified to a significant level--AGW is impossible.   Research  indicates either a system with few positive feedbacks or negative ones. A study in the journal Climate Research found that climate sensitivity was only 1.8 degrees C, and could possibly be lower [2]. New research done in 2012 found a median sensitivity of 1.1 degrees C [3], which replicates a study published in Energy and Environment in 2009 [4]. The researchers in Eamp;E claimed that their evidence demonstrated a no feedback climate system with carbon dioxide. Research in 2009 and 2011 in Asia-Pacific Journal of Atmospheric Science demonstrated negative feedbacks, with mean climate sensitivity of 0.7 degrees C [5]. Assuming negative climate feedbacks, the greenhouse effect is only responsible for one third of the warming since 1979, which is a crippling blow to the theory of AGW [6].   2. Causes of emissions   I have little doubt that the recent CO2 emissions are in fact caused by man. Although there is some doubt to this theory [7], I find the doubt not convincing. However, believing that CO2 is mainly emitted by man is not endangering the arguments I have made above.   3. Effects of added emissions   Other than the temperature predictions my opponent claims (and 1.5 as the lower estimate, if true, would actually refute AGW, this is why alarmists generally choose 2-3 degrees C), this section is irrelevant. The temperature predictions are already refuted under my extensive climate sensitivity argument and rebuttal.   But I will refute her other arguments just for fun.   The argument we are running out of water is false. The oceans create water through evaporation every day, and rain gives us enough fresh water every day for a decade. The reason we are ‘running out of water’ is because it is not raining in our reservoirs. Our cities are placed where it rained 100 years ago, which has temporarily made a ‘crisis’. But this is treated by merely shipping the water. The costs of water may increase, but is it not going to run out or be catastrophic. And as the weather changes, as will the rain, meaning certain areas will gain water others will lose it. Further, all coastal settlements, if they actually did run out of water, could merely filter ocean water. The vast majority of sea level rise will not affect food production. Satellite data shows although some regions have seen sea level rise, globally, the trend is insignificant and in many areas nonexistent [8].   The fact GMO’s are keeping food production normal is actually an argument against alarm. It demonstrated that new technology will cause us to adapt and mitigate any plausible damages from climate change. As the world changes, humans adapt, and make up for the change. Her argument really shows us how brilliant humans are, really. However, research dispels the myth of falling food production. In fact, CO2 and crop yields correlate almost perfectly: more CO2, more crop yields--this is even including the period before GMO’s. And research shows crop yields should be expected to increase as emissions and temperature increases. Rice, depending on the genotype, increases yields from 2-180% at 570 ppm. In areas where agriculture has overused the land, research shows CO2 enrichment can increase plant growth and counter the lack of nitrogen and phosphorus in the soil. And in the case of drought, more CO2 increases plant efficiency and reduces the need for water [9]. These facts show that increases CO2 and temperature will benefit the planet, not harm it.</t>

    <t>1. Greenhouse Effect In the past 100 years, as this graph quite clearly illustrates, CO2 has at least doubled.The impact of that was previously illustrated, as being between 1.5 to 4.5 degrees C. As the temperature in the past 100 years has risen 1.53 degrees F, clearly that sort of impact is completely possible.I will now explain why.The climate is very sensitive to greenhouse gases, contrary to my opponent's argument. Without greenhouse gases, it is speculated that the earth would freeze. [1] Until the last couple of hundred years, anthropogenic global warming was obsolete; everything was simply climate.Without taking into account feedbacks, the warming would be around 1.25 degrees C. [2]Once feedback is taken into account, it then rises to the now three times stated 1.5 to 4.5 degrees C. Feedback is basically saying that as the Earth warms, the Earth (namely the ocean) absorbs the warmth, thereby keeping the Earth in a cycle of warmth, by releasing more heat into the atmosphere [3] Therefore, even if the effect of greenhouse gases are minimal, at only around 1 degree C, the effect that those subsequent feedbacks have, and then the warmth thereby warming the Earth again creating more feedback, is quite dramatic. [3]By arguing that the climate is insensitive to CO2, you thereby argue that the climate, in and of itself, is insensitive. This would make it insensitive to what you argue that it IS sensitive towards; such as the solar irradiance, volcanoes, etc.. While the Earth is not as sensitive as sometimes brought up to be, everything is as obsolete in changing the Earth's temperature as you claim CO2 is. This figure basically says that the Earth is more sensitive to CO2 than it is to solar instances. I know it's ridiculously hard to read, and to be honest, I have been staring at it for about 15 minutes, and still barely understand it, but that is what it says [4]. It is also hard to argue climate sensitivity at the level you seem to be inferring towards, when you look at past instances. On average, the temperature changes 6 degrees C through each interglacial period, which is tough to explain when arguing that the climate is insensitive. [4]2. Causes of EmissionsI would concur. 3. Effects of Added Emmisons Perhaps running out of water was a bad choice of words. I would have more aptly said 'experiencing water shortages', as 'running out of water' implies that water is leaving our Earth, which of course, is impossible except for the water taken to space by astronauts, which is negliible, and rock colliding into other rock, which happens at an obscenely low level. I therefore won't attempt to refute your refution, because it's entirely valid. I will defend my re-iteration of my statement quite briefly. Droughts have riddled our country [5] and many others, especially hurting vegetation prices in the U.S.A.. [6] Many crops are dying all around the globe, as stated, and we are experiencing a global crisis of getting people in 3rd world legitimate water. [7]I would rather we not get into an argument about GMOs. This is not the topic of the debate, and frankly, one side thinks the other is paranoid, while on the other side thinks the first side is apathetic towards overwhelming evidence. While quite simply, CO2 = more crops, on a more intense level, it only would do so for a backyard garden or irrigated crops. The warming from CO2 is causing droughts, thereby causing, admittedly slightly lower crop productions for non-GMOs. As I said, crop production is NOT falling, however, the only reason it hasn't gone down about 5% is because of GMOs, which have taken it up around 30%. [8] Severe drought won't help a plant, it will kill it, though I will admit that GMOs and more CO2 will decrease water need (though not to the point where a literal lack of water would not harm it at all).</t>

    <t>I will argue that CO2 is the largest contribution to global warming, at 72% [1] of greenhouse gas emissions, and that greenhouse gas emissions are a major contributor to global warming. 1. The Greenhouse EffectNearly all of the temperature increase observed in the past 50 years is due to a rapid increase in greenhouse gases [2] that cause a phenomenon called 'the greenhouse effect'. When sunlight reaches the Earth, a small proportion of it is absorbed into the Earth, and subsequently the Earth is warmed. Most of the sun rays reverberate back into the atmosphere, and usually back out into space. Greenhouse gases, such as methane, CO2, and nitrous oxide absorb some of the sun rays as they go back out into space. As a result, the atmosphere is warmed, and subsequently, the Earth. Much of the cause of the greenhouse effect is water vapor, such as clouds. [3]This is not a part of global warming, however, because ever since water existed on planet Earth, this water vapor has been present, and therefore, while it contributes to the warmth of the Earth, does not contribute to the rise in the Earth's temperature, which in the past 100 years, has gone up about 1.53 F [4]. 2. Causes of EmissionsThe majority of emissions is CO2, as was previously stated to be at 72%. Then comes methane, at 18%, and nitrous oxide at 7%. The remaining 3% is other assorted emissions that are not particularly important in this debate. The biggest causes of the emissions are : [5]- transportation fuels, (14.0%). This is indubitably an anthropogenic cause of global warming. If humans were to cease to exist, which, according to recent studies, seems increasingly likely, emissions due to transportation (planes, boats, cars, etc..) would stop going into the atmosphere, making this cause anthropogenic. - agricultural byproducts (12.5%). This is a largely anthropogenic issue. Obviously if humans went extinct, plants would go on growing, but the issue here is not the growth of plants. It is fertilizer, the amount we have to water, the waste of the obscene amount of food we throw away, etc.. Therefore this cause is anthropogenic. - industrial processes (16.8%). Since this would no longer be an issue without humans, this is anthropogenic. - power stations (21.3%). Again a clearly anthropogenic cause. - residential and commercial sources (10.3%) Will cease to exist when we do.There are many more, but this is over 50%, so I don't see my listing any more as useful. 3. What kind of effect does a rise in CO2 have? You brought up that CO2, as more of it goes into the atmosphere, becomes less potent. Indeed, for every time the amount of CO2 in our atmosphere doubles, the temperature will rise the same amount, no matter how much more CO2 is going into our atmosphere. Estimates state that this rise would be 1.5 to 4.5 C [6]. The effects of this would be massive. Already, with the 1.53 F rise that is already in place, we are seeing a drastic rise in sea levels, ice melting worldwide at rates and amounts bigger than ever predicted, some of which we can never regain, less fresh water is becoming available, the only reason our crop production isn't falling is because of GMOs, etc.. [7] These effects will be much worse the more our CO2 amount rises. An estimate says that even if we limit warming to 2 C, water levels will most likely rise by several meters.</t>

Therefore, Capitalism cannot be automatically immoral strictly because of the environment - as we see the same environmental issues within completely different economic systems.Environmental Crux: Is there a more moral, more ethical, more environmentally friendly way to be capitalistic?

However, I don't think it prudent to clearly demonstrate Capitalism as amoral - in which the system itself (Capitalism) cannot be concerned with rightness or wrongness as it is a system used by people - but then use the argument of Utility to try and argue Capitalism as moral - that would be philosophically illogical as it would be a contradiction.

Pro only uses 3 or 4 in the same rounds with a total of 11 - A DIFFERENCE OF 7! - and then Pro asks the voting populace to only critic Con's cited sources.It's true, the quality of the source is important - BUT - if two cites were deducted from Con for each cited round, Con would still finish with more cites/sources of equal quality - still.Let's keep in mind cites are not just for source references when presenting a thesis but also to protect intellectual property and to prevent plagiarisms.Issue of Communist ArgumentsThere was no endorsement or argument made for/of Communism or Marxism whatsoever! Communism and Marxism was only mentioned for contrast of economic systems and to illustrate points regarding Capitalism and the environment! The contrast of economic systems was needed to show Pro that the reasons he gave for the immorality of Capitalism are also observed in 'other' economies and, thusly, simply weren't good enough reasons for his case.Working Class (voters may disregard)Capitalism lifts general populations out of poverty. So, though we can talk about Class Warfare, child-labour in the past, and social-economic injustices, in general, the greater population is served (world wide), which was demonstrated through Utility.This is why data(s) for global Gross National Incomes (GNI) and the Human Development Index (HDI) were introduced by Con.Simply put, the individual worker is part of a system which benefits the whole.CONCLUSION:Like an inanimate object - Capitalism is not 'conscious' of it's morality or not. Capitalism is an economic system - which is used by people - in which the system itself is incapable of being immoral or moral. Rather, it depends how it is used by the people using it. Hence, Capitalism as an economic system is AMORAL - and as such cannot be immoral.Con will not try to appeal or try to sway the voting populace in final remarks but simply requests that Debate.org's voting guidelines be followed.Many thanks!</t>
<h>    Alex, it's been a pleasure!Well done fine Sir!Thank you for the debate, I enjoyed it!I was saving Round 5 to address the the Working Class directly - however - I don't think it would be fair as Pro would be unable to respond.</h>

    <t>A well written reply. Now it has come to closing statement. I will introduce no new evidence as I feel is proper for Round 5. Con is in no way obligated to follow suit. It will be concise and name reasons for to vote Pro. Closing Statement It has been quite a debate however there are numerous reasons on which Pro has carried the day. These are outlined below:  Firstly I would like to cite the lack of Con demonstrating the morality of Capitalism. In round 2 I explained in detail that morality is determined via cost benefit analysis. I went on to use data which supports that Capitalism has a greater cost than benefit and therefore must be rendered immoral. Con never introduced a method to determining morality nor did he apply the data he found to an expressed moral system. Even if one assumes Con operates under the cost-benefit model which I articulated, he never once named it or explained how his points can be found as amoral or moral through cost-benefit analysis. Beyond that he claims that all he has to do is show that capitalism is amoral rather than immoral to win the debate. This is true, but Con fails to do so, he introduces data and fails to provide analysis. On these facts alone I believe you, the voters, ought to vote pro.  Secondly my opponent dropped my contention on exploitation of workers, while he says he would address it in later rounds he has yet to do so. Therefore in the lack of a rebuttal one ought to vote Pro as I have fielded arguments.   Thirdly there is the matter of sources, In the arguments for the resolution academics are frequently cited and reputable sources can be found in at the of my arguments in rounds 2, 3, and 4. Con on the other hand has cited wikipedia, about.com, and slideshare. Thus I urge you to vote pro as you may put more faith in the accuracy of the sources.  Fourthly and finally one ought to vote Pro on topicality. Con strayed from the resolution and forwarded arguments in regard to communism. The arguments for Pro always link back to the resolution and only target points actually made by Con. Con on the other hand constructed a few red herrings and on more than one occasion veered from the resolution. I urge all voters to read the arguments carefully and if one discovers this assertion to be true then they must vote Pro.  Thank you for the debate and thank you for voting ~Alex</t>

    <t>Alex, nice work!I like the counterpoint ideas.The discussion is shaping up!Historical Narrative:Again, the historical narrative is invaluable here for perspective -- but let's go a little further back this time and then fast-forward to Marx: In a natural state plants and animals are inherent 'consumers' -- requiring energy and resources. It is the biological and ecological - Tao - way things are. We are governed by the Laws of Thermodynamics and there is no way of escaping this. We have to consume life of some kind (plant or animal, vice-versa) to survive. We need to build shelter(s). We need to stay warm. We need to secure resources to do these things.I wish it were different. I wish the environment and the species in it were 100% safe -- and the world and every living being lived in a happy utopia -- safe from me when I need to eat or shelter my body from the elements -- but I'm sorry -- I will destroy a tree in order to build a shelter or make a fire while out foraging for some endangered species to eat so I don't starve! HA! And I'm sure you would do the same! You could decide to eat nothing but some berries maybe in the hopes of minimizing the suffering of the little creatures, but, since meat has a higher caloric-value, in a survival situation, I wouldn't be mad at ya if you did eat the little forest dwellers, which are busy consuming to survive as we are. It's the Circle of Life my friend [Lion King, Disney]. --Least I point out you are still consuming the berries and effecting the environment and rest of the ecosystem! Now, besides being somewhat off-point and silly, the reason I bring up these ideas is because even Marx recognized this. Humans are social animals who often benefit from performing these basic survival functions together -- coming up with better and more efficient ways -- requiring less energy and resources to secure more, etc. As you pointed out in your first argument, 'Capitalism is without a doubt the most productive economic system ever created.' Marx, whose orientation was largely materialist and historicist (influenced by conditions and inherent processes beyond the control of humans), framed his analysis around four central points: 1) the physical reality of people, 2) the organization of social relations, 3) the value of the historical context of development, and 4) the human nature of continuous praxis [anthropology.ua.edu/cultures/cultures] (Marx had to study history to locate an original accumulation as an external starting point of capital -- which is an interesting point I hope we will have time to get back to in later rounds).But let me ask you a series of questions for contrast and to elucidate a point further: Did communist groups throughout history ever cut down trees in excess and accumulate a resource-surplus? Did communists ever destroy environments or species to secure these resources? Do you think communists ever produced undesirable pollutants that were expelled in the environment in order to manufacture goods or products, regardless of how they held class systems or distributed and created wealth or prosperity?If the answer is YES to these questions, you might want to consider Capitalism, as a system, is equally used by people -- like other systems even though different -- capable of being misused, abandoned, and abused to excess. Your N. Korea example is to this point; as is the spousal-cheating example. We can agree to whatever, BUT if we don't stick to the original agreement then we have violated what it was we originally agreed to. You said: 'My “beef” with Capitalism is very much so rooted in the modern capitalist system, the moral repugnance of this model is grounded in the modern realities not theoretical possibilities.' So we actually agree.But, again, it's like when folks say, 'money is evil,' when someone else might disagree and point out that it depends how money is actually used. Again, the problem isn't Capitalism.The problem is how we have chosen to be capitalistic or use Capitalism. According to what you're saying, I should then judge Marxism or Communism only by the fall of the Soviet Union! Or should I still consider variations of Marxism or Communism that might still be successful?Historic Challenge Rebuttal -- provide a historical example of Capitalism devoid of “human greed, consumerism, imperialism, overpopulation, rapid industrialization, and the institutionalization of currency and money-lending. I can't speak of the greed in one's heart but here are a couple of good examples:1) 'A strong market economy was a very important aspect of Meoamerican cultures. Although much of our information about the market economy in Mesoamerica comes primarily from the Aztec/Mexica world during the Late Postclassic, there is clear evidence that markets played a major role throughout Mesoamerica in the diffusion of goods at least as recently as the Classic period. Beginning during the Classic Period (AD 250-800/900), merchants supported urban specialists with raw materials and finished goods to convert into luxury goods and exportable items for trade'. 2) 'One interesting feature of Native American money is how something which seems to have relatively little value beyond the context of Native American life and culture can in the end become quite valuable. For instance, many Indians in North America used wampum for Native American money. Wampum consists of clam shells and was initially used by coastal tribes, until the use of wampum spread throughout the continent and was store by the Iroquois, which was one of the most prosperous and powerful tribes. Although many settlers scoffed at Native American currency in the beginning, wampum was later used by many colonists as a form of currency. For instance, Peter Stuyvesant paid his workers in wampum when they constructed the New York citadel. The island of Manhattan was purchased for wampum. Wampum was used as the main form of Native American Money because it had value as a decorative item, and many Native Americans pierced holes at the top of their wampum and wore them in a belt rather than carrying wampum in a bag' [indians.org/articles/native-american-money].Green Capitalism amp; China Rebuttal:Bear in mind 'going green' is a relatively new occurrence -- even in the US! It's going to take some time. Sure, with globalization there are other countries jumping on the bandwagon, wanting to produce and manufacture goods and create wealth in the same kind of ways the US did -- unfortunately following in many of our same footsteps and making some of the same mistakes. And for them the pros might out-weight the cons financially -- though you and I would both agree not environmentally.But it's interesting to note that this week in national news: 1) John Kerry in China -- “A unique co-operative effort” with China on the issue of combating climate change' [theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/15/john-kerry-china].2) 'John Kerry Calls Climate Change a 'Weapon of Mass Destruction'. Note the most capitalistic nation's Secretary of State is visiting China and working on these issues. Again, Civilization is now reacting to a new perspective and trying to understand and find it's environmental equilibrium while maintaining it's livelihood.Philanthropy Rebuttal:Con never asserted Corporate philanthropy is 'enough' -- but will in later rounds demonstrate capitalistic societies have and do 'give' more when presenting utility and addressing the Working Class.</t>

    <t>1. Capitalism destroys the environment.Capitalism is without a doubt the most productive economic system ever created. Capitalism, throughout history, has required an ever increasing level of natural resources to sustain itself. To quote Abramsky, Fellow at the Institute of Advanced Studies in Science, Technology and Society: ' The current worldwide system of production is based on endless growth and expansion, which is simply incompatible with a long term reduction in emissions and energy consumption. Despite the fact that localized and punctual moments of reduction may well still occur, the overall energy consumption and emissions of the system as a whole can only increase[1].'Thus Capitalism is unable to break free from the status quo of industrialization and environmental pollution. In fact it has only to contribute to the crisis. So what then are the impacts of status quo 'worldwide system of production' on the environment?A. Climate change at this point has considerable evidence to support Anthropogenic involvement. Indeed one can no longer claim, with any basis in scientific fact, that climate change is a purely natural event, outside of human agency. The following chart is provided by the OSS Foundation:  The impacts of climate change on biodiversity are unparalleled by any other disaster in recorded history. A wide variety of projections have been made by experts on the topic: The Nature Conservancy claims as much as 1/4 of ALL species on earth are at risk for extinction[2]. Depending on the projection used these figures range as high as 80/70% and as low as gt;10%. Regardless of the model used, I challenge Con and the voters to find a model supported by mainstream science that which concludes biodiversity is affected by climate change.B. further evidence of the negative impact of the industrialized capitalist era can be found in deforestation trends. E.O. Wilson, Harvard sociobiologist, in The Future of life posits that a sharp increase in Global deforestation occurred around 1852(during the industrialization of Capitalist Europe and America in the 1800's). By his estimates, 80% of All old growth forests will be wiped out. This is without a doubt human agency and the data supports that the capitalist system has deeply worsened this trend. I doubt severely that tribal collectivists and other groups outside of the capitalist system were responsible for this sharp change. Here is a chart that shows US old growth forests from the 'Atlas of the Historical Geography of the United States':  Unless Con wishes to contest that this was indeed not the result of Capitalism in America, but rather natural phenomena or the actions of tribal Native Americans then we must conclude that rapid global deforestation is the result of the Capitalist system.Why the destruction of the environment is a moral matter is simple. In fact it can be rendered morally repugnant in numerous models of morality, I will outline 2.~Species rights: Genocide, the intentional wiping out of ethnic groups is outlawed by international law and near universally condemned. What then gives the right, nor the ethical reasoning to intentionally exploit and wipe out the rest of the animal kingdom? This is totally unacceptable. Does one not treat ethically their pets? Yet on what grounds can we advocate for the intentional genocide on thousands of species. The degree to which Capitalism has exploited and wiped out plants/animals indicates a system of true moral repugnance.~'Stewards of Creation' To those voters who posses morality based on the Abrahamic religions and believe in a god given superiority of animals, I would like to point out that nature is creation. Therefor the destruction of the natural world for profit, is the very apex of Man's arrogance to God. Thus you must vote in accord with Capitalism as an immoral economic system.2. Capitalism exploits WorkersExploitation: The action or fact of treating someone unfairly in order to benefit from their work.All born into this world are free, yet most of us grew up in chains, as the Jacobin once posited.All property(with few exceptions) is owned by either a nation state or private individual in the Capitalist system. Meaning that all resources are owned, as well as the means in which to produce them. Those who have private control over the means of production, are in a naturally exploitative relationship over those who lack it. Consider I played the capitalist game right and now I - along with others like me- own the vast majority of the wealth(capital) and property. Now Con is born into this world, he graduates high school and is now a member of the working class. Now he gets to enter the world of the voluntary free market! He really has two choices: work for a private corporation -like mine- or be without the ability to produce(mooch, vagabond, starvation). If all the property is owned and all the resources within them, and additionally the means to produce material goods(factories, farms, bakeries, etc) then how may Con opt out?He really cannot, this is where the exploitation really begins. But lets zoom out, as those of us in WEIRD (Western Educated Industrialized Rich Democratic) nations do not do much of the producing. Therefor the conditions of labor in which he is subjected to, which are still exploitative is nothing near what the capitalist system does to labor involved in production. CIA World Factbook 2006 via Stephen Morley Green=Industry Blue=Service. I want to point out that all nation states with the exception of Laos, Cuba and arguably North Korea operate within the confines of a capitalist market economy.Let us consider the following thought experiment, based on the 'Original Position' of Oxford Fellow John Rawls. The purpose of this thought experiment is to determine what in a society is just and what is unjust:We have been tasked with determining a new society for humanity to live in and then we shall be born into this new world. But there is a catch: You will not get to choose your gender, economic standing, ethnicity or kin. You may be anyone.You would naturally want, at least for yourself, guarantee of adequate living conditions and the access to earn a living wage. If one posits that they would like to be born into a society with the two aforementioned attributes then Capitalism is most definitely the system you do not wish to pursue.To quote Professor James Davies 'Income inequality has been rising for the past 20 to 25 years and we think that is true for inequality in the distribution of wealth.[3]'Additionally the same article yields:' the richest 1 percent of adults - most of whom live in Europe or the United States - owned 40 percent of global assets.'Meaning that the world capitalist system is one of massive, and polarizing inequity.To frame this another way, under the social contract of Capitalism, you may be born into a family-not to mention region- with little capital and thus forced to labor and produce for society. Others in this socio-economic system inherit the means of production and a far greater level of capital. They can and will profit of your labor.J. Greene of Harvard found in a study that human beings make moral choices via cost-benefit analysis[4].Capitalism bears billions into this world with minute capital and the few profit off these impoverished masses.The benefit off the few are outweighed by the suffering of the many.Capitalism is immoral.Now I shall turn it over to Con, I await his opening statement with anticipation.~Alex1.

    <t>Well said! I like the ideas and the graphics! Nice work!  The reason I accepted this debate is precisely because there is a hidden premise lurking here -- and you have presented it in your arguments in grandiose fashion! I think this should be a great discussion!  The hidden premise you have put forward is this: Capitalism itself is inherently immoral -- or, at the very least, is an economic system which automatically leads to the inevitable consequences of 1) destroying the environment and 2) mistreating a working class -- which is simply not true. It is false.  The historical narrative is invaluable here for perspective. For example, in his Two Treatises of Government, John Locke (considered to be one of the founding architects of modern Capitalism) outlined 'rules' for being capitalistic, specifically 'limits to accumulation'. Also important was the concept of securing and setting value and how property should be defined.  Locke rightly recognized that the human element of greed could transform Capitalism into an economic system which could be abused or misused to extreme excess. A 'check and balance' set of ideas was put forward. Locke is very clear that even in a natural state of plenty:  1) There must be enough for others 2) One can use natural resources as long as it isn't stolen or taken from others 3) Natural resources can be used as long as what is taken, is replaced and doesn't spoil [Second Treatise, Sec. 85]  Do we follow guidelines like these today? No, absolutely not. There is a strident difference between John Locke's fundamental 'rules' for being capitalistic -- producing goods and creating property and wealth -- compared to what is currently practiced in the US and abroad, what we know as Capitalism today.  But then the conversation changes very quickly. We can then ask if there are different ways of being economically capitalistic? And indeed there are. Does human greed, consumerism, imperialism, overpopulation, rapid industrialization, and the institutionalization of currency and money-lending effect our brand of Capitalism and how we have chosen to be economic? And the answer is unquestionably and emphatically YES!  So the problem isn't Capitalism. Capitalism itself as a system can be broken down to a few basic components that are not automatically immoral when combined. The problem is how we have chosen to be capitalistic or use Capitalism -- combine that with many other factors like gross-excess consumerism and overpopulation, etc., and you get what we have today.  Your idealistic 'beef' with Capitalism is a good one. But I recon its like saying, 'money is evil,' when others might say that it depends how money is used. Your putting blame in the wrong place. This has nothing to do with semantics but is very much a categorization mistake -- and I want to make that clear before we go further.  Having said that, I'm not sure how useful it is to talk about the eradication of peoples, species or environments only due to Capitalism -- because there are different factors of colonization and imperialistic practices to consider -- and what you have casually done is inadvertently 'fuse' these other factors to Capitalism -- or likened them to each other, or basically suggested 'this-from-that.'  Capitalism is not a very good reason to suggest as an explanation as to why some cultures may conquer others. It's way more complicated than that. Dr. Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs and Steel is probably the best working thesis to explain why a culture may conquer another culture. In fact, it has nothing to do with Capitalism.  'Only people have responsibilities' -- Milton Friedman  Your idea of Capitalism I believe has been stigmatized by the mess the Baby-boomer-generation created -- who are responsible for the 'consume-to-excess' brand of capitalistic practices in modern times. 'He who dies with the most toys wins' type of consumer attitudes are no longer acceptable and are changing [The Success of Capitalism, documentary].  What if I told you there are capitalists who are also minimalist? Or Communist-capitalist? Or Socialist-capitalist? Hippie-capitalist? The ideas and practice of Capitalism are changing:  There are what are known as 'B' Corporations (Benefit Corps.). 'Benefit corporations differ from traditional corporations in regards to their purpose, accountability and transparency. The purpose of a benefit corporation is to create general public benefit, which is defined as a material positive impact on society and the environment. A benefit corporation's directors operate the business with the same authority as in a traditional corporation, but where in a traditional corporation shareholders with proper standing judge the company's financial performance, here they judge qualitative performance based on the benefit corporation's stated goals to the community and environment' [wiki-benefit corps].  Companies have decided to 'go green' because they recognize it's beneficial to the environment and doing so is actually good for business and Capitalism long-term now. Consumers are speaking up and demanding more 'green' products and only supporting green companies, boycotting others.  'In 2010, the number of American businesses with formal 'green' programs in place increased 54 percent over the previous year according to new research from Buck Consultants (a subsidiary of Xerox). Of about 120 businesses surveyed 'including hardware and other technology firms, government offices, consultancies, non-profits, hospitals, and the makers of consumer packaged goods' 69 percent said they took deliberate measures to improve their environmental and social impact'.  Companies that put these environmental programs and projects in place lead off with these achievements in their quarterly and annual reports!  The EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) was established in 1970, during the height of American industrialism, precisely because we started to recognize gross-excess use of resources and the effects on the environment, which prior to this we didn't quite understand, say, Co2 emissions, or what acid rain was.  History starts to reflect this very soon after:  The CCAA (Comprehensive Clean Air Act) passes in 1970. Earth Day started in March of 1970. Clean Water Act passes in 1971. DDT get banned in 1972. Endangered Species Act passes in 1972. The Catalytic Converter in 1973. Unleaded gas is made widely available in 1973. United States banned the use of CFCs such as Freon in aerosol cans in 1978. Production of CFCs was almost completely phased out by 1994.  Civilization is now reacting to a new perspective and trying to understand and find it's environmental equilibrium while maintaining it's livelihood.  'A business that makes nothing but money is a poor business' -- Henry Ford  I think it's also interesting to note that the top philanthropist in the world responsible for the most charitable donations have recently become your American Capitalist tycoons [Forbes.com]:  1) Bill Gates 2) Warren Buffett 3) Mark Zuckerberg 4) Waltons etc.</t>

    <t>Thanks for the thoughtful rebuttal, I shall reply point to pointHistorical NarrativeFirstly, the following points are indeed true:All living things consume.Consumption effects nature.We must consume to survive.There is no reason to conclude however that this makes Capitalism moral.I will remind the voters that Capitalism is not an universal to all of history and is not the defacto system of life. Civilization itself is only several thousand years old,[1] and 'Hunting and gathering was humanity's first and most successful adaptation, occupying at least 90 percent of human history'[2]. This indeed involved our specsis relying off nature and thus altering nature. In this 90% of human history there were no trans-national corportions, anthropogenic climate change, rapid deforestation, nor tozxicization of the air. Capitalism is not inherant in the humanity nor are in it's abhorent results. One cannot render Capitalism as moral even it occupied 99% of human history, simply because a model is popular does not make it anyless morally repugnant. Fortunetly Capitalism has not even done that.Marx and CommunismMarxian thought is introduced by my opponent and he goes on to pose the following questions to me:'Did communist groups throughout history ever cut down trees in excess and accumulate a resource-surplus? Did communists ever destroy environments or species to secure these resources? Do you think communists ever produced undesirable pollutants that were expelled in the environment in order to manufacture goods or products, regardless of how they held class systems or distributed and created wealth or prosperity?'While I may infact be a Socialist these questions are wholly untopical. The resolution is capitalism immoral rather then: Communism is more moral Capitalism. I have no obligation in this debate to provide an alternative economic system with a higher rate of morality. Yes to the final question though, judge Communism of it's historical accomplishments, not theoretical framework. Before I adress the rest, lets all refresh ourselves on the definition for Capitalism to be used for this debate: 'Economic system in which most of the means of production are privately owned, and production is guided and income distributed largely through the operation of markets.'This debate is meant to demonstrate to the voters the morality of the system in question. The consequent ideology in which it is founded upon or invisioned to operate under are as detacted from reality as the Jihadist's phantasm. Thus the voters ought not to base their decision in this realm of discourse but rather the very real cost and benefits. As I pointed out in Round 2, moral decisions are based in cost-benefit analysis, how may test that which does not exist? Yet alone make moral decisions.Capitalism With a Human Face1. To provide a counter I shall qoute Craig Hanson, a Meso-American Archeologist whom has authored over twenty papers on the region: 'it is possible to hypothesize apre-capitalistworld-system' (Schneider 1977:25) in which core areas accumulated precious materialswhile exporting manufactures and peripheral areas exported materials against an inflow of finishedgoods. Thispre-capitalistworld-system created the relationships that, uponEuropeancolonization, evolved into a facet of historical capitalism in Mesoamerica[3].' Hanson here is arguing for the existence of a pre-capitalist 'world system', his prime example of a pre-capitalist society is Meso-America. Meso-American society only evolved into 'historical capitalism' after European colonization, contray to the about.com article. The full paper will be linked in cited sources.2. This article does posit that currency existed in some Pre-Columbian tribes. This article does not posit the existence of Capitalism in America amongst indigeonus tribes.Thus I will affirm to the voters that both examples are insufficent to provide a historical example of Capitalism that is devoid of “human greed, consumerism, imperialism, overpopulation, rapid industrialization, and the institutionalization of currency and money-lending.” The reason I make this affirmation is due to the fact that neither are actual examples of Capitalism.China, The Enviorment, and Philanthropy'the most capitalistic nation's Secretary of State is visiting China and working on these issues. Again, Civilization is now reacting to a new perspective and trying to understand and find it's environmental equilibrium while maintaining it's livelihood.'Both nations are talking and manuevering on the issue of climate change, but the articles do not put forth evidence that Civilization is finding an equilibriam between enviormental conservation and prosperity. This was already addressed in my qoute from Abramsky from round one which i shall reiterate:'The current worldwide system of production is based on endless growth and expansion, which is simply incompatible with a long term reduction in emissions and energy consumption. Despite the fact that localized and punctual moments of reduction may well still occur, the overall energy consumption and emissions of the system as a whole can only increase.'Regardless of the current postering that the two powerful nation states are undertaking, the world system of  capitalism is unable to stop the energy consumption at the heart of the crisis. Capitalism is, as we speak, still on the present trajectory of enviormental annihiltion. I  anticipate Con's rebuttal to the 'Expliotation of Workers' in the next round and consequenstly his reasoning for how Capitalism is infact moral. I now turn it over to Con without ant further ado.</t>

    <t>Thank you for the thoughtful reply Philosurfer. I like the lay out and how concise you kept it.  I shall reply in the same manner, for the sake of both the voters and the impending windstorm. I shall reply to three arguments my opponent has set forth in the order he arranged them:  1. Capitalism is not inherently bad 2. Green Capitalism 3. Philanthropy  Capitalism is not inherently bad Con quotes Locke, an enlightenment philosopher who would indeed-as con pointed out- influence the birth of capitalist liberal democracy. Locke though lived under feudalism and was drawing up the theoretical scaffolding for a future society. Locke’s ideal “rules”, which Con posits Capitalism today shows strident differences. But Con is right to affirm the principles that Locke outlined in the quoted passage. However the results of Capitalism are the black knight to white bishop when we compare them with Locke’s notions.  Lets put this in perspective with another political thinker’s theoretical scaffolding and the society we find today, North Korea.  The ideology of North Korea is Juche. The idea was borne in the mind of Kim Il Sung, and    the Korean State website puts it as follows:  “The Juche idea is based on the philosophical principle that man is the master of everything and decides everything. It is the man-centred world outlook and also a political philosophy to materialize the independence of the popular masses, namely, a philosophy which elucidates the theoretical basis of politics that leads the development of society along the right path.[1]”    There is nothing fundamentally immoral with this statement, the immorality of the North Korean system is presently clearly in the actions of the state: leadership of the party has passed one generation to the next, over 200,000 in prison camps, an UN report of disturbing human rights violations[2]. My point is that the morality of system cannot be judged on the ideals of it’s founders.   Secondly I challenge Con to provide a historical example of Capitalism devoid of “human greed, consumerism, imperialism, overpopulation, rapid industrialization, and the institutionalization of currency and money-lending.” My “beef” with Capitalism is very much so rooted in the modern capitalist system, the moral repugnance of this model is grounded in the modern realities not theoretical possibilities.   I can claim to my girlfriend that I will not cheat on her and that will be the foundation of our relationship. If we both proceed to do cheat, then can our relationship be judged  as one of moral strength? Of course not, nor can we judge the moral strength of Capitalism based on the writings of it’s founders.  Green Capitalism   To quote MIT lecturer Frank Ackerman: 'The apparent progress on emission reductions in rich countries has occurred at a time of widespread outsourcing of manufacturing to China and other developing countries. In the process, we have effectively outsourced our carbon emissions as well. If consumers are responsible for the emissions from making the consumer goods they buy, then we have not solved the problem.[3]'  The EPA has made these steps to appease the public. They inability to stop the destructive forces of our modern system is staggering. There is another event you ought to add to your timetable: trade with China. China is now the great industrial producer and soon to be the world’s largest economy. In Beijing the air so bad that even a Chinese Government report found the capital “barely suitable” for human life[4]. May I remind the voters that Capitalism is is a system of blatant inequity. Those responsible for producing commodities necessary to our society live in incredible suffering.     Philanthropy If Corporate philanthropy was enough then why does the previously cited global inequity deepen? It is true that is all of those with massive accumulation of capital spent it on humanitarian efforts for the poor that our present crisis would be far softened, possibly even solved. This most certainly is not the case, unless Con can introduce data that supports the contrary.  I will now turn it over to Con.</t>

    <t>EVIDENCE ANALYSIS: Pro Cites a Wiki and an Activist Website...  Round 3-Paragraph 2 amp; 3: Beachapedia.org  In rd. 3 paragraph 2- 3, PRO’s only “evidence” to support all of his assertions is a wiki known as beachapedia. A wiki in which any anonymous blogger can post her/his opinion is NOT a reliable source. Prefer CON’s more reliable evidence from professional sources like the Bloomberg Business report, Reuters, and the International Energy Agency.  Rd.3-Paragraph 4: Environmental Defense Center  In rd. 3 paragraph 4, PRO’s can only cite an activist website. This is problematic. Its political ideology will always be one-sided, and have a preconceived conclusion before researching the issue. According to a study on environmentalist organizations, they would often spread misinformation intentionally because they believed that no one would take action unless the public believed the situation was more dire than it really was (3-i). Prefer a balanced approach that accepts the complexity of the topic at hand. Prefer CON’s professional sources like Reuters, which strives for balance and objectivity.       (3-i) PROF. SOBER, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, 1986 (Princeton University Press). Paragraph 5-6: ZERO EVIDENCE  In paragraph 5-6, PRO makes a series of claims that are utterly unsupported, such as fracking causing an “economic loss” in particular regions. Yet he provides ZERO evidence to support this. Clearly, you should prefer evidence-backed arguments over unsupported claims.     Evidence Analysis Voting Issues: I have demonstrated that CON has cited the most reliable sources. PRO either cites evidence that is not applicable to the topic at hand (as I demonstrated in round-2), or websites with zero credibility (as I have demonstrated above in this response). Since Pro’s only make baseless claims, you should disregard them due to their lack of evidence. Given that PRO’s baseless claims must be disregarded, due to their lack of credible evidence, all of CON’s arguments stand unchallenged; thus you must  vote CON.   But just in case I haven’t fully persuaded you, dear reader, I will refute all of PRO’s arguments   one by one.   I - HARMS FROM OFFSHORE FRACKING ARE FAR LESS LIKELY amp; NEGLIGIBLE ONCE REGULATIONS [VIA CON’S COUNTER-PLAN] ARE ENFORCED  A. Once an industry is regulated, accidents often decrease to a negligible probability of less than 1% . According to a study by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, new regulations of the trucking industry led to far less accidents and quote, “an estimated $280 million in savings from fewer large truck crashes and $470 million in savings from improved driver health” (3-ii).  (3-ii) US Dept. of Transportation 2004. B. There are zero significant accidents once industries are properly regulated. Offshore drilling for natural gas off the coasts of the UK, Norway, Denmark, Ireland, and other countries that drill in the North Sea have higher regulations and virtually no accidents. According to a study conducted by the United Kingdom’s North Sea Authorities Forum, in which hundreds of offshore drill sites in the north sea were audited for best practices, most drill sites followed the current regulations to avoid penalties and steep fines (3-iii).   (3-iii) North Sea Authorities Forum, UK 2013. C. A study by the EPA found that once regulations are enacted the chance of a leak is less than 0.001% for most industries (3-iv).  (3-iv) EPA, 2006.  Pro asserted that leaks will happen whether or not there are regulations. My evidence demonstrates that regulations, like the ones espoused in CON’s counter-plan, do work and will reduce the risk of accidents to a negligible probability. We will be paralyzed if we ban any action that has a small (less than 1%) risk associated with it. You have a higher chance of being killed in a car accident then there being a offshore fracking leak. Should you refuse to get into a car ever again because of a tiny risk of an accident? You could, but the definite harms of a car-free lifestyle for most people outweigh the possible benefits. Likewise, if we ban all offshore fracking then thousands of shale-gas employees will definitely lose their jobs, energy prices will definitely rise, and the US economy will definitely be weaker.The environment might be better off, but the environment would have probably been fine either way. Prefer a world in which we have a realistic understanding of risk so we can act to make the world better rather than be paralyzed by fear.     II. COUNTER PLAN EXTENSION   Detecting Problem Areas to Prevent Leaks   1. New regulation - mandate the best leak proof equipment  2. New regulation - mandate frequent random checks via submerged vehicles or by underwater cameras and scanners.  NO DUMPING: RECYCLE ALL PROCESSED WATER  3. New regulation - BAN all ocean dumping and demand that all frackers follow regulations spelled out in my round 2 response, especially fracking with recycled processed water.   COMMIT THE CRIME, PAY THE MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR FINE, AND MAYBE FACE JAIL TIME  4. New Regulation: Provide companies BIG incentives to follow all the regulations by spelling out consequences of multi-billion dollar fines and criminal charges.   By implementing my counter-plan I eliminate any plausible risk of leaks, and thereby eliminate any harms to local coastal economies that a leak might cause. CON’s counter-plan preserves the enormous economic benefits of offshore fracking, and prevents any environmental harm. Following pro’s plan would cost the US millions of jobs and not make the environment any safer. Thus, you must VOTE CON.     III. COUNTER-PLAN, JOB GROWTH EXTENSION:  A.  NEW REGULATIONS CREATE JOBS   These new regulations will create demand  for new services thereby creating jobs (3-v).  (3-v) Bloomberg Business, 2012.  B. ELIMINATE ALL ENERGY SUBSIDIES AND INCREASE TAXES ON SHALE GAS PRODUCTION, TO BENEFIT PUBLIC EDUCATION (3-vi)  POLITICO, 2012. THE ATLANTIC, 2013.  C. PRO CONCEDED THAT  OFFSHORE amp; ON-LAND FRACKING SUPPORTS OVER 1.7 MILLION JOBS: Extend all of my arguments on the economic benefits of fracking. Pro did not challenge any of them. Pro’s only comment was how leaks could hurt local coastal economies but he did not provide any evidence for this claim and the counter-plan would prevent any such leaks from occurring.       IV. COAL IS WORSE  This argument was made in round-2 and dropped by Pro. If fracking offshore/onshore is banned, then there will be greater environmental damage because it will increase the use of coal.      V. LIVING LIKE NATIVE AMERICANS WON’T WORK  A. Pro’s contention that we can erase our dependence for fuel by living like the Native Americans is pure fantasy. Present-day Native Americans do not even live like this-most of them live modern lives. We should create smart policies that actually respond to they way people will behave in the real world, not the way we want them to behave in an idealized society.   B. Living like Native Americans in a pre-industrialized society would be “nasty brutish and short.”     (3-vii)   SOURCES:   The Origins of Native Americans, Crawford, 1998.  Debating Roman Demography, Scheidel, 2001. C. ECONOMIC HEALTH REAPS BENEFITS FOR GENERATIONS  Economic health, and the benefits of a good job from a natural gas producer are not “short-term” as my opponent suggests. These economic benefits have long term impacts in building a real middle class for the foreseeable future. </t>

    <t>@joza, thank you for setting up this debate. May the best argumentation win! Cheers!  Fracking should NOT be entirely banned within the sovereign territory (including bodies of water) of the United States. Rather, it should remain legal under tighter restrictions. I will provide an interpretation of the resolution, outline the current immense benefits of fracking, and then explain how all of pro's concerns can be addressed through stronger regulations.   Interpretation of Resolution: Pro believes that all off-shore fracking should be banned. Off-shore fracking is fracking conducted on platforms a few miles out to sea. However, the only evidence he cited in his round 2 response referred only to fracking done on land. His main concern is that fracking requires too much fresh water. However, off-shore fracking only uses salt water found in the ocean. So off-shore fracking has zero impact on fresh water supplies. You should vote CON on that alone since pro's main contention is not applicable to the resolution at hand, off-shore fracking NOT on-land fracking. However, in the spirit of the resolution's intent, I will argue in favor of keeping both off-shore and on-land fracking legal under tighter restrictions.   1. Benefits of Fracking / Natural Gas A. Fracked Natural Gas is Cleaner than Other Carbon Based Fuels Pro is concerned about the environment, but banning fracking will cause greater harm to the environment by forcing more people to use coal instead of natural gas. Fracking in the US produces over 60 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day. The US has become the world's greatest producer of natural gas. Natural gas supplies 24% of energy used in the United States, and emits far less CO2 gases than coal and oil (i). According to the 2008 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, coal and oil release twice as much CO2 as natural gas into the atmosphere. If fracking was banned, there would not be enough energy produced to meet demand, thereby forcing cities to use pollution heavy coal plants for their energy needs. Can't we just use solar power instead? The technology is not yet efficient enough to meet our energy needs. According to Christine Whitman, former governor of New Jersey and former head of the EPA, solar and wind power technology is not yet efficient enough to replace even a fraction of the energy supply currently served by carbon-based sources (ii). We should continue to pursue renewable forms of energy, but we need not turn out the lights on the economy by imposing draconian measures on essential natural gas production. (i) USA TODAY 2013.  (ii) Wall Street Journal 2013.   B. Jobs Fracking currently supports over 1.7 million jobs (iii). If you banned fracking you would put all of those people back into the unemployment line. In places like South Dakota, where fracking is most prevalent, the unemployment rate is around 3%, far below the national average of 7% (iv).  (iii) Bloomberg Business 2012.  C. Energy Economy Fracked natural gas has become an essential part of the US economy. As the world's leading producer of natural gas the US exports over 1,500,000 million cubic feet of natural gas a year. This brings billions of dollars into the US economy every year (v).  (v) US Energy Information Admin. 2012. 2. Ecological Concerns Pro is concerned that fracking may harm American fresh water and the quality of our air. We both want our water to be clean and our air to be safe. But banning fracking is not a practical way to do that. There are policies we can put into place that can preserve the tremendous economic benefits of fracking while conserving precious natural resources like clean air and fresh water.   3. CON's COUNTER-PLAN: Enact New Regulations on Fracking New Regulation I: Only Use Recycled Processed Water Over and Over Again Both off-shore and on-land fracking require a great deal of processed water in order to release natural gas from the ground. However, neither method requires fresh water. Off-shore fracking uses oceanic salt water, and many on-land producers use processed water over and over again (vi). New Regulation II: All Frackers Must Be in Full Compliance with the CLEAN AIR ACT and the CLEAN WATER ACT During the Bush administration, some of Cheney's associates passed a bill known as the 'Haliburton Act' in which several energy companies became exempt from the CLEAN AIR ACT, and CLEAN WATER ACT. This meant that fracking companies were not required to disclose the chemicals used in fracking. All of these companies should comply with EPA requests and disclose all ingredients used in fracking. This way every ingredient can be studied, and companies will be encouraged to develop the safest fracking recipe possible.  New Regulation III: Enclose Each Fracking Site Within Enclosed Facilities to Capture All Fumes and Chemicals from Escaping into the Environment Every natural gas site should be fully enclosed in order to contain any chemicals or fumes that might escape into the local environment. This will keep everyone safer, and serve as a way to capture an additional source of fuel.  Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is emitted in the oil and gas sector, at coal mines, landfills and manure management facilities. These emissions represent an often profitable solution to global climate change: methane can be recovered and used to produce electricity and heat. However, while there are hundreds of methane mitigation projects successfully operating around the world, much more can be done, if the right policies are in place.  New Regulation IV: All Fracking Sites May Only Target Natural Gas Shales that are a Safe Distance Away from Sources of Fresh Drinking Water This one speaks for itself.  VOTING ISSUES A. Interpretation: Even though the resolution wants to ban off-shore fracking, PRO only discussed on-shore fracking. You ought to vote CON since PRO has only provided evidence about the amount of fresh water used via on-land fracking. However, off-shore fracking uses salt-water so it's not applicable to PRO's only attack on fracking. However, if we want to interpret the intent of the resolution to be about all forms of fracking, then you still should vote CON because I explained how processed water can be recycled by frackers rather than use more fresh water.  B. Counter-Plan/New Regulations: Con has provided an alternative course of action that solves for all of Pro's ecological concerns while preserving the huge economic benefits of fracking. Therefore, you must vote CON.</t>

    <t>I stand corrected, although I did provide information behind the reason for fracking to be banned onshore (consider it an extension, showing problems which arise from onshore fracking also), there are still unjustifiable environmental implications which arise from offshore hydraulic fracturing. The environmental implications are as follows:   On offshore sites, leakage of pipes could go on for long periods of time without detection and be widely dispersed by tides and currents. The Sockeye oil field is nearby to Channel Island Marine Protected Areas and a spill or long-term leak could do major injury to the ecosystem. The South Ellwood oil field is close to the coast and could contaminate the Santa Barbara beaches for some time without detection. The area near the Ellwood fields is known for having large natural fractures in the ocean floor. Any fracking fluids injected into wells offshore could travel through natural fractures already in the rocks into the ocean waters. Approximately half the oil platforms in federal waters in the Santa Barbara Channel discharge all or a portion of their wastewater directly to the ocean, according to a California Coastal Commission document. This produced wastewater contains all of the chemicals injected originally into the fracked wells, with the addition of toxins gathered from the subsurface environment. Oil saturated the Santa Barbara Channel and washed ashore before the well at Platform A was capped - yet even after the well was capped, oil continued to seep up steadily through fractures in the ocean floor for several years. In the end, over three million gallons of water were released, fouling 35 miles of coastline, killing as many as 15,000 seabirds and poisoning dolphins, seals and sea lions. Santa Barbara's tourist-dependent local economy, business and property owners, and the local fishing industry all suffered extensive ECONOMIC loss in the wake of the spill. This information provides the environmental implications caused by offshore hydraulic fracturing. Regardless of a short-term economic gain, a tremendous long-term environmental loss will be the resultant of continous offshore hydraulic fracturing. It is of moral obligation that our environment is protected by banning such practises. What is the real necessity of a strong economy when the environment, something for our future generations to relish, is at an undeniable risk? The ends do not justify the means. Native Americans once occupied the lands with decent lives in harmony with local environment without having paramount dependancy on 'jobs' within the energy sector - why must we be different? It must also be mentioned that, in the last source aforementioned, local economic loss was extensive in the areas local to the spill which was at cause of offshore hydraulic fracturing. No matter what the case, it is inevitable that mistakes are to be made, regulation or not. CON has asserted their argument in economic gains of hydraulic fracturing, however both the economy and environment proves to both be affected in multiple ways as consequence of inexorable error with fracking. Therefore, CON's justification of fracking through economic gains is innacurate.</t>

    <t>Firstly I would like to say thankyou to my Contender, Hierocles. May this debate be constructive and educational. Offshore Hydraulic Fracturing (Fracking), should, in my opinion, be banned completely due to the implications in which it is certain to leave behind. Simply stated, the ends do not justify the means. In 2010, it was estimated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that 70 to 140 billion gallons of water was used to fracture 35,000 wells in the United States each year. This is the average annual water consumption of 40 to 80 cities each with a population of 50,000. The extraction of so much water for fracking has understandably raised concerns in relation to depletion of fresh water zones which may also be required for human consumption. In accordance with these figures, it must be noted that it requires an average of 200 truck trips per 1 million gallons of water, this means that in 2010 there was roughly 14,000 truck trips at the lowest for the process of fracking alone. With all this being said, air quality will be immensely affected if fracking is not banned.</t>

    <t>I thank my opponent for accepting my debate.Pros CasePoint A: Man-Made Global Warming existsSub point 1: Scientific consensus'Carbon dioxide and other global warming pollutants are collecting in the atmosphere like a thickening blanket, trapping the sun's heat and causing the planet to warm up. Although local temperatures fluctuate naturally, over the past 50 years the average global temperature has increased at the fastest rate in recorded history. Scientists say that unless we curb the emissions that cause climate change, average U.S. temperatures could be 3 to 9 degrees higher by the end of the century.' Scientists are undoubtedly sure that Man-Made Global warming is indeed a real threat. As is corroborated by a collection of scholarly articles. 97% of climate scientists are in agreement.(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)Point B: man-made global warming is the primary cause of Global WarmingSub point 1: Scientific Consensus'The United States Global Change Research Program (which includes the Department of Defense, NASA, National Science Foundation and other government agencies) has said that 'global warming is unequivocal and primarily human-induced' and that 'climate changes are underway in the United States and are projected to grow.''(3)'The climate change denial machine has been working hard to discredit the latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, which confirms that climate change is occurring and that human activity is primarily responsible.'(5)'Ninety-seven percent of climate scientists agree that climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities,and most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position.'(6)Again this is a case of overwhelming scientific consensus. Scientific research has been done by a countless number of experts, and they have all come to a similar agreement. Humanity is the primary cause of global warming. To challenge this claim is to challenge the authority of research giants such as NASA. Environmental scientists are the authority on this subject, and they agree with the Pro.Sub point 2: Carbon Emissions are a major cause, and a product of humanity'The only way to explain the pattern [global warming] is to include the effect of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted by humans.'(2)'Most climate scientists agree the main cause of the current global warming trend is human expansion of the 'greenhouse effect' -- warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space. Certain gases in the atmosphere block heat from escaping. Long-lived gases, remaining semi-permanently in the atmosphere, which do not respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are described as 'forcing' climate change'(7)Scientists agree that humanity has altered the balance of greenhouse gases on the earth, which is a direct major cause of global warming.Point C: The effects of global warming are extreme.Global climate change leads to:-Increased temperatures-Changing landscapes-A higher number of droughts, fires, and floods-Endangered wildlife habitats-Rising sea levels-Greater damage from extreme storms-More heat-related illness and disease-Economic problems(4)Sub point 1: man-made global warming encourages natural disaster'Hurricanes and other storms are likely to become stronger.'(2)'Anthropogenic warming by the end of the 21st century will likely cause hurricanes globally to be more intense on average (by 2 to 11% according to model projections for an IPCC A1B scenario). This change would imply an even larger percentage increase in the destructive potential per storm, assuming no reduction in storm size.'(8)With storms like sandy become more common and much stronger, Humans living in coastal regions face a very serious threat. Already hurricanes such as sandy and the recent Typhoon in the Philippines are costing billions of dollars in damages, and thousands of human lives. (9)(10)Man-made global warming is likely to cause these storms to become even more intense, therefore threatening to cost even more lives and money. These death counts and damage costs are not small, by any stretch of the imagination; with global warming left unchecked, these counts will grow.Sub point 2: Rising sea levels/flooding'Sea levels are expected to rise between 7 and 23 inches (18 and 59 centimeters) by the end of the century, and continued melting at the poles could add between 4 and 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters).'(2)'Floods and droughts will become more common. Rainfall in Ethiopia, where droughts are already common, could decline by 10 percent over the next 50 years.'(2)As polar caps warm, ice caps are likely to melt and release water into the oceans and seas, causing the levels to rise. this could result in flooding in coastal cities, such as New Orleans, that are close to, at, or below sea level.Furthermore, man-made global warming could result in more intense cycles of flooding and drought in other areas of the world, such as Ethiopia. These are real threats to human lives. Flooding, like storms, has a very high cost of both money and, more importantly, human life. Sub point 3: Future effects of man-made global warming could significantly increase the hostility of the Earth environment.There are a myriad of effects that man-made global warming will have that will make the Earth environment, generally, more hostile. 'Some diseases will spread, such as malaria carried by mosquitoes.' (2)'Less fresh water will be available. If the Quelccaya ice cap in Peru continues to melt at its current rate, it will be gone by 2100, leaving thousands of people who rely on it for drinking water and electricity without a source of either.' (2)'Below are some of the regional impacts of global change forecast by the IPCC:-North America: Decreasing snowpack in the western mountains; 5-20 percent increase in yields of rain-fed agriculture in some regions; increased frequency, intensity and duration of heat waves in cities that currently experience them.-Latin America: Gradual replacement of tropical forest by savannah in eastern Amazonia; risk of significant biodiversity loss through species extinction in many tropical areas; significant changes in water availability for human consumption, agriculture and energy generation.-Europe: Increased risk of inland flash floods; more frequent coastal flooding and increased erosion from storms and sea level rise; glacial retreat in mountainous areas; reduced snow cover and winter tourism; extensive species losses; reductions of crop productivity in southern Europe.-Africa: By 2020, between 75 and 250 million people are projected to be exposed to increased water stress; yields from rain-fed agriculture could be reduced by up to 50 percent in some regions by 2020; agricultural production, including access to food, may be severely compromised.-Asia: Freshwater availability projected to decrease in Central, South, East and Southeast Asia by the 2050s; coastal areas will be at risk due to increased flooding; death rate from disease associated with floods and droughts expected to rise in some regions.'(11)Here are some charts to illustrate further effects. (11)Current EffectsFuture EffectsHuman lives are at stake, and even the economies of the world are at stake.SummaryThere is overwhelming evidence to prove that man-made global warming is indeed real. Furthermore, the effects of man-made global warming are so massively detrimental that those who are concerned over the future of humanity ought to care greatly about the massive loss of life, cost of damage, and other miscellaneous undesirables that are consequences of man-made global warming.</t>

    <t>Outline:Most of Pro's case is focused on CO2. I will prove that CO2 as no threatening potential, even when combined with our other emissions. In order to win, Pro must prove that CO2 is a major threat, as that is the core of his argument.Rebuttal I: CO2 Global Warming PotentialPro argues that humans also give off many other emissions. I acknowledged this in my last round and discussed it's potential as well. Those gases have huge GWPs but are simply too small in the scheme of things.'Assuming the increase in the other gases ppm were the same proportionately, we would be responsible for an increase of nearly 0.20°F. This leaves 1.33°F left that human's are not responsible for.'Men's emissions simply don't account for the number needed to assume the whole of Global Warming is man-made. Methane and Nitrous, as a whole, doesn't match up to CO2 emissions alone. Making up a combined 1.31% of all Global Warming, humans making up 0.113% total (1). As for F gases, they are so few that they, with all their potential, only make up less than 0.072% of all Global Warming Potential. They are all combined to form the Misc section. We see the total GWP of Misc, Methane, Nitrious, and CO2 in a visual display.Pro's numbers are correct, but they only represent what percent of the total MAN-MADE GWP those gases make up. But when compared to the total GWP from both men and nature, it only account for 0.278%. This is far too small to be a threat to the World. I've already discussed this, and will display the chart again.GAS -- GREENHOUSE EFFECT -- HUMAN EFFECTWater Vapor ------ 95.000% -- 0.001%Carbon Dioxide -- 3.618% ---- 0.117%Methane ----------- 0.360 ------ 0.066%Nitrous oxide ------ 0.950% ---- 0.047%Misc ----------------- 0.072% ---- 0.047%Total ----------------- 100% ------- 0.278% 1). Rebuttal II: Deforestation and Indirect Emissions.I understand this argument well. I've debated it before. CO2 emissions from Deforestation is calculated into the amount listed above. Making up a pretty percent of our total emissions. Deforestation, however, isn't an issue. US forests are larger today than they were 100 years ago.(2) The US's forest growth is 42% larger than it's forest harvesting. The world replants almost every tree removed, with the UN (apart from the US) replanting 1.7 billion trees (3) and the US replanting 1.5 billion trees a year (4), the world isn't far behind it's deforestation rate. At a total replanting rate of 3.2 billion trees a year + plus ever tree planted by lumber companies. Many lumber company replants trees they cut down to ensure they always have a supply. Forests are not disappearing at close to the rate most people assume they are. It would take over 150 years for the forests in the world to be cut in half, based off US/UN replanting alone. With Lumber Companies replacement programs and all other private replantings, as well has natural Forest Growth, we may never see it at the current rate of deforestation.As for CO2 emitted by Deforestation, it's outwieghed by the amount of CO2 consumed over the lifespan of all the trees we replant. Cutting down a tree and turning it into lumber releases 1,200 lb of CO2. Ever tree we replant consumes 12,000 lb throughout it's life. This adds up, as in one year we will release 2.3 Gigatonnes cutting down trees, but the trees replanted that same year will consume 19 Gigatonnes in their lifes. A mighty profit. After the 88 years it would take to cut down every tree that is alive at this moment, we will have emitted 237.6 Gigatonnes, but the trees we replanted would have consumed a grand 661.17 Gigatonnes by then, after calculating the total consumption of CO2 every year. The first year's trees would consume 6.7 Gigatonnes by then, the next years would consume 6.67 Gigatonnes, and so on.As for ocean pollution, this is true that Ocean Pollution is a bad situation, but Pro hasn't proven that it's enough of a threat to make the Resolution true. CO2 and all it's emittions simply aren't strong enough to support Pro's case and prove the Resolution.CO2, at it's GWP, has far to go before it's a major issue. Until then, Human's aren't leaving around nearly a large enough amount to hurt the environment. Total World Emissions, including humans, only accounts for slightly above 3% of the total Green House Effect. It and every other gas Pro mentioned makes up in total 5%. If you only look at the Man-Made gases, it's only 0.555% of total effect. We know CO2 isn't that bad in the scheme of things because of how CO2 levels were around 7000 PPM in the Cambrian Period, and yet the temperature was only 10ºc higher, showing the CO2 doesn't have nearly the effect Global Warming Alarmists are predicting. Pro's own rebuttal only makes this more clear, as we will see.2 .Rebuttal III: Global Warming Cycle.Yes, CO2 is 400 PPM now, which is pretty high compared to recent cycles, temperatures are still lower than any other warming period. This is prove supporting my case. This Global Warming Period has the highest CO2 PPM (and I never said we weren't responsible for the increase in CO2, as we are, just that CO2 isn't a huge threat) and yet it is the coldest warming period to date. This is clear evidence that CO2 isn't a threat.I already knew the charts were 50 years out of date, I was hoping Pro would notice, as the charts only proof that while CO2 rises during the warming periods, it doesn't cause the warming, otherwise we would be in the hottest warming period in the last 400,000 years. Looking at the charts again, we see that, at 400 ppm, CO2 is high, but we know Global Temperatures is 1.53°F higher than 1900 at this very moment, which makes it the coldest period. Looking at the charts, we see that the coldest warming period is about 2.2°c warming than the 1950 record, while today isn't even a forth that.'As you can see, CO2 emissions are actually much much higher than they have ever been in natural history - 100 PPMs higher than ever.' -ProThis is ignorant of my arguments about how high CO2 was in the Mesozoic and Cambrian Eras. Despite the high amount of CO2, which only looks high compared to recent history, both the Cambrian and current temperatures are well under what people claim they should be. We are colder now than any other warming period in recent history, despite high CO2, because CO2 isn't that big of an issue.As for Pro's R2 points, they are mostly an Argument From Authority, from a group of people who are paid to question how humans effect Global Warming, not how Nature might also effect it.Conclusion:CO2 and all the Gases humans release do not have the power needed to prove Man-Made Global Warming is a threat. As far as numbers and data go, The mass of Global Warming we see is natural, and would happen with or without human involvememt. As said in my R2 case, CO2 has been rising since 9000 years ago, and despite high amounts of it, we still have the coldest Warming Peroid in the last 400,000 years.</t>

    <t>Points Ceded by Con-GHGs are at an all time high-Humans do emit large quantities of GHGs (which he claims is too small in proportion to general emissions)-The ocean is losing its ability to absorb GHGsDefencesI. CO2 and GHGs'Pro argues that humans also give off many other emissions. I acknowledged this in my last round and discussed it's potential as well. Those gases have huge GWPs but are simply too small in the scheme of things.''Pro's numbers are correct, but they only represent what percent of the total MAN-MADE GWP those gases make up. But when compared to the total GWP from both men and nature, it only account for 0.278%.'These arguments may seem compelling at a first glance, but that is only if one doesn't take into account climate sensitivity. Climate sensitivity is how sensitive the global climate is to energy change in the lower atmosphere. Cons argument rests on the concept that climate sensitivity is low. This is not true. Climate sensitivity is highEssentially, climate sensitivity is how much our climate warms if we double the CO2 in the atmosphere. (A) Climate SensitivityClimate sensitivity is high. If man continue to put out CO2 emissions the way we do now, the global warming trend will accelerate. The nature of global warming is such that the more heat that is trapped on earth, the worse the effects of global warming become. This is primarily because as the ocean becomes warmer and warmer, it lessens it's ability to absorb natural gas. Doubling the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere will raise global temperatures by a minimum of 2 degrees Celsius. A conservative estimate places this number closer to 4.5 degrees Celsius. (1)With the extent of man-made CO2 and its impact clearly made explicit we move on to directly address Cons case regarding the % of emissions of man-made CO2 in comparison t natural emissions.(B) The significance of man-made CO2 emissionsMy opponent argues 'Pro's numbers are correct, but they only represent what percent of the total MAN-MADE GWP those gases make up. But when compared to the total GWP from both men and nature, it only account for 0.278%. This is far too small to be a threat to the World.'Again, this may seem compelling, but when we investigate what the effect of man-made CO2 actually is, we see his point is not so compelling. Let's talk equilibrium. Equilibrium is the state where opposing forces are balanced. Nature naturally seeks this equilibrium. The massive numbers Con shows that come through natural emissions do not stay in the atmosphere (historically). Before man began to emit large amounts of CO2, nearly all natural CO2 emissions were absorbed by the ocean or the trees. The emissions were at equilibrium with the absorption. Man made GHGs have thrown this equilibrium totally out of whack. The emissions that are naturally produced do not stay in the atmosphere, and therefore do not contribute to the greenhouse effect. Man-made emissions do indeed remain in the atmosphere. (2) Consider the following graphMan made GHGs accumulate in the atmosphere and quickly accelerate the effects of the Greenhouse Effect, and thus contribute significantly to global warming. 'About 40% of this additional CO2 is absorbed. The rest remains in the atmosphere, and as a consequence, atmospheric CO2is at its highest level in 15 to 20 million years (Tripati 2009). (A natural change of 100ppm normally takes 5,000 to 20,000 years. The recent increase of 100ppm has taken just 120 years).' (2)'While fossil-fuel derived CO2 is a very small component of the global carbon cycle, the extra CO2 is cumulative because the natural carbon exchange cannot absorb all the additional CO2.' (2)'Additional confirmation that rising CO2 levels are due to human activity comes from examining the ratio of carbon isotopes (eg ? carbon atoms with differing numbers of neutrons) found in the atmosphere. Carbon 12 has 6 neutrons, carbon 13 has 7 neutrons. Plants have a lower C13/C12 ratio than in the atmosphere. If rising atmospheric CO2comes from fossil fuels, the C13/C12 should be falling. Indeed this is what is occurring (Ghosh 2003). The C13/C12 ratio correlates with the trend in global emissions.' (2)This irrefutable points out that although Con is correct in saying that the natural carbon cycle emits more CO2, the Man-made emissions have a much more potent effect on the atmosphere.Subpoint A points out the sever nature of the effects, as a rise of 2 degrees Celsius could have very severe consequences (1)SummaryMan emits a lot of GHGs. Nature emits way more, but the GHGs do not stay in the atmosphere. Mans GHGs are a major cause of global warming, as man-made GHGs remain in the atmosphere, unlike natural GHGs. The earth warms significantly. This warming further reduces the oceans ability to absorb GHGs, further increasing the damage done by Man.II. Indirect emissions(A) The effectiveness of replantingCon is correct in saying that more trees are planted than cut down, but this does not mean that GHGs are more effectively curbed. The fact is, older trees actually absorb more GHGs than younger trees.'Trees' growth accelerates with age, according to a new study in the journal Nature, which suggests that the world's oldest trees could play an important role in combating climate change. The revelation goes against the long-held assumption that trees lose their vigor with age. An analysis of more than 600,000 trees belonging to 403 species found that trees grow more as they get older, which enables them to trap more carbon than their younger counterparts.' (3) (B) The ocean, and heatingThe ocean absorbs around 40% of all carbon emissions, natural or man-made. (4)Warming the ocean significantly reduces its ability to absorb GHGs. As I have proved, Man-Made GHGs warm the earth significantly more so than natural GHGs. Natural GHGs that remain in the atmosphere due to the warming of the ocean via man-made GHGs are just indirect emissions from man. 'The world’s oceans will absorb lower amounts of carbon dioxide as they warm' (4)Therefore, you can see that humanity raises the global average by only a few degrees Celsius, and the effects of that damage 'snowballs' out of control, and results in disastrous levels of damage. SummaryI, the pro, have proved irrefutably that man-made GHGs are responsible for the warming cycles that expert environmental scientists claim to be 'impossible to be natural.' I have proved as well that man-made GHGs stay in the atmosphere longer, and therefore contribute much more to the greenhouse effect. This warming snow-balls and causes even more natural CO2 to be trapped in the atmosphere. These massive amounts of GHGs in the atmosphere heat the earth through the greenhouse effect. These GHGs are in the atmosphere because of man.Therefore, VOTE PRO! </t>

    <t>I thank my opponent for his response.RebuttalsThe Greenhouse potential of CO2This is actually an excellent point made by my opponent. There are two problems with it, though.A) Man realeases many other, potent, greenhouse gases.B) Man contributes to global warming in more ways than just producing greenhouse gases.(A) The greenhouse gamut of gasesMan produces more than just CO2 grenhouse gases. Man is also directly responsible for CH4 (methane) emissions, N20 (Nitrous Oxide) emissions, and Chlorofluorocarbons ('F' Gases). Here is a chart depicting the full impact of these gases.  • Carbon dioxide (CO2). Accounts for around three-quarters of the warming impact of current human greenhouse-gas emissions. The key source of CO2 is the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, though deforestation is also a very significant contributor. • Methane (CH4). Accounts for around 14% of the impact of current human greenhouse-gas emissions. Key sources include agriculture (especially livestock and rice fields), fossil fuel extraction and the decay of organic waste in landfill sites. Methane doesn't persist in the atmosphere as long as CO2, though its warming effect is much more potent for each gram of gas released. • Nitrous oxide (N2O). Accounts for around 8% of the warming impact of current human greenhouse-gas emissions. Key sources include agriculture (especially nitrogen-fertilised soils and livestock waste) and industrial processes. Nitrous oxide is even more potent per gram than methane. • Fluorinated gases ('F gases'). Account for around 1% of the warming impact of current human greenhouse-gas emissions. Key sources are industrial processes. F-gases are even more potent per gram than nitrous oxide. (1)  The emissions for CO2 from man alone may not account for the upward trend, but it is certainly not natural cycles. National Geographic writes, 'Scientists have spent decades figuring out what is causing global warming. They've looked at the natural cycles and events that are known to influence climate. But the amount and pattern of warming that's been measured can't be explained by these factors alone. The only way to explain the pattern is to include the effect of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted by humans.' (2)Man produces quite a bit of methane gases as well. Every methane molecule has 20 times the greenhouse potential of CO2 (2). Man actually produces 50-100 million tonnes of methane per year. This is due to the massive increase of two forms of agriculture: Beef and rice. The digestive systems of cows happen to produce a sizeable amount of methane, and rice paddies produce quite a bit as well. (3)To give these combined gases some perspective, imagine that all human gases were measured relative to CO2. Since 1990 alone, we, humanity, have increased our GHG emissions by the equivalent of 6 Gigatons of CO2, a 20% increase. (2)(B) Man contribute to the greenhouse effect both directly, and indirectly.The direct method in which man contributes to the greenhouse effect is through direct emissions of greenhouse gases. The indirect method, though, is limiting the earths ability to curb GHGs presence in our atmosphere. The two most notable effects are deforestation and oceanic pollution. I. DeforestationThe most effective way in which the earth curbs the amount of GHGs produced (specifically, CO2) is through the forests of the earth. The earths forests converts CO2 into O2 and glucose, thus reducing the amount of GHGs present in the atmosphere. Deforestation practices, however, have significantly reduced the earths ability to reduce the presence of CO2.'By most accounts, deforestation in tropical rainforests adds more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than the sum total of cars and trucks on the world’s roads. According to the World Carfree Network (WCN), cars and trucks account for about 14 percent of global carbon emissions, while most analysts attribute upwards of 15 percent to deforestation.' (4)This results in a much higher quantity of CO2 present in the atmosphere that is a result of mans interference with the environment.II. Pollution of the OceanThe ocean is also a fairly major player in the environment, and GHGs. The ocean naturalyl absorbs GHGs and reduces their concentration. Warming the environment, though, significantly reduces the oceans ability to combat the increase of GHGs.'There’s an important relationship between the atmosphere and our oceans, which is out of balance due to climate change pollution. As oceans warm, they lose their ability to absorb carbon dioxide, causing them to become 'acidified.'' (5).SummaryEven if CO2 initially has very little effect on the enironvment, we can see that the initial effects can quickly spiral out of control and 'snowball' into a much more severe effect. Man produces many more GHGs than through simple CO2 emissions. The way in which we cause the greenhouse effect is complex, but almost assuradly the most major cause of modern global warming, as is the scientific census (see Point B, Sub-point 1).Nature and Global Warming/The global warming cycle.Up until about 1950 (where many of my opponents graphs end) the warming period was totally accounted for by natual causes. It wasn't until after then that we began to realize that natual cycles cannot account for modern global warming.Here is a chart illustrating CO2 emissions in PPMs from NASA.As you can see, CO2 emissions are actually much much higher than they have ever been in natural history - 100 PPMs higher than ever. Furthermore, my Point B Subpoint 1 argument shows that the environmental scientific community is in total agreement: Natural cycles simply do not account for modern global warming. The United States Global Change Research Program (which includes the Department of Defense, NASA, National Science Foundation and other government agencies) has said 'global warming is unequivocal and primarily human-induced'SummaryThere are countless sources in my R1 argument, and in this argument, that show that the only explanation for the massive upward trend in global average temperatures is that humanity is significantly exacerbating the natural cycle, causing a warming cycle more extreme than any warming cycles in history.I reiterate, Natual Cycles cannot account for modern global warming, and environmental scientists are all in agreement over this point. Via GHG emissions-both directly.</t>

    <t>Con's case:Premise 1: Global Warming PotentialWhat few people realize about things like Green House Gas is that they are not all born equal. For example, Carbon Dioxide has a Global Warming Potential of 1. Global Warming Potential is the total effect a single amount of gas has on Global Warming. The list is has follows: (1)Carbon Dioxide -- 1Methane -- 21Nitrous Oxide -- 298-310CFC's -- VariousWater Vapor -- 0.25With this in mind, we move on.1). Argument I: The Effects of Man-Made Carbon Dioxide.Human's release approximately 35 gigatons of Carbon Dioxide into the atmosphere each year (2). Only 4.3% of the 812 gigatons released total every year. Even at only 4.3% of total CO2 emmissions, our effect over it, is mild at most. Carbon Dioxide is very weak, as opposed to common census, having only a Global Warming Potential of 1.In total, Carbon Dioxide makes up a grand total of 3.618% of the total Gas House Effect (3). Water vapor makes up 95% of the total Greenhouse Effect. Carbon Dioxide's number increased from 295 ppm to 400 ppm, an increase of 105 ppm. 1 Gigaton of CO2 is worth 2.13 ppm (4), so an increase of 105 ppm would equal 49.29 gigatons. Since 1 gigaton of CO2 is worth 0.004% of total Greenhouse Effect, 49.29 gigatons is worth an additional 0.21% to the Greenhouse Effect, a total temperature increase of 0.15°F. That means we are responsible for 10% of total increased warming.Assuming human's did in fact raise the amount of CO2 by 105 ppm, the effect on the climate would be measly. Temperatures would raise only 0.28% since then. People gravely exaggerate to effect of CO2 on the climate. It is the second weakest Greenhouse Gas in the world behind Water Vapor. GAS -- GREENHOUSE EFFECT -- HUMAN EFFECTWater Vapor ------ 95.000% -- 0.001%Carbon Dioxide -- 3.618% ---- 0.117%Methane ------------ 0.360 ------ 0.066%Nitrous oxide ----- 0.950% ---- 0.047%Misc ------------------- 0.072% ---- 0.047%Total ------------------ 100% ------- 0.278% Assuming the increase in the other gases ppm were the same proportionately, we would be responsible for an increase of nearly 0.20°F. This leaves 1.33°F left that human's are not responsible for.Many people would claim we've caused temperatures to raise enough to evaporate enough water to make up the difference. This would be entirely irrational. At an increase of 0.20°F, water wouldn't evaporate much more than it was prior. Thats less of a difference in tempature shift than what we'd see from one minute to the next. The argument assumes 0.20°F can heat up the ocean enough to make up such a wide difference. Such an increase from only 0.20°F would mean that the ocean would be boiling in the summer (temperatures of 90°F and up, an increase of 31.88°F from normal temperature). It's a weak and unsustainable excuse. Even at 1.53°F, it's not likely.2). Argument II: Argument From Nature:Is it entirely possible for nature to be responsible? Of course. Nature has seen worse times then now. CO2 ppm is at 400 right now, but in the Mesozoic period, long before man, it reached 2000-4000 ppm.(5) 7000 ppm in the Cambrian Period. This implies that people aren't needed for absolutely unbelievable increases in ppm. It's entirely possible for nature to do this on it's own. Another issue this brings up is that, at 7000 ppm, 6705 ppm larger than in 1900 (63.8% larger than the 105 ppm increase) the temperatures were 10ºc higher then than today. Proportionately, temperatures should have been 54.23ºc higher then than today. This empathizes high little of an impact CO2 has on the global temperature.So what in nature right now could be causing such in increase in temperature? A basic cycle.5) Argument III: The Global Warming Cycle:Global Warming activists love mentioning how temperatures are higher now than they were in Human History, forgetting how Human History is only 10,000 years old at most.In the chart above, we see that past warming periods. Take into account that the temperature of today is now above anything on that list, and then look at the past 400,000 years.According to the data, the World has been heating and cooling rapidly for 100's of thousands of years, back past a few million, even. It has been the world's cycle. CO2 ppm has been following along. Right now it's where it should be increasing. CO2 has been raising in recent history (15,000 years) and it's merely continuing to, with or without humans. Temperatures, as well, have been randomly going up and down in the past 15,000 years. Long before industrialization. Of course temperatures are up... We're in the warming cycle. We are actually in the coldest warming cycle in the past 400,000 years, the fact that it isn't warmer is amazing. To assume human's are responsible is more Post Hoc then anything else. Temperatures SHOULD be increasing right now. It's only natural.CO2 is so unimportant, that despite a rapid increase around the 9,000 year period, temperatures have decreased more than increased, and quite on it's own accord.Conclusion:Human's are responsible for very little of the Green House Effect. Our biggest contribution is CO2, which (and my opponent will probably stick to CO2 as his weapon) is very uninfluencial in the overall scheme of things. The increase in CO2 has been going on steadily since over 9,000 years ago. It's nothing new.There is nothing unique about this warming period other than how cold it is. Human's contribution to Global Warming is minuscule, and isn't a threat to human life. Global Warming might be a risk, at most, in time, while not likely... But Man-Made Global Warming is not.</t>

    <t>I accept.  Definitions:  GWP (Global Warming Potential) = The total effect on Global Warming per ppm.</t>
<h>Outline: With most of Pro's argument based off the effect of CO2, I simply have to show that CO2 has a minor effect on Global Warming. I already have the historical data to prove it.Rebuttal I: Importance of CO2Pro brings up Climate Sensitivity. It's a common and exaggerated argument. The GWP measures how sensitive the Climate is to that element. 1 Gigaton of vapor has far less than the effect on the climate of half a Gigaton of CO2. Climate Sensitivity has already been addressed as soon as GWP was brought into the discussion. That being said, with a GWP of 1, not much is happening to the climate...My argument about the Cambrian Era emphasizes this. At 7000 ppm, The climate was only 10ºc. If the climate was as sensitive to CO2 as Pro claims, the Cambrian Era would have been 50ºc higher or more, and literally unsurvivable for the Dinosaurs living during it. If climate was as fragile as Pro claims, we would be in, by far, the hottest warming period in the last 400,000 year, not the coldest. Those two things are issues Pro's argument simply disreguards.A) Climate SensitiveClimate Sensitivity is hardly as intense as Pro claims. If you view my charts in R3, you will again see that CO2 is 25% higher than any other period, but the temperature hasn't followed. Why? Because CO2 doesn't have a large effect on temperature. I've already done the math in R2 showing that the increase in CO2 only accounts for 0.15°F of the total increase in temperature, which says a lot, since the total increase in temperature still leaves us freezing in comparison to other warming periods.The claim about the potention effect CO2 has and what the actual data say just aren't agreeing. Climate Sensitivity would have took effect in the Cambrian era as well, and let the tempature was well under what Pro needs to back his case.B) Man-Made CO2Much of Pro's argument is based on how much CO2 human's release... Which I've already brought up. We do tip the pot, I've said this... And we did increase the amount of CO2 in the air, I've said this... And yet the data STILL says it's doing little to nothing. Why? Because, again, CO2 is weak. The amount we release simply isn't doing anything. Again looking at my math in R2, the total increase in CO2 has had an affect of 0.15°F.Pro is arguing in circles. 'CO2 is increasing' 'The increase is doing nothing' 'But the CO2 is increasing.' Pro is simply arguing in circles, repeating his last round. We already brought up the increase in CO2, I already explained the insignificance of the increase... I even brought up how much we added... In fact, my numbers were higher than Pro's (35 Gigatons to Pro's 29 Gigatons). The increase in CO2 has been recorded, and the increase in temperature has been recording, and the correlation is small and unsupportive of Pro's case.Pro is chasing his tail, and begging the question. Claiming the increase in CO2 is bad because we are increasing CO2, ignoring every argument made showing how little of an affect that increase actually has. Pro is showing how much it's increasing, but as let to show the affect of that increase. I have shown the affect of that increase, and it is minor.Rebuttal II: Indirect EmissionsIt should be mentioned that Indirect Emissions aren't ignored when measuring PPM. The 400 ppm still includes those. That being said, Indirect Emissions have already been calculated, and do not hold some potential that was overlooked in the chart's I've shown. The increase in CO2 from Indirect Emissions isn't hidden. We see it just like we see any other. They were already accounted for.A) Tree Replanting.My math, in regards to CO2 consumption, is based on an average rate. Not the rate at which new trees consume CO2. Even if the amount consumed was much smaller, it doesn't say much against how wide the gap was. 661.17 Gigatons consumed compared to 237.6 Gigatons made. The total consumption rate by the end of 88 years would have to be cut down by 63%. Odds are, the decrease in CO2 consumption will likely never be that extreme. The gap in Consumption and Emissions is simply too large. If cut in half, the Consumption would be widely above Emission.B) Ocean and HeatingThis argument is flawed in that it ignores just how small the temperature increase from man-made emissions is. As explained, human emissions (all emission, Methane, Nitrous, and F Gases included) is responsible for an increase of 0.20°F, the rest being natural. Pro gravely exaggerates the affect of CO2 on the ocean's ability to absorb CO2. If it was as sensitive as he claims, once the extremely hot Summer season hits the ocean, it would never end. Also the increase needed, being several degrees Celsius, as Pro mentions, is far from the current increase. Assume it takes 4°c... It would take 666 years to reach that, as it took 134 years to see temperature increase by 0.85°c. This is a causational paradox. Claiming that Global Warming is causing X to create Global Warming. What's causing the temperature to rise? The Ocean's efficency going down. What's causing it to go down? The rising temperature that it was causing. Claiming that X, caused by Y, is causing Y to cause X in the first place. As well, all pro is doing is listing off new ways CO2 is building up. My data includes TOTAL ppm, including direct and indirect. That 400 ppm we are taking about doesn't somehow exclude CO2 from the ocean. For EVERY way pro claims CO2 is raising, it still doesn't prove CO2 is influential enough to be a threat, while my data shows it isn't.Final Defense:CO2 just doesn't have the needed impact to claim human's are responsible for most of Global Warming. The Cambrian Era and the past 400,000 years went unchallenged. Every variable Pro brought up would have effected temperatures in the past as well, and yet the temperature in the Cambrian era was well under what it'd have to be for Pro's claim to be true.As the data shows, the Cambrian Era (550 mya to 480 mya) was nearly 8°c above today, despite having 17x the CO2. This chart, like all my other charts, takes into account the whole temperature as it is/was. Every variable and hidden factor that Pro brings in is accounted for. If it's not, that's because the variable literally didn't effect the temperature. The temperature doesn't exclude increases from the decrease in CO2 consumption in the Ocean, if that increases temperature, we'll see it on the chart. With every variable took into effect, temperature to CO2 ratio just doesn't add up to Pro's claim. If CO2 was as capable of the kind of Global Warming Pro claims, directly and indirectly, temperatures in the Cambrian era, and today, would be much higher. Pro acts as though every variable he brought up doesn't show up on my charts, as though they only now exist. They have been involved the whole time. The temperature has increased 1.5°F, that increase is already caused by every variable Pro mentioned, and yet it's still leaves us with the coldest warming period in the last 400,000 years, and my math (using the GWP of thg gases) only makes up a small portion of that increase. To small of an increase to snowball out control. If an increase of 0.20°F is enough to cause what Pro claims, Summer would be devastating.All of Pro's arguments simply ignores the data.As seen in my charts, CO2 rises with temperature, but isn't causing (most) of the temperature increase. The argument is Post Hoc. CO2 may rise with tempature, but it doesn't cause the temperature. If it did, the Cambrian era would e 4-5x hotter, and we'd be at least 6x hotter. History simply shows that CO2 isn't strong enough to have a major impact on tempature.1) http://www.geocraft.com...Conclusion: Men-made Global Warming doesn't make up a large part of the Global Warming cycle, and isn't a threat.CO2's effect is small, as has been seen long ago and today. In order for Pro's arguments to be accurate and right, temperatures today must be well above all the temperatures of the last 400,000 years. The fact that temperatures have barely risen with CO2 shows the minimal impact CO2 has on it.Pro's arguments are begging the question. He claims CO2 level raising are an issue because we are increasing CO2, ignoring that data, and GWP of CO2, deems the increase near harmless.CO2 simply does not bare to Global Warming Impact needed to prove Pro's case. Human's are not responsible for most the temperature increase, and our influence simply isn't a threat to humanity.</h>

    <t>Outline: With most of Pro's argument based off the effect of CO2, I simply have to show that CO2 has a minor effect on Global Warming. I already have the historical data to prove it.Rebuttal I: Importance of CO2Pro brings up Climate Sensitivity. It's a common and exaggerated argument. The GWP measures how sensitive the Climate is to that element. 1 Gigaton of vapor has far less than the effect on the climate of half a Gigaton of CO2. Climate Sensitivity has already been addressed as soon as GWP was brought into the discussion. That being said, with a GWP of 1, not much is happening to the climate...My argument about the Cambrian Era emphasizes this. At 7000 ppm, The climate was only 10ºc. If the climate was as sensitive to CO2 as Pro claims, the Cambrian Era would have been 50ºc higher or more, and literally unsurvivable for the Dinosaurs living during it. If climate was as fragile as Pro claims, we would be in, by far, the hottest warming period in the last 400,000 year, not the coldest. Those two things are issues Pro's argument simply disreguards.A) Climate SensitiveClimate Sensitivity is hardly as intense as Pro claims. If you view my charts in R3, you will again see that CO2 is 25% higher than any other period, but the temperature hasn't followed. Why? Because CO2 doesn't have a large effect on temperature. I've already done the math in R2 showing that the increase in CO2 only accounts for 0.15°F of the total increase in temperature, which says a lot, since the total increase in temperature still leaves us freezing in comparison to other warming periods.The claim about the potention effect CO2 has and what the actual data say just aren't agreeing. Climate Sensitivity would have took effect in the Cambrian era as well, and let the tempature was well under what Pro needs to back his case.B) Man-Made CO2Much of Pro's argument is based on how much CO2 human's release... Which I've already brought up. We do tip the pot, I've said this... And we did increase the amount of CO2 in the air, I've said this... And yet the data STILL says it's doing little to nothing. Why? Because, again, CO2 is weak. The amount we release simply isn't doing anything. Again looking at my math in R2, the total increase in CO2 has had an affect of 0.15°F.Pro is arguing in circles. 'CO2 is increasing' 'The increase is doing nothing' 'But the CO2 is increasing.' Pro is simply arguing in circles, repeating his last round. We already brought up the increase in CO2, I already explained the insignificance of the increase... I even brought up how much we added... In fact, my numbers were higher than Pro's (35 Gigatons to Pro's 29 Gigatons). The increase in CO2 has been recorded, and the increase in temperature has been recording, and the correlation is small and unsupportive of Pro's case.Pro is chasing his tail, and begging the question. Claiming the increase in CO2 is bad because we are increasing CO2, ignoring every argument made showing how little of an affect that increase actually has. Pro is showing how much it's increasing, but as let to show the affect of that increase. I have shown the affect of that increase, and it is minor.Rebuttal II: Indirect EmissionsIt should be mentioned that Indirect Emissions aren't ignored when measuring PPM. The 400 ppm still includes those. That being said, Indirect Emissions have already been calculated, and do not hold some potential that was overlooked in the chart's I've shown. The increase in CO2 from Indirect Emissions isn't hidden. We see it just like we see any other. They were already accounted for.A) Tree Replanting.My math, in regards to CO2 consumption, is based on an average rate. Not the rate at which new trees consume CO2. Even if the amount consumed was much smaller, it doesn't say much against how wide the gap was. 661.17 Gigatons consumed compared to 237.6 Gigatons made. The total consumption rate by the end of 88 years would have to be cut down by 63%. Odds are, the decrease in CO2 consumption will likely never be that extreme. The gap in Consumption and Emissions is simply too large. If cut in half, the Consumption would be widely above Emission.B) Ocean and HeatingThis argument is flawed in that it ignores just how small the temperature increase from man-made emissions is. As explained, human emissions (all emission, Methane, Nitrous, and F Gases included) is responsible for an increase of 0.20°F, the rest being natural. Pro gravely exaggerates the affect of CO2 on the ocean's ability to absorb CO2. If it was as sensitive as he claims, once the extremely hot Summer season hits the ocean, it would never end. Also the increase needed, being several degrees Celsius, as Pro mentions, is far from the current increase. Assume it takes 4°c... It would take 666 years to reach that, as it took 134 years to see temperature increase by 0.85°c. This is a causational paradox. Claiming that Global Warming is causing X to create Global Warming. What's causing the temperature to rise? The Ocean's efficency going down. What's causing it to go down? The rising temperature that it was causing. Claiming that X, caused by Y, is causing Y to cause X in the first place. As well, all pro is doing is listing off new ways CO2 is building up. My data includes TOTAL ppm, including direct and indirect. That 400 ppm we are taking about doesn't somehow exclude CO2 from the ocean. For EVERY way pro claims CO2 is raising, it still doesn't prove CO2 is influential enough to be a threat, while my data shows it isn't.Final Defense:CO2 just doesn't have the needed impact to claim human's are responsible for most of Global Warming. The Cambrian Era and the past 400,000 years went unchallenged. Every variable Pro brought up would have effected temperatures in the past as well, and yet the temperature in the Cambrian era was well under what it'd have to be for Pro's claim to be true.As the data shows, the Cambrian Era (550 mya to 480 mya) was nearly 8°c above today, despite having 17x the CO2. This chart, like all my other charts, takes into account the whole temperature as it is/was. Every variable and hidden factor that Pro brings in is accounted for. If it's not, that's because the variable literally didn't effect the temperature. The temperature doesn't exclude increases from the decrease in CO2 consumption in the Ocean, if that increases temperature, we'll see it on the chart. With every variable took into effect, temperature to CO2 ratio just doesn't add up to Pro's claim. If CO2 was as capable of the kind of Global Warming Pro claims, directly and indirectly, temperatures in the Cambrian era, and today, would be much higher. Pro acts as though every variable he brought up doesn't show up on my charts, as though they only now exist. They have been involved the whole time. The temperature has increased 1.5°F, that increase is already caused by every variable Pro mentioned, and yet it's still leaves us with the coldest warming period in the last 400,000 years, and my math (using the GWP of thg gases) only makes up a small portion of that increase. To small of an increase to snowball out control. If an increase of 0.20°F is enough to cause what Pro claims, Summer would be devastating.All of Pro's arguments simply ignores the data.As seen in my charts, CO2 rises with temperature, but isn't causing (most) of the temperature increase. The argument is Post Hoc. CO2 may rise with tempature, but it doesn't cause the temperature. If it did, the Cambrian era would e 4-5x hotter, and we'd be at least 6x hotter. History simply shows that CO2 isn't strong enough to have a major impact on tempature.1). Conclusion: Men-made Global Warming doesn't make up a large part of the Global Warming cycle, and isn't a threat.CO2's effect is small, as has been seen long ago and today. In order for Pro's arguments to be accurate and right, temperatures today must be well above all the temperatures of the last 400,000 years. The fact that temperatures have barely risen with CO2 shows the minimal impact CO2 has on it.Pro's arguments are begging the question. He claims CO2 level raising are an issue because we are increasing CO2, ignoring that data, and GWP of CO2, deems the increase near harmless.CO2 simply does not bare to Global Warming Impact needed to prove Pro's case. Human's are not responsible for most the temperature increase, and our influence simply isn't a threat to humanity.</t>

    <t>Final Defense:Defense 1: Global Warming Potential of CO2The Global Warming Potential of CO2 is, simply said, weak. So weak that it does little to affect Global Temperatures even with massive sums of it in the air. Despite how focused we are on CO2, it simply isn't as big a deal to the environment, and history backs this up. At 400 PPM at the present, this should be the hottest Global Warming cycle of all time, but it is the coldest. The two don't correlate well enough. CO2 rises with temperature, but temperature doesn't really rise well with it.Temperatures are actually low. Through out history, CO2 will correlate when temperatures rose, but temperatures didn't follow well when CO2 rose, often well under the CO2 count of that era. This is for the same reason that today is colder than any other Global Warming Cycle. The effect CO2 has on Global Warming is minimal at most, and not qualified as a *threat to humanity*. With a GWP of only 1, history emphasizes the weakness of the gas, while people exaggerate the strength of it. At only 3.6% of the total GWP effect, and humans at only 0.117% of that, human emissions are not a threat to the planet.Defense II: Other Gases and Earth's Sensitivity.All other human emissions are greatly small in comparison to CO2, even with higher Global Warming Potentials. F-gases and other poisonous substances we throw into the air have massive GWPs, but are so small in number, that all put together still only effects 0.072% of the total Greenhouse Effect, and human's are responsible for only 0.047% of that. The gases, all together, contribute only 2% of what CO2 does, and since the evidence and history shows CO2 does little, we can only assume our other gases do much less.Earth's Sensitivity is high, but it is gravely exaggerated upon. History shows that, specifically the Cambrian Era. If Earth's Sensitivity was as high as people claim, and 400 PPM CO2 or anything close to it could cause a major snowballing effect, we would have seen it there. At 7000 ppm, the Cambrian Era should have snowballed into temperatures we can't measure on conventional thermostats. And the sea level would have been well below ours, not 30-90 meters above. The Snowballing effect simply isn't there, not for CO2 at least.A) DeforestationDeforestation does release a lot of CO2, but this CO2 isn't hidden from view, it is accounted for in every measurement I made. Having done the math, Total CO2 consumption from trees we replant over the next 88 years is well above 3x the amount we produce through deforestation based on an average annual consumption per tree... Even if CO2 Consumption was half as effective the whole of the next 88 years, we would still see it 100 gigatons above emissions (a decrease of 213 ppm worth, or 850 ppm at the original measurements).Defense III: Global Warming CycleThe past millions of years have seen a continuous cycle of Global Warming. Each one hotter than today's, despite lower CO2 emissions. Assuming Humans are responsible for Global Warming is more Post Hoc, since our emissions are minimal in effect. This Global Warming Cycle has been going on long before human's began throwing out emissions, and CO2 has been rising since 9,000 years ago. That being said, it's more likely that natural CO2 emissions having been growing as well, otherwise CO2 ppm should have been going down until the Industrial Age.Assuming CO2 causes most Global Warming is ignorant of the history of Global Warming, where high amounts of CO2 never correlated well with equally high temperature, as is the same today. At least, not in a way that supports the notion that CO2 plays a major part in increasing temperatures. The Global Warming Cycle in the past 400,000 years has never seen CO2 PPM this high before, being 25% higher than any other example. Temperature is, however, the coldest. This is because CO2 has never been a major part of Global Warming. Correlating with it, but not causing it. The Global Warming Cycle of the past 400,000 years prove this, as well as Global Warming in the deep past. In the Cambrian Era and Mesozoic Era, CO2 was wildly above ours, but temperature was't proportionately as high. The Current Global Warming cycle is entirely natural. Looking back at the charts, we should be in a warming cycle. Saying Global Warming is mostly man-made is ignorant of the fact that this cycle looks just like every cycle.Final Conclusion: Human emissions contribute little to Global Warming, which is evident in how cold our current cycle is. CO2 has never increased temperatures to any proportionate amount, and the Earth Snowball-Sensitive effect just isn't present in any historical data.Pro has dropped the case of CO2 consumption from tree replanting.I have proven how:  CO2 has a minimal effect, even when compiled. Deforestation isn't nearly the issue it's exageratted to be. The Earths Sensitivity isn't nearly intense enough to cause a massive Snow-balling effect. We are colder than any other Warming Period. How natural Global Warming is.  I have proven that CO2. and man-made gases, simply contributes little to nothing, as history and even today's chart prove. Thank you for this debate, Pro.Vote Con!</t>

    <t>ConclusionFinal Defences(A) Climate sensitivityMy opponent attempts to prove that the climate sensitivity is exaggerated, but gives no sources to suggest that climate sensitivity is really exaggerated the way he explains. The source I cited is written by an environmental scientist, who has posted the calculations on how he calculated climate sensitivity. He dismisses them by pointing to the cambrian era, but this is not an acceptable rebuttal. Climate sensitivity is not static. The cambrian era likely had a lower level of climate sensitivity.(B) Man Made CO2I've stated that CO2 'tips the pot' and proved it. Con cedes this. Con says that I agree that CO2 does nothing. This is not true. In my previous arguments, I've stated that although CO2 does have a low GWP, doesn't mean that it is non-existent. My point is not begging the question, as I have argued a point of instigation: when man emitted large volumes of CO2. The majority of CO2 and other misc. GHGS that remain in the atmosphere are man-made, as I proved in my R4 argument. The GWP of CO2 in particular may be low, but it still has GWP. Every fraction of a degree that the temp is raised by CO2 further accelerates the global warming effect by reducing the oceans ability to absorb CO2 (as I stated in my R4 argument). My opponents points, when freshly cross examined with my previous points, can be seen as invalid.Con cedes that Man-made CO2 emissions disrupt the CO2 cycle. This disproves his point regarding the cambrian era (as man was not present, the CO2 cycle would have been in balance). Con cedes that warming oceans have lessened ability to absorb CO2, but claims that this point is begging the question. Pro proves that that point is not begging the question, as the initial warming is instigated by the CO2 (and other GHGs) that man emits that disrupt the natural cycle.The correlation isn't low, as con states. The earth is warming, directly after man disrupts the CO2 cycle. Con may dismiss scientific consensus as an appeal to authority, but it can be argued that if literally thousands of expert climatologists are in agreement that there is sufficient evidence to say that man-made global warming is significantly changing the environment, then they are probably correct.C) TreesCon cedes that Older trees more efficiently absorb CO2, than younger trees. Forward this point.D) Warming OceansCon attempts to disprove this point simply by saying ' once the extremely hot Summer season hits the ocean, it would never end.' But this is simply forced misinterpretation of how the ocean is affected by the world temperature. One hot summer does not warm the ocean sufficiently to see a drastic change in its ability to absorb, as the entire planet is hot during one regions summer. Only global rising averages really shift the temperature of the ocean. 'Assume it takes 4°c... It would take 666 years to reach that, as it took 134 years to see temperature increase by 0.85°c.'This is an interesting point made by con, but totally fails to account for temperature acceleration. This point is only true if one assumes that the rate at which temperature changes is always constant. If one looked at the 134 year period he mentions, you would see that the rate of warming accelerated, and was fastest during the latter portion.Final StatementsMy opponents final argument has boiled down to essentially 2 points.1) CO2 has a low GWP 2) The cambrian era had a ton of CO2, but wasn't as hot as it 'should' have been. Both points are easily rebutted by my previous arguments. Point one is rebutted in that I have proved that although CO2 has a low GWP, doesn't mean that it is negligable. I have proved previously that any amount of warming caused by CO2 has the potential to accelerate out of control.Point two is rebutted by my climate sensitivty argument, and my carbon cycle argument. It is rebutted by my climate sensitivity argument, in that the cambrian era likely had lower sensitivity. It is rebutted by my CO2 cycle argument, in that the cambrian era CO2 cycle was not disrupted by unnatural interference. Note: These are cross-examinations, not new rebuttals.These are the points ceded by Con.-Man made GHGs disrupt the natural cycle of GHG emissions and absorbtion. -Man made GHGs remain in the atmosphere, unlike natural GHGs, and can build up in the atmosphere, therefore significantly contributing to the greenhouse effect.-Deforestation contributes significantly to the reduction of the natural absorbtion of GHGs.-When the ocean warms, its ability to absorb CO2 is reduced.-Therefore, warming from CO2 (among other GHGs) has the potential to accelerate the greenhouse effect.Con has zero assertions standing in his argument. The Pro has a multitude of points that all indicate that man is significantly contributing to global warming. The evidence for Pro is overwhelming. The scientific backing is solid. That is the reason why environmental scientists have come to the census that they did.Con has no argument.VOTE PRO!</t>

Evidence is only to be presented when asked for Last speeches, no new evidence is to be presented 1st speech- opening 2nd- rebuttals 3rd- more rebuttals 4th- summary 5th- Closing statement Good luck! PRO- Case Definitions  First, we offer the CIA World Factbook's definition of 'developed countries,' which includes just over thirty nations that are generally first-world and feature service-oriented economies.  Standard- The standard of today's debate, or weighing mechanism, should be deontology. Since this topic is about moral obligations and deontology is about the morality of actions and its justification, we believe that the team that adheres to this standard should win this debate.  1. Alternative- Adaptation Adapting is the correct way to go in the process of mitigating. Since today's topic is about mitigating the effects of climate change, and not mitigating climate change, as the affirmative team, it is our ground to be able to 'adapt' to the effects of climate change.  According to epa.gov, some of the effects of climate change are that heavy rainfall or flooding can increase water-borne parasites that are sometimes found in drinking water. These parasites can cause, in severe cases, death. One instance to mitigating the effects of climate change includes vaccinating, which is cheap and extremely effective. According to givewell.org, it costs only $14 to vaccinate a child, and The UNICEF states that 9 million lives are saved from vaccines annually.  The impact is clear. It would be better to adapt to the effects of climate change. One of the effects is disease, and if we can save all these people from disease by administering vaccines, for a small price of $14 per child, we should win this debate. 2. Economy If developed countries mitigate the effects of climate change, the economy will grow. According to the UN, Renewable energy generates more jobs than fossil fuels. Worldwide, jobs in renewable energy industries exceeded 35 million in 2010. $211 billion were invested in the renewable industries in 2010. Obviously, the renewable energy industries create a bigger impact than fossil fuels, and are capable to generate more jobs in the future than fossil fuel industries will be able to.  A study done by the Natural Resource Defense Council said that if present trends continue, these four global warming impacts alone will come with a price tag of almost 1.9 trillion annually (in today's dollars), by 2100.  The Impact is that Mitigating the effects of climate change is important because of how much it is costing the world. With more jobs being created, the economy is being reboosted. Obviously countries have a moral obligation if climate change is costing them money. 3. Moral Obligation Developed countries have the obligation to fix the mess that they created. After all, it is the developed country's fault, and they should fix it. The United states is making nearly 5,500 million tonnes CO2 emissions (Guardian). Developed Countries should also have the moral obligation to not contribute to campaigns that kill human beings. For example, terrorism:  It is oil money that enables Saudi Arabia [and many other countries] to invest approximately 40% of its income on weapons procurement. In July 2005 undersecretary of the Treasury, Stuart Levey, testifying in the Senate noted 'Wealthy Saudi financiers and charities have funded terrorist organizations and causes that support terrorism and the ideology that fuels the terrorists' agenda. Even today, we believe that Saudi donors may still be a significant source of terrorist financing.' - Institute for the Analysis of Global security. Over 12,000 people were killed by terrorist attacks in 2011- according to the National Counter Terrorism Center  Judge, what this means is that many patrons of terrorism happen to be oil and gasoline investors. If we buy gasoline, these supporters of terrorism would earn money, and stuff their profits into supporting terrorist groups, leading to deaths inside our own country and other places around the world. But if we switch to green energy, we would significantly decrease the profits of these terrorism supporters, and as a result, save many lives.  The Impact is clear. Countries have the moral obligation to solve the problems that they have created, and also to try and save the lives of their own citizens from acts like terrorism, by trying to mitigate the effects of climate change.  4. The Environment Climate Change causes the environment to be affected. All the more reason for countries to mitigate its effects. According to Nasa, Approximately 20-30% of plant and animal species are likely to be at increased risk of extinction if increases in global average temperature exceeds 1.5-2.5'C.  We need to get prepared for four degrees of global warming, Bob Watson [PhD in Chemistry, Award for Scientific Freedom and Responsibility] told the Guardian last month.Weather would become extreme and unpredictable, with more frequent and severe droughts, floods and hurricanes. The Earth's carrying capacity would be hugely reduced. Billions would undoubtedly die.  The Impact is that if the Earth's temperatures rises just the slightest amount, millions might die! We must mitigate these effects before it is too late.</h>

    <t>Developed countries do not have a moral obligation to mitigate the effects of climate change. In this debate, I will be introducing several arguments. Firstly, I will be explaining how developed countries are not in the position to lessen the gravity of climate change, and therefore there is no moral obligation towards them. Secondly I will be talking about how other 'developing countries' have the biggest incentive to reduce emissions, and therefore they must share the burden and the moral obligation towards mitigating the effects. Following on from this, I will be explaining how developing nations are just as capable as developed nations of taking on the burden of climate change.  'Developed countries' are not in the position to mitigate the effects of climate change, and therefore possess no moral obligation to do this. Many economists consider the financial crisis of 2007'2008, the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Countries suddenly found themselves in debt of millions of dollars, along with unemployment rates reaching unprecedented levels. Some of the countries that were affected are indeed considered 'developed countries', and are found on the CIA World Fact book list. These countries include Greece, Portugal, Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Belgium, Ireland, United Kingdom and the United States. The figure for Greek government debt at the end of 2009 was 299.7 billion euros (130% of GDP). This led to disastrous social effects; as showed by the figure for the percentage of people living at 'risk of poverty or social exclusion', calculated at 33% in 2011. In 2011, 111000 Greek companies went bankrupt (27% higher than in 2010). Greece was not the only country that suffered. Spain's economy continues to shrink, whilst unemployment rates have reached 27%. Likewise, unemployment in Portugal is also high, while the government continues to reduce the budget in many important sectors as well as in social welfare. These countries are in no position to mitigate the effects of climate change. They possess an obligation to the peoples of their country: to reduce debt and cut unemployment rates. This must be dealt with, and is their primary moral obligation. If these problems are not dealt with, there will be many more social and political ramifications.  Developing countries have the biggest incentive to reduce the effects of climate change; and thus they must share the moral obligation. Developing countries are expected to be the countries who will suffer the worst effects of climate change, comparatively more developing countries are outside temperate zones so will be harder hit by rising temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns. Unfortunately, it is the case that countries that have the wealth to tackle these problems are not going to take the lead in reducing emissions. These countries must take responsibility and act in response to climate change; as it their responsibility.  The next point ties in with my first argument. I strongly believe developing nations are just as capable as developed nations of taking on the burden of effects of climate change. There is a common assumption that developed countries are the only countries who can battle climate change, because the solutions are technological, and the developed world has better science and research infrastructure. But this view is misleading, small solutions can potentially have a big effect in developing nations. Developing nations are just as capable as developed nations of taking on the burden of climate change, and must take the lead in dealing with the effects.</t>

    <t>Thank You for a timely response,I will first go over my opponent's arguments, then go back to my own.First, my opponent talked about how many countries are in debt, and are not in the position to mitigate climate change.However, Global warming could cost the world up to $20 trillion over two decades for cleaner energy sources and do the most harm to people who can least afford to adapt, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon warns in a new report.- USA today. Judge, 20 trillion dollars is the biggest number in this debate, and you have to look to our side for this argument. Not only that, but my second argument clearly talks about how mitigating the effects of climate change can increase jobs in the renewable energy field. Obsviously, since the benefits outweigh the harms, developed countries should have the moral obligation to mitigate climate change.   Their second argument was that developing countries are the countries who wil suffer the worst and the have a huge incentive. However, my opponent is misunderstanding that point. This is about whether these countries should have a MORAL obligation, and as the pollution of CO2 emmissions from these developing countries are going to be pushed to the devloped countries, we have a moral obligation to mitigate the effects of climate change. In the last quarter of the 20th century, the average atmospheric temperature rose by about 1 degree Fahrenheit. By 2000, that increase was responsible for the annual loss of about 160,000 lives and the loss of 5.5 million years of healthy life, according to estimates by the World Health Organization. The toll is expected to double to about 300,000 lives by 2020. Judge, if my opponent can prove that the developed countries don't have a moral obligation to save so many lives, and if he can show the justification of the deaths of so many people because of climate change, then they should win. If he cannot, you have to vote for the pro. My opponents last argument was essentially that developing countries are the ones with the better ideas. However, my opponent gives not evidence or examples backing this claim up, so it should be disregared.Now, to my side.First, I want to go over that adaptation is still an option. Adapting is always an idea. Vaccines which can save 9 million lives is a significant way to adapt, which will lessen the impacts of climate change, therefore mitigating the effects of climate change. Second, global warming can cause harms to the economy, such as a price tag of 1.9 trillion dollars each year by 2100. Mitigating the effects will enable us to avoid this number, and create more money and jobs.Third, my switching to renewable energy, we can stop sending money to terrorist groups, greatly decreasing their proft.Fourth, the enviornment can be greatly saved, saving millions of human lives as well as near extinct species.

<h>RE: I forgot to say first round acceptance—that is my fault. I ask my opponent simply doesn’t post rebuttals last round, but he can summarize his arguments. Instead of a rebuttal I will simply write my case. Please note that I didn't make an argument in Round1. Rather I made an appeal for a more complete, less biased definition of the term 'hockey stick' and offered Wikipedia as an objective source. So far, this request has been ignored. I will make my argument in Round2, same as Con. I will refrain from rebuttals in Round4 on the condition Con does likewise. THESIS: The mean surface temperature of the Earth has risen by 0.74±0.18 °C over the period 1906–2012. Two-thirds of that increase (.6C/1F) has occurred since 1980. This peak represents both the highest global temperature of the past 1000 years and the most rapid escalation. As a kind of shorthand, some scientists refer to the graphed geometry of this peak as a 'hockey stick' to evoke a rapid rise after a sustained period of less dramatic change. To the limited degree by which the image of a hockey stick can approximate well-established recent changes in climate, the Hockey Stick is likely correct.Science is not in the business of asserting truths about our world. Rather, the process of science is to offer theories, create experiments to test those theories, analyze and publish results, offer alternative theories that might falsify results.  Theories are then adjusted in response to critique, new experiments are created to test, and so on. The scientific method is a conversation, a continuously refocused and improved loop. To the extent that experimental results are repeatable and reliable, those theories are accorded increasing degrees of certainty. One example of a theory that has acquired a very high degree of confidence in the scientific community is the assertion that the last few decades have been the warmest of the millennium in terms of global mean surface temperature. Sometimes referred to as the 'Hockey Stick Graph' as a way of describing the short, sharp rise in temperature, data supporting this theory goes back at least to Jacoby amp; D'Arrigo 1989 [1] but received an increased degree of public attention after the release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Third Assessment Report in 2001, [2] which included a preliminary version of a Hockey Stick Graph reproducing the work of Mann, et al 1999 (MBH99). [3]What was MBH99? MBH99 was a study of 12 paleoclimatic indicators that illustrated a global pattern of annual surface temperature rise, demonstrating that temperatures over the previous decade were the highest of the millennium.What is the IPCC? The IPCC is a scientific body set up by the World Meteorological Organization and the UN in 1988 to provide comprehensive scientific assessments of current scientific information worldwide about the risk of climate change. Representing the consensus of 2500 unpaid leaders in the scientific community and 100 participating national governments, the IPCC is the single largest collective international scientific effort in history. The IPCC was awarded the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize 'for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change.' This is not to make an argument from authority or to pretend that IPCC findings are unimpeachable. However, if one wishes a careful and comprehensive summary of the scientific consensus, the IPCC is unmatched in the study of climate change, or indeed, by any other field of scientific study. Here is the IPCC Hockey Stick in 2001:Following the public attention given to the IPCC publication of the MBH99, there has more than a decade of reaction and response, including those studies provided by Con in his arguments. Many, many studies have expanded upon and, to a remarkable degree, supported the MBH99 Hockey Stick. When the IPCC released its Fourth Assessment Report in 2007, that body offered the following summary:'Paleoclimatic information supports the interpretation that the warmth of the last half century is unusual in at least the previous 1,300 years. The last time the polar regions were significantly warmer than present for an extended period (about 125,000 years ago), reductions in polar ice volume led to 4 to 6 m of sea level rise. Average Northern Hemisphere temperatures during the second half of the 20th century were very likely higher than during any other 50-year period in the last 500 years and likely the highest in at least the past 1,300 years. ' [4]We should note here that the AR4 assigns a probability to likely as greater than 66%.'the following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood, using expert judgement, of an outcome or a result: Virtually certain gt; 99% probability of occurrence, Extremely likely gt; 95%, Very likely gt; 90%, Likely gt; 66%, More likely than not gt; 50%, Unlikely lt; 33%, Very unlikely lt; 10%, Extremely unlikely lt; 5% ' [4]That is, the single most significant survey of scientific opinion up to 2007 asserted a 2:1 probability that the Hockey Stick was correct. To support these findings, the IPCC listed the following studies:  Jones et al. (1998), calibrated by Jones, Osborn amp; Briffa 2001 'The Evolution of Climate Over the Last Millennium' Briffa (2000), calibrated by Briffa, Osborn amp; Schweingruber 2004 'Large-scale temperature inferences from tree rings: a review' Crowley amp; Lowery 2000 'How Warm Was the Medieval Warm Period?' Briffa et al. 2001 'Low-frequency temperature variations from a northern tree ring density network' Esper, Cook amp; Schweingruber 2002 'Low-Frequency Signals in Long Tree-Ring Chronologies for Reconstructing Past Temperature Variability' Mann amp; Jones 2003 'Global surface temperatures over the past two millennia' Pollack amp; Smerdon 2004 'Borehole climate reconstructions: Spatial structure and hemispheric averages' Oerlemans 2005 'Extracting a climate signal from 169 glacier records' Rutherford et al. 2005 'Proxy-based Northern Hemisphere surface temperature reconstructions: Sensitivity to method, predictor network, target season, and target domain' Moberg et al. 2005 'Highly variable Northern Hemisphere temperatures reconstructed from low- and high-resolution proxy data' D'Arrigo, Wilson amp; Jacoby 2006 'On the long-term context for late twentieth century warming' Osborn amp; Briffa 2006 'The spatial extent of 20th-century warmth in the context of the past 1200 years' Hegerl et al. 2006 'Climate sensitivity constrained by temperature reconstructions over the past seven centuries'  And here those studies are graphed against MBH99:So we can see that most reconstructions since MBH have found the Medieval Warm Period to be even cooler than MBH99. None of these studies found that the MWP rivaled the last two decades for mean temperature increases.Since IPCC AR4 in 2007, there have been many more studies using increasingly large sampling sizes from increasingly disparate paleoclimatic indicators and geographies and going even further back in time. The more often the experiment is repeated, the more evident and less deniable the hockey stick becomes:  Smith et al. 2006 'Reconstructing hemispheric-scale climates from multiple stalagmite records'.

Since MBH99 and the IPCC Third Assessment, the theory that current global warming is unprecedented for at least a millennium has been supported by repeated, rigorous experimentation. To the degree that the IPCC represents the cautious consensus of Climate Change expertise and those experts have assigned a 66% probability to the data illustrated by the Hockey Stick Graph, the Hockey Stick is likely (greater than Con's defined 50%) correct.I'll offer rebuttals to Con's argument in Round 3.</h>

    <t>I forgot to say first round acceptance—that is my fault. I ask my opponent simply doesn’t post rebuttals last round, but he can summarize his arguments. Instead of a rebuttal I will simply write my case. The “issue” of the MWP Between 1995 and 2001, there was a complete revision on how the IPCC looked upon paleoclimate reconstructions. You could say there was a consensus—haha joke, funny. The MWP disappeared—it was considered a myth, a regional event, and modern warming was unprecedented. This change in views was influenced by one main graph: the hockey stick.   To understand the change in views, one has to look no further than the 1990 IPCC report. In 1990, the IPSS displayed the MWP as warmer than the current warm period, as well as a prominent little ice age (LIA). However in 2001, we see a steady decrease in temperatures—almost linear—and then exponential increase in temperatures near 1900. This was based on MBH 1998, 1999. Since then, debate has ensued whether or not these proxy studies are reliable. Criticism begins After the IPCC 2001 report, there was very little criticism of the MBH 1998 and 1999 reconstructions. Since 1999, it looked like smooth sailing for the hockey stick with official IPCC approval. But this began to change in 2003, when retired mineralogist Stephan McIntyre and Economist and statistical expert Ross McKitrick published criticism of the Mann reconstructions. The results of their study showed that the hockey stick curve happened as a result from poor data handling, obsolete data, and incorrect calculation of principal components [1]. Let me explain some terms. Principal components are, essentially, a weighted average of the original group series. These weights are chosen to maximize explained variance. MBH98 used these components to simplify both temperature and proxy data. Essentially, they shrink 1082 grid cells into 16 principal components. MBH98 described 112 proxies, 71 of which are individual and 31 are principal components computed from different networks of individual proxies, all of which contain more than three hundred original series. Mann never released how he calculated these, but 5 of the 6 of his groups were published in Nature through the Supplementary Information page. McKitrick and McIntyre both attempted to recalculate and reproduce Mann’s data. See, principal components only work when data was missing. Using the data directly from Nature and the IPCC, they found that a lot of data was missing. They attempted to contact Mann how he dealt with this issue—there was no response. After working long hours attempting to verify the tree ring data, they calculated the component value. They didn’t match Mann’s results. At all. After investigation of the errors, McIntyre and McKitrick (Mamp;M) found that Mann’s data suffered from large collated errors. McKitrick, after McIntyre sent him the data, found areas where one pair of series where two different columns had the same data for almost thirty years. After the research, Mamp;M found when odd data series—which had no place in the data set—were removed, the Hockey Stick chart disappeared. After the calculations, the MWP reappears and the 20th century isn’t so scary [2]. To further explain the issues Mamp;M found: “Almost all the NOAMER series selected for overweighting were of a single type and from a single researcher, Donald Graybill. The series were high-altitude bristlecone pine tree-ring chronologies… The sites were selected for “cambial dieback,” that is, the bark had died around most of the circumference of the tree. Graybill and Idso reported anomalously high twentieth-century growth for trees with cambial dieback, as compared with “full bark” trees at the same site.” (see [2], pg 41)  MBH98 recalculated looks like this:  As we can see, it was actually slightly warmer around 1400 than it was in 2000. Although the study doesn't measure anything previous to 1400, we see, at least, part of the MWP, and see that it is likely warmer than the 20th century. Indeed, what occurred was that Mann’s statistical techniques accidentally (as I presume no scientific malpractice was intended) weighted the trees with hockey stick shapes. This weighting was, in part, one of the large reasons why a hockey stick shape occurred. Spurious weighting amplified the warming result. In sum, the differences between Mamp;M and MBH98 are as follows: The cedar ring width series as well as principal component one—yes, these two things are the reason for the different results. For these data series, although Mann shrugs these changes as “conventional”, Mann changes his statistical techniques. The changes cause those datasets to be dominated by specific bristlecone pines which, as stated above, are anomalous. These pines are not considered good measurements of temperature. For a second dataset, the Cedar trees, Mann creates an extrapolation, unique to those 350 data series, and misrepresents the start date of the data series [3]. Yes, red noise an irregular statistical techniques always resulted in the hockey stick shape. Alternative reconstructions  Some reconstructions—who attempt to act as independent verification, but are part of the hockey team, have published reconstructions which purport to claim  “the 20th century is the most anomalous interval in the entire analysis period, with highly significant occurrences of positive anomalies and positive extremes in the proxy records.”[4] However, this view is challenged by the majority of the reconstructions published. Recent research using lake sediments in Europe have found that the MWP was likely 0.9 degrees C warmer than today. The study even comments on other literature, saying “several other reconstructions from the Northern Hemisphere also show [recent] warm inferred temperatures that were not as warm as the [MWP]”[5].   Other work, based in Russia however obtains data from elsewhere, relies on a vast array of proxies as well as historical evidence from writings. In many cases, the authors find that the MWP was warmer than the latter part of the 20th century. Furthermore, they find that the MWP and LIA was a global event—not a regional one as Mann and team espouse [6]. Work from the same year, by Esper et al. shows that the warming in the 20th century was not unprecedented at all—if anything, the MWP was slightly warmer than the modern warm period [7].   Graph from Esper et al. 2002.   Conclusion: I have presented evidence that: (1)    Early evidence opposes the Hockey Stick graph (2)    The Hockey Stick studies are flawed due to tree ring methodology (3)    New evidence, too, generally disconfirms the Hockey Stick graph     1.

    <t>I'll accept that challenge and thank Con for the opportunity.THESIS: The Mean Surface Temperature of the Earth has risen by 0.74±0.18 °C over the period 1906–20012. Two-thirds of that increase (.6C/1F) has occurred since 1980. [1] This peak represents both the highest global temperature of the past 1000 years and the most rapid escalation. As a kind of shorthand, some scientists refer to the graphed geometry of this peak as a 'hockey stick' to evoke a rapid rise after a sustained period of less dramatic change. To the limited degree by which the image of a hockey stick can approximate well-established recent changes in climate, the Hockey Stick is likely correct.I'll leave the body of my argument for Round2 after Con has had his chance, but we need to do some housekeeping regarding our shared assumptions.*****************I take exception to the proffered definition of the Hockey Stick Graph for 3 reasons:1) BIASED- When it comes to defining shared terminology, the offered definition should be as impartial as possible, preferably citing an objective source. Use of the word 'infamous' as the first adjective in Con's definition demonstrates significant bias. Here's a definition of the word infamous from Merriam-Webster'sin·fa·mousadjective \G2;in-fə-məs\1: having a reputation of the worst kind : notoriously evil  [2]If Con wishes to conclude that the graph is evil during the course of his arguments that's his prerogative. Obviously, we're not going to agree that the graph is evil as part of our common set of assumptions.2) INCOMPLETE- To simply attribute the graph to Mann et. all (MBH99) is to disregard the preponderance of data for which MBH99 is only an initial compilation. Dozens of subsequent studies have confirmed the 'hockey stick' geometry to greater or lesser degrees. 'Most later temperature reconstructions fall within the error bars of the original hockey stick. Some show far more variability leading up to the 20th century than the hockey stick, but none suggest that it has been warmer at any time in the past 1000 years than in the last part of the 20th century.' [3] *3) BURIED THE LEAD- Obviously, the defining element in any Hockey Stick graph is the post-1900 blade- the recent, sharp upturn. The point of the hockey stick is that temperatures have rapidly escalated over the 20th Century and have now achieved the high-water mark for the past millennium. Most hockey stick graphs document significant increases in variability correlating to older data, so the hockey stick has demonstrably less focus on subjects like the Medieval Warming Period (MWP) or the Little Ice Age (LIA) then on periods after recorded thermometer temperatures. To define the graph as primarily a description of the MWP or the LIA is misleading and ignores the central thesis of the hockey stick.We might also note that Con's definition is undermined by the Hockey Stick graph he provides. Con's definition states that the MWP is virtually non-existent and that there's no LIA, but both events are discernible in the Wikipedia graph and conveniently labeled.Therefore, allow me to offer a definition of Hockey Stick Graphs from Wikipedia, which should be more objective and complete than Con's personal definition of Hockey Stick Graphs.'Hockey stick graphs present the global or hemispherical mean temperature record of the past 500 to 2000 years as shown by quantitative climate reconstructions based on climate proxy records. These reconstructions have consistently shown a warming in the 20th century with the instrumental temperature record by 2000 exceeding earlier temperatures. The term hockey stick was coined by the climatologist Jerry Mahlman, to describe the pattern shown by the Mann, Bradley amp; Hughes 1999 (MBH99) reconstruction, envisaging a graph that is relatively flat to 1900 as forming an ice hockey stick's 'shaft', followed by a sharp increase corresponding to the 'blade'. The reconstructions have featured in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports as evidence of global warming. Arguments over the reconstructions have been taken up by fossil fuel industry funded lobbying groups attempting to cast doubt on climate science.' [4]*By way of example, here are a couple of additional graphs that qualify as Hockey Stick Graphs and which reinforce MBH99 data.Here's a graph from the a 2009 New Scientist article comparing 8 later which corroborate 2001 IPCC Hockey Stick (based on MBH99). Researchers from 24 countries spent seven years compiling data for the PAGES 2K project. They assembled 511 climate archives from around the world, from sediments, ice cores, tree rings, corals, stalagmites, pollen or historical documents and measurements to create the most comprehensive paleoclimate study yet.  Published this year in Nature Geosciences, this most recent and comprehensive analysis strongly corroborates the MBH99 Hockey Stick. Green dots are the 30-year average of the new PAGES 2K reconstruction. The red curve shows the global mean temperature. Blue is MBH99 with range of uncertainty.</t>

The following definitions are from Oxford Dictionary  Developing Country- poor agricultural country that is seeking to become more advanced economically and socially  Environmental Protection- Environmental protection is a practice of protecting the natural environment on individual, organizational or governmental levels, for the benefit of both the natural environment and humans. ...  Resource Extraction- Natural resources occur naturally within environments that exist relatively undisturbed by humanity, in a natural form  I value morality.  Arbor states, http://www.treesaregood.com... We like trees around us because they make life more pleasant. Most of us respond to the presence of trees beyond simply observing their beauty. We feel serene, peaceful, restful, and tranquil in a grove of trees. We are 'at home' there. Hospital patients have been shown to recover from surgery more quickly when their hospital room offered a view of trees. The strong ties between people and trees are most evident in the resistance of community residents to removing trees to widen streets. Or we note the heroic efforts of individuals and organizations to save particularly large or historic trees in a community. The stature, strength, and endurance of trees give them a cathedral-like quality. Because of their potential for long life, trees frequently are planted as living memorials. We often become personally attached to trees that we or those we love have planted. This means that trees make us feel at peace during our time on earth and help us with particular things such as recovering from surgery. Trees are like to us our mothers when we were young and were sick.  Arbor 2,  Trees alter the environment in which we live by moderating climate, improving air quality, conserving water, and harboring wildlife. Climate control is obtained by moderating the effects of sun, wind, and rain. Radiant energy from the sun is absorbed or deflected by leaves on deciduous trees in the summer and is only filtered by branches of deciduous trees in winter. We are cooler when we stand in the shade of trees and are not exposed to direct sunlight. In winter, we value the sun's radiant energy. Therefore, we should plant only small or deciduous trees on the south side of homes. Wind speed and direction can be affected by trees. The more compact the foliage on the tree or group of trees, the greater the influence of the windbreak. The downward fall of rain, sleet, and hail is initially absorbed or deflected by trees, which provides some protection for people, pets, and buildings. Trees intercept water, store some of it, and reduce storm runoff and the possibility of flooding. Dew and frost are less common under trees because less radiant energy is released from the soil in those areas at night. Temperature in the vicinity of trees is cooler than that away from trees. The larger the tree, the greater the cooling. By using trees in the cities, we are able to moderate the heat-island effect caused by pavement and buildings in commercial areas. Air quality can be improved through the use of trees, shrubs, and turf. Leaves filter the air we breathe by removing dust and other particulates. Rain then washes the pollutants to the ground. Leaves absorb carbon dioxide from the air to form carbohydrates that are used in the plant's structure and function. In this process, leaves also absorb other air pollutants'such as ozone, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide'and give off oxygen. By planting trees and shrubs, we return to a more natural, less artificial environment. Birds and other wildlife are attracted to the area. The natural cycles of plant growth, reproduction, and decomposition are again present, both above and below ground. Natural harmony is restored to the urban environment. This means that trees offer many positive benefits to humans.  Epstein, http://www.scienceinpublic.com.au... Life on Earth depends on plants, algae and fungi. For humanity, all seven billion of us, they are the major source of food, clothing, shelter and medicine. Our fossil fuels were formed by them. They clean our air and water, store carbon, and protect us from floods and drought. This shows that humans cannot survive without the plants that make up our environment. Even drastically changing the amount of trees and plants that make up our environment can be fatal.  Marine Conservation Institute,  Because the oceans are the largest ecosystems on Earth, they are the Earth's largest life support systems. To survive and prosper, we all need healthy oceans. Oceans generate half of the oxygen people breathe. At any given moment, more than 97% of the world's water resides in oceans. Oceans provide a sixth of the animal protein people eat. They're the most promising source of new medicines to combat cancer, pain and bacterial diseases. Living oceans absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and reduce the impact of climate change  This shows that oceans are vital for humans to continue to live on Earth.  Thus, the standard is decreasing harmful resource production.  C1: Resource Extraction harms the Environment  NATURAL RESOURCE EXTRACTION HARMS THE ENVIRONMENT. Liam Downey [associate professor of sociology at the University of Colorado at Boulder], Eric Bonds [doctoral student at the University of Colorado at Boulder], and Katherine Clark [graduate student in environmental studies at the University of Colorado at Boulder], 'Natural Resource Extraction, Armed Violence, and Environmental Degradation', Organic Environ. 2010 December, vol. 23(4):417-445. Moreover, because natural resources are the ultimate source of all the energy and goods we produce, consume, and throw away, natural resource extraction harms the environment not only at the 'point of extraction' but globally as well. Thus, the grave environmental problems associated with industrial production and consumption (in both capitalist and noncapitalist societies) would not exist, or would not exist in their current form, if industrial societies were unable to efficiently extract and safely transport vast quantities of natural resources.  This shows that natural resource extraction harms our environment we live in and we must reduce or get rid of industries in their current system of extracting resources.  ENVIRONMENTAL DESTRUCTION CAUSES EXTINCTION  Anne Ehrlich amp; Paul Ehrlich, Professor of Biology and Senior Research Scientist at Stanford, 1/9/13 (Can a collapse of global civilization be avoided?,Proceedings of the Royal Society Biological Sciences, Proc. R. Soc. B 2013 280) But today, for the first time, humanity's global civilization'the worldwide, increasingly interconnected, highly technological society in which we all are to one degree or another, embedded'is threatened with collapse by an array of environmental problems. Humankind finds itself engaged in what Prince Charles described as 'an act of suicide on a grand scale' [4], facing what the UK's Chief Scientific Advisor John Beddington called a 'perfect storm' of environmental problems [5]. The most serious of these problems show signs of rapidly escalating severity, especially climate disruption. But other elements could potentially also contribute to a collapse: an accelerating extinction of animal and plant populations and species, which could lead to a loss of ecosystem services essential for human survival; land degradation and land-use change; a pole-to-pole spread of toxic compounds; ocean acidification and eutrophication (dead zones); worsening of some aspects of the epidemiological environment (factors that make human populations susceptible to infectious diseases); depletion of increasingly scarce resources [6,7], including especially groundwater, which is being overexploited in many key agricultural areas [8]; and resource wars [9]. These are not separate problems; rather they interact in two gigantic complex adaptive systems: the biosphere system and the human socio-economic system. The negative manifestations of these interactions are often referred to as 'the human predicament' [10], and determining how to prevent it from generating a global collapse is perhaps the foremost challenge confronting humanity. The human predicament is driven by overpopulation, overconsumption of natural resources and the use of unnecessarily environmentally damaging technologies and socio-economic-political arrangements to service Homo sapiens' aggregate consumption [11'17]. How far the human population size now is above the planet's long-term carrying capacity is suggested (conservatively) by ecological footprint analysis [18'20]. It shows that to support today's population of seven billion sustainably (i.e. with business as usual, including current technologies and standards of living) would require roughly half an additional planet; to do so, if all citizens of Earth consumed resources at the US level would take four to five more Earths. Adding the projected 2.5 billion more people by 2050 would make the human assault on civilization's life-support systems disproportionately worse, because almost everywhere people face systems with nonlinear responses [11,21'23], in which environmental damage increases at a rate that becomes faster with each additional person. Of course, the claim is often made that humanity will expand Earth's carrying capacity dramatically with technological innovation [24], but it is widely recognized that technologies can both add and subtract from carrying capacity. The plough evidently first expanded it and now appears to be reducing it [3]. Overall, careful analysis of the prospects does not provide much confidence that technology will save us [25] or that gross domestic product can be disengaged from resource use [26]  Since resource extraction is harming the environment, and if the environment keeps getting worse due to resource extraction, the human race may no longer exist. All plants and animals will be wiped out and oceans will be ruined. Also, many resources needed for human survival will disappear  C2: Resource Extraction harms oceans. OIL SPILLS WILL POLLUTE ENTIRE OCEANS Allen, 12 (Greg, NPR, 'U.S. Watches Closely As Oil Drilling Begins Off Cuba', 2/13, http://www.npr.org...) There are big plans for oil exploration in the Caribbean, not far off the coast of Florida. A Spanish company recently began drilling in Cuban waters ' just 55 miles from Key West. The well is the first of several exploratory wells planned in Cuba and the Bahamas. The drilling has officials and researchers in Florida scrambling to make plans for how they'll respond in case of a spill. The U.S. currently doesn't allow any drilling for oil off its Atlantic coast or in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. One reason is what's at stake. Florida's tourism-based economy depends on its beaches, fishing and clear Caribbean water. Environmental Concerns The U.S. ban on drilling off of Florida, however, doesn't affect America's Caribbean neighbors. The exploratory well being drilled off of Cuba has many here concerned, including people like Richard Dodge. Dodge is the dean of Nova Southeastern University's Oceanographic Center in Dania Beach, near Fort Lauderdale, and what he's really concerned about is coral. At the school, Dodge and his graduate students raise staghorn coral in outdoor saltwater tanks. Live coral grow in the crystal-clear water, some just finger length. 'These are relatively new ones that we're starting out,' Dodge says. 'But over here, these are ones we'll be transplanting to the wild.' In another tank, large branches of coral will soon be used to help restore damaged reefs. Florida is home to more than three-quarters of the nation's coral reefs ' and they haven't been doing so well. Development and warming oceans have already weakened many. On a map, Dodge points out the location of what he believes is an even bigger potential threat ' the spot where Cuba has approved offshore oil drilling. 'The site that will be drilled,' he says, 'is only about 50 miles from Key West.' The rig drilling off Cuba's northern coast is operating in water that is more than a mile deep. But it's not the depth that concerns Dodge. In the case of a blowout, it's the operation's proximity to the Gulf Stream. 'We're worried that it could get into that stream fast and therefore, within days, impact our coastal ecosystem and coastline,' Dodge says. A spill could potentially affect hundreds of miles of beaches, mangroves and estuaries from the Keys to Palm Beach. Dodge and other marine scientists in Florida are asking the federal government to fund research that would help identify the resources most at risk, and develop guidelines to protect them. Embargo Could Complicate Cleanup Complicating matters is the fact that this new well is being drilled in the waters of a country that's under a strict U.S. embargo. Unless they apply for and receive special permission from the government, U.S. companies are banned from doing any work on the well ' even if there's a spill..  Oil is a natural resource, and this is one case in which people are worried that oil can ruin the oceans and the ecosystems that are very essential to Earth. And without these ecosystems from the ocean, the human race is in danger of extinction.</h>

    <t>I accept this debate.  I negate, Resolved: Developed countries should prioritize environmental protection over resource extraction when the two are in conflict. For clarification, I offer the following definitions: From Oxford Dictionary Prioritize- designate or treat as more important than other things From OECD Environmental protection- to maintain or restore the quality of the environment From Merriam- Webster Resource- a source of supply or support Extraction- the act or process of extracting something Observation 1: The Aff and the Neg must consider all types of resources in this round. Observation 2: The Aff must show that environmental protection doesn't require economic aid in order to win this round. The value for this round shall be country's framework. This shall be the value because a civilization cannot function properly without a good economy and austere social programs. This should be valued because it allows for developing countries to progress by having more and more in similar with developed countries. The criterion shall be strengthening a country's foundation. The criterion allows for the value of country's framework to be achieved because by strengthening the basic components of a country, we are creating a better framework for the developing countries to work on. Thus by strengthening a country's foundation, we can achieve the value of country's framework. CONTENTION 1: Economic development is necessary to solve many of the environmental issues of developing countries. Walter, Ugelow '79: 'The available evidence seems to suggest that environmental policy in developing countries remains comparatively permissive. The developing countries do have major environmental problems, but most of them are the product of poverty rather than affluence. Non-separation of storm and sanitary sewers and the use of open fires for cooking and heating, for example, serve to create environmental problems in developing country urban centers that rival the worst conditions in the advanced nations. Yet only economic growth can generate the real resources required to alleviate such conditions. This fact, together with myriad competing social needs far more pressing than pollution control, contributes to a generally permissive set of environmental attitudes in developing countries. Nevertheless, there is substantial variance among developing countries in environmental policy, partly because of differences in levels of development and partly because of differences in environmental preferences-and environmental attitudes have sometimes demonstrated rapid change. Past environmental 'disasters' like the dramatic losses in the Peruvian cotton crop after introduction of pesticides, the stripping of the Haitian mahogany forestand the ecological effects of the Aswan Dam in Egypt are not as likely to be repeated quite as readily in the future. In general, though, environmental constraints specifically in the extractive sector are not likely to serve as a major obstacle to growth of the industry.' Environmental protection is important; however, for developing countries to protect the environment, money is necessary and money comes from economic development. Resource extraction is a great contributor to helping the economy, thus resource extraction is needed in order to produce the money needed for protecting the environment. By creating a better economy, the developing countries will achieve the criterion of strengthening the country's foundation, therefore the value of country's framework is achieved.  CONTENTION 2: Economic growth is required to achieve environmental protection. Beckerman '92: 'The important environmental problems for the 75% of the world's population that live in developing countries are local problems of access to safe drinking water or decent sanitation, and urban degradation. Furthermore there is clear evidence that , although economic growth usually leads to environmental deterioration in the early stages of the process, in the end the best- and probably the only- way to attain a decent environment in most countries is to become rich.' This is a good time to go back to the old clich': the ends justify the means. A developing country can only protect the environment by spending money and resource extraction produces money. In the beginning, it may harm the environment, but in the end, enough money will be available to supply funds for environmental protection programs. Environmental protection shouldn't be prioritized over resource extraction because resource extraction is required for environmental protection to occur therefore resource extraction must come before protecting the environment. By growing the economy, a developing country can achieve the criterion of strengthening the country's foundation, therefore the value is achieved.  CONTENTION 3: Extracted renewable energy is correlated to less poverty, better health services, and improved education, such as cases in Sub- Saharan Africa. Kammen and Kirubi '08: 'After five decades of rural electrification, less than 5% of the rural population has access to the central grid in SSA, and new connections barely keep pace with population growth (TABLE 1). The patterns of regional energy production and consumption are far from uniform, however. North Africa is heavily dependent on oil and gas and the Republic of South Africa, on coal and nuclear power; in the rest of SSA, biomass (charcoal, fuelwood, dung, and crop residues) supplies 70%'' 90% of energy demand. The Republic of South Africa accounts for 50% of installed electricity generation on the continent. Moreover, energy use and energy investments SSA are clearly mismatched. Despite serving a minority, large-scale conventional energy sectors (electricity and petroleum) receive most energy investments. This is at the expense of the abundant, mature, and cost-effective small-scale renewable energy technologies, such as microhydro, solar energy, and improved biomass cookstoves. Many studies in SSA and elsewhere demonstrate strong empirical linkages between renewable energy technologies and a wide range of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, including reduced child and maternal mortality, poverty alleviation, improved education, and health services.' Extracted resources can help create better hospitals, better schools, and more jobs. Environmental protection may create more jobs but it spends more money than it can bring in and therefore cannot create better schools and hospitals. This is why environmental protection shouldn't be prioritized over resource extraction. Resource extraction has more benefits to a developing country than environmental protection does. In order to strengthen the country's foundation, its government must create better social services and create more jobs and this can be done better by resource extraction rather than environmental protection. By achieving the criterion we have achieved the value.  ATTACKS: The value: It is not moral to deny the citizens of a country better education, better hospitals, and more jobs in an excuse to protect the environment when resource extraction allows for all those benefits and in the end allows for environmental protection. Standard/Criterion: It states decreasing resource production; however, the con is extracting resources not producing resources, so the standard doesn't justify the prioritization of environmental protection over resource extraction. Also, when the aff's contentions don't decrease resource extraction but rather decrease resource production, the con's viewpoint remains untouched and the aff's arguments are atopical. Contention 1: 1)As I said in my case, resource extraction does harm the environment in the beginning, but in the end it allows for more environmental protection than could've been possible before and so the end justifies the means. 2)And are poor countries to stop developing their countries for their countries and therefore leave most of the citizens in poverty. This is not moral and therefore the aff doesn't acheive its value.3) I would like to say extinction is good and will offer the following arguments as to why: ' The version of progress enunciated in Hawking's story of cosmic colonisation presents a view whereby the solution to the negative consequences of technological action is to create new forms of technology, new forms of action.Does his mode of reflection pay enough attention to the irredeemable moments of destruction, harm, pain and suffering inflicted historically by human action upon the non-human world? There are, after all, a variety of negative consequences of human action, moments of destruction, moments of suffering, which may not be redeemable or ever made better.What we try to do paper is to draw out some of the consequences of reflecting more broadly upon the negative costs of human activity in the context of environmental catastrophe. This involves re-thinking a general idea of progress through the historical and conceptual lenses of speciesism the only appropriate moral response to a history of human destructive action is to give up our claims to biological supremacy and to sacrifice our form of life so as to give an eternal gift to others. From the outset it is important to make clear that the argument for the global suicide of humanity is presented as a thought experiment. The purpose of such a proposal in response to Hawking is to help show how a certain conception of modernity, of which his approach is representative, is problematic. Taking seriously the idea of global suicide is one way of throwing into question an ideology or dominant discourse of modernist-humanist action. [3] By imagining an alternative to the existing state of affairs, absurd as it may seem to some readers by its nihilistic and radical 'solution', we wish to open up a ground for a critical discussion of modernity and its negative impacts on both human an</t>

Con argued that 'This statement is false' in round 3 but why is it false? we can all see the graph for ourselves.We can see that on each peak, The left side of the peak rises sharply, and then there is a much slower decent on the right. the temperature of the Earth on the left side of each peak rises sharply, then slowly descends back down into glacial periods.Just because we are measuring a rise in Co2 and the temperature, doesn't mean that correlation is causation. Correlation is not always causation.The 3rd Graph might be based on data from the biggest super computer the world has ever known, that doesn't change the fact that they are not observations of the REAL WORLD. Someone wrote those models to support their own theory, and all of our Co2 centric models FAILED to predict real world events. That is why the IPCC can not explain the 20 year pause in warming, That is why Germany wanted to DELETE the pause in global warming from the IPCC reports.'Germany called for the reference to the slowdown to be deleted, saying a time span of 10-15 years was misleading in the context of climate change'. </t>

'The Holocene is a geologicalepoch which began at the end of the Pleistocene[1] (at 11,700 calendar years BP) [2] and continues to the present.' As you can see from the table ^ posted above, The earth has experienced temperatures far warmer than we currently are experiencing, and likewise has experienced temperatures far cooler than we are currently experiencing. And this is just in a relatively short period (geologically speaking) and within our current ice age.The Greenland ice sheet is thought to be fairly young, only to have formed in the Oligocene epoch, and most likely to have retreated and advanced many times. The beginning of this ice age is referred to as the time when permanent ice sheets were established on Greenland and Antarctica, thus the end of the last ice age was set by the absence of those permanent ice sheets.In summary, we know there have been five separate ice ages and within those ice ages there are multiple glacial and interglacial periods where these ice sheets have retreated and advanced.I contend that with all the geological evidence available to us, the Greenland ice sheets would retreat with or without the impact of humans. We may in fact be having an impact on glaciation, but regardless of that impact, glaciation would occur with or without us as it has for hundreds of millions of years.There are forces at work that affect our global climate far greater than the man made Co2 which is measure in ppm (parts per million)These forces include but are not limited to:Solar Output.</t>

    <t>This is a graph of CO2 concentrations and global temperature. If you look closely you can see that every time an ice age ends and the temperature starts rising CO2 levels lag behind a few hundred to thousands of years. This is a graph showing the same thing except for the years 1850-2000. At the year around 1975 a big change takes place in the way CO2 levels and temperature are related. Unlike in the past 400000 years where CO2 levels lagged behind temperature; starting around 1975 the CO2 levels rise almost Simultaneously. In the past 25 to 40 years there have been no worldwide effecting volcanoes, asteroids, or anything else that could cause that change the relationship between CO2 and temperature other than humans.Another element of evidence is that 'when climate model simulations of the last century include all of the major influences on climate, both human-induced and natural, they can reproduce many important features of observed climate change patterns. When human influences are removed from the model experiments, results suggest that the surface of the Earth would actually have cooled slightly over the last 50 years. The clear message from fingerprint studies is that the observed warming over the last half-century cannot be explained by natural factors, and is instead caused primarily by human factors. 'With this you don't even have to be a scientist to find that with no human influence it's incredibly different.Also even if CO2 isn't enough; scientists have found a new green house gas that produced by humans and is 7100 times stronger than Carbon Dioxide.</t>

    <t>Current weather modification programs should be banned because cloud seeding is a toxic, inadequate and unpredictable solution that may have disastrous consequences.  This debate is to help clear up the misconceptions about geo-engineering and weather modification (see last paragraph), and to call attention to the real problem: we are constantly, DELIBERATELY modifying the weather, and it's affecting the Earth's climate.  There are exceptions, but in general the artificial clouds formed by aircraft ('chemtrails') that we see are NOT from 'geo-engineering' programs. They are NOT from HAARP (suspicious as HAARP is, it does not create jet contrails, aircraft do). They are NOT from military experiments (though there are those). They are not intended to provide sunscreen (SRM) to reduce global warming (though that is proposed).  Artificial clouds formed by aircraft are PRIMARILY the result of the steam (super-heated water vapor) in the jet engine exhaust mixing with enough cloud condensation nuclei to form visible and persistent clouds. See reference [14] below.  The cloud condensation nuclei are MOSTLY water (relative humidity) in the form of tiny ice crystals (it's below zero up there) AND artificially-created nuclei. [4] This initial argument explains how it works, and why I think it's a very bad thing...  BACKGROUND 'Weather modification' is mostly cloud seeding for precipitation enhancement; that is, we seed clouds to bring more rain and snow to dry areas. (Other purposes are minor exceptions; e.g., breaking up hailstorms, a service insurance companies pay for.)  LOCAL governments globally (in at least 68 counties in 12 US states, and in about 50 other countries) hire weather modification companies to increase water supplies, and see this as a good value... 10 to 15% more precipitation at a much lower cost than other alternatives. [1] [12] This is important since nearly every large city in the world needs more water.  THE ARGUMENT While humans do need more water to avoid drought and starvation, weather modification (cloud seeding) is a terrible solution in a growing industry that has been underway for over half a century. [8] There are at least two huge problems with our current, ongoing weather modification programs:  1. We 'seed' clouds using extremely toxic flares (typically fixed to the wings of aircraft) [2] [7] that consist of silver iodide (Agl) and salt chemicals as well as strontium, aluminum, magnesium and other toxic chemicals. [13]  Millions of these flares are burned over our heads each year, dispersing invisible cloud condensation nuclei in front of and above the paths of incoming storms, most commonly at about 16,000 to 22,000 feet. [3] [4] [10] The resulting abundance of cloud condensation nuclei causes more and thicker clouds to produce more water.  Since these cloud condensation nuclei are aerosols (tiny particulates small enough to permeate a membrane), they cannot be contained and move up as well as down- anywhere the wind blows them. And because weather in the US tends to sweep across the states left-to-right... that is, eastward... when western states from California to Colorado seed the clouds with these metallic aerosols, they end up blowing across the entire country, enhancing cloud formation wherever they end up. And ultimately, of course, they end up in our soil, water and lungs.  And cloud seeding professionals cannot answer the obvious questions about their growing business: How many cloud seeding flares do we actually burn every year, and exactly how many would be a safe amount? [3] (Why would we ever think that burning these toxic metallic aerosols into our limited breathing space is a good idea?)  2. Water vapor injected into the atmosphere by aircraft fuel combustion (trillions of cubic feet added annually) bonds with these constantly-added CCNs to form artificial clouds. [10]  NASA tells us that the abundance and location of CLOUDS AFFECT THE CLIMATE MORE THAN CO2 OR OTHER GREENHOUSE GASES. [5]  Since we have been creating more and more persistent artificial clouds since the 1960s, we should be concerned with the worldwide scale on which this is now occurring. In fact, artificial clouds from aircraft ('chemtrails') were first reported by the DOT to the Department of Commerce in the 1970s, following which the US Congress declared 'inadvertent climate variation' to be a national security issue. That was in 1978, an important historical fact in analyzing current climate conditions on Earth. (You can use Google for more on this history.)  The constantly-increasing cloud condensation nuclei deliberately added to the atmosphere, combined with the increasing size and frequency of jet aircraft injecting more and more water vapor, results in more average global cloud cover. (Time-lapse documentation of this shows it clearly if you haven't seen this for yourself.) [11]  Why is that so important? If clouds affect the climate more than CO2, researchers should be aware that WE ARE MAKING CLOUDS and drastically affecting the abundance and location of global cloud cover. [9]  Unfortunately, climate researchers at large are unaware of our quiet but prolific deliberate weather modification activities. Even 'normal' cirrus clouds have at their nucleus 'mineral dust' and 'metallic aerosols'- the exact ingredients of cloud seeding flares. [4] Water vapor is a far more powerful 'greenhouse gas' than CO2, trapping and re-emitting heat. [15]  Clouds cool the ground during the day, but they also prevent heat from escaping at night, warming the air below. In other words, artificial clouds we are creating (jet condensation trails that persist and grow to form thick clouds) ARE AFFECTING THE CLIMATE. [11]  Remember: when we talk about 'climate change' we are referring to changes in WEATHER over time. Since we have been MODIFYING THE WEATHER in more and more locations, and with greater force of technology (and budget) every year for over half a century, we'd better look at this very critically. And scientifically.  And meanwhile, I think we should stop it.  IMPORTANT NOTE: Weather modification, which MOSTLY consists cloud seeding for precipitation enhancement, should not be confused with geo-engineering, which MOSTLY consists of proposed solar radiation management (SRM)- using sulfur dioxide, not cloud condensation chemicals.[6] SRM is a NEW idea proposed since the 1990s to counter global warming by reducing solar radiation, while cloud seeding with Agl started in the 1960s and has increased drastically every year, especially over the past 20 years.  If you want to debate me, please be sure to read through the documentation.</t>

    <t>On the topic of not underestimating the ecological crisis in comparison with the economic crisis.Firstly, I would like to point out the length of the ecological cris in comparison with the economic crisis. The existence of the ecological crisis is, ofcourse, commonly known. The latter applies to the economic crisis as well. Though, there is a significant difference in first noticeable negative change. The economic crisis started in the autumn of 2008 with the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers. The ecological crisis however is noticed much earlier. Being first of all initiated by the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain, the rise of Co2 in the atmosphere started rising, without stopping.(Note 1)In the following graph, the correlation between the rise in Co2 density and temperature rise can clearly be seen. This correlation is one of the fundamental dangers of the global warming. As recently pointed out by the IPCC (Note 3), the International Panel on Climate Change, this temperature rise is irreversibly caused by the human kind: 'Human influence on the climate system is clear. This is evident from the increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, positive radiative forcing, observed warming, and understanding of the climate system. ' (Note 4).(Note 2)To conclude, the ecological and economic crisis are evenly proven. Though, the ecological crisis is a much longer lingering problem, and should thus deserve more attention, concerning the more advanced stage the problem is in.Secondly, I'll mention the characteristics of the effects of both crises. When taking a look at the history, economic crises are common. Observe that the economic crises were always contested and overcome. This could be explained by the general incentive to develop a more sustainable economy. A period of welfare often follows upon an economic crisis, and vice versa. The traits of these cycle always differ, but are there.(Note 5)Notice that climate change is irreversible as stated in the IPCC document: 'Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen, and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased. '  (Note 4)This difference in the effects of the ecological and an economic crisis should be thoroughly considered when debating about this topic.Lastly, I would like to direct Con's attention to the following graph, where global economic growth of the past 2000 years. When you compare this graph with the former graphs, there is an obvious relation. The rise in economic welfare matches the trend in the earlier graphs. This indicates that the world financially corresponds with it's climate change. This correspondence can be explained by the general increase in world population, a result of the economic development, or for example by the rise in frequency of economic activity. Acknowledging that the ecological crisis is a forthcoming effect of the economical situation, one should always take the ecological status in mind when evaluating future development of the local or world economy. This implies that the ecological crisis should be considered when talking about the economic crisis. When combined with my first and second argument, my point that the ecological crisis should be higher prioritised than the economic crisis is logical.(Note 6).</t>

    <t>Here are my arguments for why I disagree with the statement that the ecological crisis, e.g. climate change, should be focused on more than the economic crisis.  First however, I would like to assert a few things. I do not disagree with the theory of global warming and I do not oppose taking actions. I am arguing that the economic crisis should take priority. Also, I will not be giving suggestions on how to address the economic crisis. For instance, stimulus bills, tax cuts, printing money, or any other actions a government may take to address an economic crisis. I will simply make the case that something along these lines should be done to address the economic crisis first. Lastly, while our economy is not necessarily good, the economic crisis is technically over so I will present my argument as being what should have been done in 2008 after the most recent economic crisis but as if that time was now.  With that being said, my first point is that the timing of the economic crisis is very short in comparison to the longer ecological crisis. There is much more time to fix the ecological crisis and it takes longer to address while an economic recovery can be done very quickly. That is why it is possible to solve both problems but to do this, the economic crisis must be addressed first. By using the methods I stated earlier, a speedy recovery can be made which will alleviate the pain of the economic crisis, and by doing so, it will open the door for a more meaningful approach to address climate change.  Using the following links, you will see that at the time of the economic crisis, government revenues dropped about as quickly as it's spending increased. Note how the revenue and spending changed around the time of the GDP changing. The significance of this is simple. The faster we fix the economic crisis, the faster revenue rises and spending goes down. With deficits down, there will be a greater willingness to spend additional funds on clean infrastructure, alternative energy, and investments in green technology research and development. This will be an even more efficient method of confronting climate change than in a slow recovery where the willingness to allocate additional funds to new green programs will not be present. A speedy recovery will quickly bring about this willingness and make a larger ecological impact in the long run.  At the same time, as this article shows. The economic costs of environmental regulations are significant, and for these to be put in place during an economic crisis would only exacerbate the problem. The positive impacts of these regulations are undeniable, but these should be implemented in a strong economy that is able to bear the burden of these regulations without jeapardizing our economy or economic recovery. That is why we should solve the economic problem first, because we can then move on to regulating the environment without causing a significant economic impact in a weak economy.  With these things being said, I will conclude by stating that while it is important to address the ecological crisis, it would be more prudent to solve the economic crisis first, before moving on to the ecological crisis. There is a huge amount of time before the full effects of climate change are upon us, while the economic crisis is here now. It should take priority.</t>

    <t>I made clear that my reason for not providing a suggested solution for the economic crisis is that that is another debate because there are so many options. However, it appears as if Pro would claim that my argument is invalid due to my not providing suggestions so I will elaborate more. There are numerous things the government and federal reserve can do to combat the effects of an economic crisis. First, a stimulus package of sorts that invests in infrastructure, education, AND some of the more minor environmental projects that can be put in place would make a positive impact on both crises while keeping the focus on the economic crisis. Second, governments can cut taxes in addition to stimulus in order to increase consumer spending. The Federal Reserve can do several things too. By keeping long term interest rates low, buying bonds in the process called quantitive easing, and lending to banks, the Fed can stimulate the credit market and get the economy going. These solutions have all been tried and have all shown some success. While there is debate over which of these to use, there are plenty of options that can be taken to promote growth. As for Pro's suggestion that growth must come by stimulating consumers. This is true of course, however, pro forgot to mention that all of the stimulus suggestions I made are designed to pump more money into the economy and into the wallets of consumers. Therefore, this argument is invalid.  Pro stated that the reason that my arguments are invalid is that they are based on uncertainty. This is not true. My arguments are based on the truth that there are steps that can be taken to stimulate growth. Even in the slowest recovery, the economy would still recover before the ecological crisis is upon us, and so my argument is not invalid or based on uncertainty. There is uncertainty in a recovery, but this uncertainty is based on how fast the economy will recover, not whether or not it will. The uncertainty is also mainly based on which recovery strategy is best, not based on if a specific strategy will help.  Whether a recovery is fast or slow, it will still be complete far before the ecological crisis is upon us. Because of this, I am baffled by pros suggestion that we should ignore the crisis that is already on us and instead focus on one that will not be fully felt for another half century or more. Yes, there are economically viable options that can and should be taken during a recovery, but these will not solve the entire problem. In order to fully solve the ecological crisis, there are many things that will have to be done including several things that would hinder a recovery. By solving the economic crisis using the methods I proposed, minor steps could be taken to fix the ecological crisis first, then when the economy is better, major actions must be taken to reverse the effects of climate change. This strategy allows us to fix both problems in a timely manner.  It is not a smart strategy to solve a distant ecological crisis instead of an economic crisis that is already here. The quickest and best method would solve both and it would involve addressing the economic issue first, and then the ecological issue second. This strategy solves both problems and it is clearly the most efficient strategy that could be taken.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank my opponent for his arguments and his first statement, which was really spot-on.Though, while reading his first argument, I couldn't agree with it. Con's statement that a economic crisis can be solved quicker than an ecological crisis is ofcourse valid. However, his solution for the economic crisis is unclear. I acknowledge that this debates isn't about the details of solving any of these two crises, but my point is this: as Con stated, many measures can be applied to possibly solve the economic crisis. While every economic crisis has different causes and effects, one can not rely on proposed solutions, hence the massive debates about the solutions for the economic crisis. And this is exactly the problem: for the economic crisis, one is not sure about the solutions; for the ecological crisis, solutions are reayd to be put in use. The point is that the governments need to adopt them. That being a side issue, if the governments put the economic crisis in front of the ecological crisis because it is possibly quicker to solve, this will only worsen the ecological crisis. The uncertainty is key for the economic crisis in contrary to the ecological crisis.Furthermore, on the topic of Con's second argument. I would like to notice Con on the fact that his second argument depends on his first argument: íf we fix the economic crisis, the measures mentioned in his second argument can used. This is, again, based on uncertainty. Directing to this article. The article states that the most useful thing one can do in times of uncertainty, is to be informed. That being said, the main area of the uncertainty in the economic crisis is the one of the customer. I believe that the economic crisis shouldn't be approached from a governments point of view, but from a customers. From this, one can conclude that the customers in fact are in the end the one to recreate or solve the economic crisis, whether or not supported by the government. To conclude, the uncertainty this argument is based on makes the argument almost invalid. For solving the uncertainty, this should not be by government spending or saving, but, as mentioned, but by stimulating the people/customers.Lastly, I would like to note that currently, enough ecologically safe options are available that are economically viable. Hydrogen engines in use for example do match their costs. The same goes for solar panels. The point is that as the technology improves, the viability to implement this in the current economic situation grows. This implies that solving the ecological crisis while being in a period of low economic activity is not only possible, but also economically interesting.Concluding, I believe that the arguments I put show that the ecological crisis is in fact the wiser option to choose when talking about priority. It is not only more urging to solve the ecological crisis in comparison with the economic crisis, but again, also economically doable. I hope Con agrees, and if not, I'm eager to see why in round #4.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank my opponent for his arguments. While going through his response, it seemed that some of his views were based on misapprehensions, which I would like to correct.First of all, Con suggests I disagree with his first argument because of him not elaborating enough on suggestions for solutions. I would like to repeat my last sentence from my first argument in Round #3: 'The uncertainty is key for the economic crisis in contrary to the ecological crisis.' By this, I meant that one can not be certain of effects of certain measures Con mentioned on the current economic crisis. That's the difference with applying measures for solving the ecological crisis: their outcome is certain in this current situation.Secondly, Con states that my argument of his argument being invalid because of uncertainty does not work out. In my second argument of Round #3, I believe I stressed enough that Cons second argument was based on the uncertain scenario of the economic crisis being solved, meaning his second argument is based on a presumption. I believe that the content of arguments should not be meant to be applied in a future moment, but in the present. The future is insecure, the present is not.Lastly, on his response to my first arguments. I'm of the opinion that Con responded insufficiently, taking my three arguments as a whole, and not responding directly to either of them.  Con states that the cological crisis is not yet upon us; I think I proved the opposite with, for example, the graphs and citations taken from Note 1, 2 and 4 in my arguments from Round #2. Furthermore, Con stated that my approach was to ignore the economic crisis. I think that I made clear in for example my last sentence, that I meant not to exclude the attention for one crisis from the other, but to prioritise the attention. I hope that Con can agree with me on the above. From my point of view, Con had not, in Round #3, adequately disproved my arguments from Round #2. For that reason, I suppose the outcome of the debate is for now, evident. As proposed, the ecological crisis should be prioritised above the economic crisis. I would like to thank my opponent for his debate so far. I await his entry for Round #4, and look forward to the Voting Period.</t>

    <t>First, I agree that there is some uncertainty in which methods will be effective, however, it is certain that the economy will eventually recover. It may be fast or slow but it will happen and so I disagree with Pro saying that when there is uncertainty in something then you should not do it.  Next, Pro suggests that I said that the ecological crisis is not here yet. That is not true, I said that the full effects of the ecological crisis are not yet here. Also, the reason I did not rebut Pro's first arguments was because they were not false. I clearly stated that I do not disagree that Climate change is coming and those arguments were proving that it was. Why would I rebut a statement that I agree with?  Finally, Pro never rebutted my argument that it is unwise to solve a problem that is already here as opposed to one that will not be fully felt for another half century or so. Millions of people are directly affected right now by the economic crisis and if we work to fix this problem now, we will be able to effectively combat the ecological crisis once the current suffering has been alleviated.  Throughout this debate, I have consistently proven why it is not a good idea to focus on the ecological crisis over the economic crisis and I hope that voters see this. Thank you.</t>

    <t>Utilitarianism is not a self-consistent moral system because utilitarianism is not moral in the first place. Since utilitarianism is doing the greater good for the greatest amount of people, we are forgetting about the minority. According to probe.org, ''utilitarianism cannot protect the rights of minorities if the goal is the greatest good for the greatest number. Americans in the eighteenth century could justify slavery on the basis that it provided a good consequence for a majority of Americans. Certainly the majority benefited from cheap slave labor even though the lives of black slaves were much worse.' Also, Adolf Hitler justified the Holocaust by using utilitarianism. He thought that in the end, the majority would be much happier once he had 'purified' the human race.  Utilitarianism cannot be self-consistent because morality is not constant. To be self-consistent, utilitarianism has to be constant. Situations are always changing and something that might have been moral once is not anymore. In different communities and areas of the world, morality is very different. In addition to that, morality varies from person to person.  Another reason why utilitarianism is not self-consistent is because it cannot uphold itself. Utilitarianism goes hand in hand with the quote 'the ends justify the means' and crumbles without it. Being self-consistent means to agree or be accordant with oneself but there are different types of utilitarianism, many of which disagree with each other. There is negative, act, rule, preference, and hedonistic utilitarianism. Negative utilitarianism is preventing the most harm from harming the most people while hedonistic util. is producing the most pleasure for the greatest number of people. Preventing harm and providing pleasure are completely separate things.  To go over my case one more time: 1 Util. is immoral  2 If morality is not constant, neither are the moral systems a) When situations change, morality does too b) Morality is different in different communities and areas of the world c) People have different opinions on what morality is  3 Util. is inconsistent a) Can't stand alone b) Different types disagree with each other</t>

    <t>'Europeans and Americans thought they were maximizing happiness for the Africans because 1) they thought they were already being overly kind to 'animals' and 2) the Africans were already being enslaved by other Africans and being a slave in Europe/America was much better than being a slave in Africa. Also, they were maximizing happiness for themselves because they could leave most of the hard work to the slaves. We know now that the Holocaust increased suffering, but Hitler and the majority of Germans believed they were maximizing happiness by ridding the world of lesser beings. So both these examples show the immorality of utilitarianism.'  You just completely ignored the definitions of 'moral system' I posted. And my opponent still continues not to explain how the Holocaust was 'minimizing suffering'. I also would argue that it is inaccurate to say that the reason these actions are immoral is not because of utilitarianism, but because of the inaccurate assumption that there are in fact 'higher' and 'lesser' people.  'The topic is 'Utilitarianism is a self-consistent moral system' but utilitarianism is not a moral system much less a self-consistent moral system. So although the debate is not about whether it is ideal or even good, whether it is moral or not must be involved for the debate to work. Again, the topic says 'Utilitarianism is a self-consistent MORAL system.' Utilitarianism cannot be a moral system if it is not moral.'  Yes, it can. I explained the definition of 'moral system' that I would be using in R1, yet you continue to ignore it. To reiterate: 'A system of ideas of right and wrong conduct; religious morality'  'Example: You are texting and driving and when you look up, you see five kids crossing the street in front of you. It is too late to stop so your only option is to swerve to the side but if you do you will hit one kid reading on the sidewalk. In this case, you only have to choices, hit five kids or one. Although it is neither choice is right, it is most likely that you will hit the kid on the sidewalk because you would be saving more lives.'  In a utilitarian mindset, yes.  Now let's change the situation. Instead of five kids crossing the street, there are felons and you are aware of that. Instead of child reading on a sidewalk, there is a well-known philanthropist checking the time so he doesn't see what is going on. Which would be moral? If you kill the philanthropist you will have saved five lives but the philanthropist is now no longer able to help more people in need. But if you kill the felons, you have no idea whether they have changed their ways or not. You may have destroyed five lives and families. In this case, neither choice is more moral than the other. You don't know which choice would bring greater happiness to more people and thus proving my point that morality is immeasurable and so are the moral systems.'  Here is the thing. If you change the premises, but keep the same fundamental logic, you are going to come to a different conclusion. Anyways, a system does not have to make a statement on absolutely everything to be self-consistent, unless you want to argue that climate change theory is inconsistent because it doesn't explain why gravity exists.  'Also, if something is meaningless without backup or examples, then I should win this debate because my opponent has no evidence, sources, or examples.'  BOP is on you, as I established in R1.  'This is unrelated to my point so this attack is void.'  It is not related, because both of the examples of subsections of utilitarianism only fulfill one criterion without consideration for the other.  'But if consistent means in agreement and not contradictory, the different kinds of utilitarianism must agree with each other to be consistent.'  This is not true. To apply this thinking to another situation: Say two people like cars, but one person likes Toyotas better than any other cars, and another person likes Hondas better than any other car. The two claims are inconsistent with each other, but the root idea of 'liking cars' is still SELF-consistent.  '3 Reliable; steady: Utilitarianism is not reliable or steady since the Holocaust, slavery, Stalin's genocides, and many more horrible things were justified using utilitarianism.'  These things can only be seen as utilitarian if one takes the view that there are in fact 'superior' or 'inferior' races (as the perpetrators did, but I do not, and I am sure my opponent does not either.)</t>

    <t>'You just completely ignored the definitions of 'moral system' I posted.'  I did not ignore the definition of moral system my opponent posted. I did not attack it because there was merely nothing to say about it. A moral system is a system of ideas of right and wrong conduct. That's great, that's wonderful. Now let's move on.  'And my opponent still continues not to explain how the Holocaust was 'minimizing suffering'.'  It minimized suffering because Hitler and the Nazis believed that they would be better off if they did not have to deal with 'vermin' anymore.  'I also would argue that it is inaccurate to say that the reason these actions are immoral is not because of utilitarianism, but because of the inaccurate assumption that there are in fact 'higher' and 'lesser' people.'  Hitler, although he was not a moral person, he was an amazing orator which is how he convinced many people that Jews were less than them. He justified himself by using utilitarianism. He convinced most of Germany that he would be increasing happiness and decreasing suffering by starting genocide against the Jews. Without utilitarianism, it would be much, much harder to persuade people to kill an entire race.  'Yes, it can. I explained the definition of 'moral system' that I would be using in R1, yet you continue to ignore it. To reiterate: 'A system of ideas of right and wrong conduct; religious morality'.'  If the definition was 'a system of ideas of right OR wrong conduct', then utilitarianism would be able to be a moral system without being moral. It would mean that a moral system could be a system of ideas of right conduct or a system of ideas of wrong conduct. But the definition is 'a system of ideas of right AND wrong conduct'. This means that a moral system is a system of ideas showing the difference between the right things we should do and the wrong things we should avoid. An immoral concept cannot be a system of ideas showing the difference between the right things we should do and the wrong things we should avoid if there is nothing right about it.  'Here is the thing. If you change the location, but keep the same basic logic, you are going to come to a different conclusion. Anyways, a system does not have to make a statement on absolutely everything to be self-consistent, unless you want to argue that climate change theory is inconsistent because it doesn't explain why gravity exists.'  I did not say that a system has to make a statement on absolutely everything; I just meant that morality is not constant since situations will change and there will not always be a choice that is more moral than the other or a choice that may have been moral before becomes immoral because of a change in situation.  'This is not true. To apply this thinking to another situation: Say two people like cars, but one person likes Toyotas better than any other cars, and another person likes Hondas better than any other car. The two claims are inconsistent with each other, but the root idea of 'liking cars' is still SELF-consistent.'  Utilitarianism is a completely separate idea than liking cars. Although two different claims of liking cars do not make the idea inconsistent, it does for utilitarianism because there is no root idea of utilitarianism. There is no such thing as 'just utilitarianism'. We are not even debating plain utilitarianism right now; based off the definition my opponent has provided for utilitarianism, we are debating about negative utilitarianism. If two different ideas of utilitarianism disagree with each other, it makes it inconsistent because there is no root idea.  'These things can only be seen as utilitarian if one takes the view that there are in fact 'superior' or 'inferior' races (as the perpetrators did, but I do not, and I am sure my opponent does not either.)'  Although, I do not believe in superior or inferior races and my opponent has made clear that he does not either, there are many people who believe so and like I stated before, a great orator, such as Hitler, can convince masses of people that there are higher and lesser people. There are many utilitarianistic extremists and they could start another genocide using utilitarianism as their foundation. So since there are still many racists in the world today ' some of who may be utilitarianistic extremists ' utilitarianism is not reliable or steady.</t>

In different communities and areas of the world, morality is very different. In addition to that, morality varies from person to person.'  To say something 'might' happen is meaningless without any kind of backup or examples, hypothetical or real. And while it may be true that different people follow different rules, this does not make utilitarianism inconsistent.  'Another reason why utilitarianism is not self-consistent is because it cannot uphold itself. Utilitarianism goes hand in hand with the quote 'the ends justify the means' and crumbles without it. Being self-consistent means to agree or be accordant with oneself but there are different types of utilitarianism, many of which disagree with each other. There is negative, act, rule, preference, and hedonistic utilitarianism. Negative utilitarianism is preventing the most harm from harming the most people while hedonistic util. is producing the most pleasure for the greatest number of people. Preventing harm and providing pleasure are completely separate things.'  Again, I stated in the opening that when I say 'utilitarianism' I refer to the idea that the most moral course of action is one that both reduces suffering and maximizes happiness to the greatest degree. Anyways, two different philosophies that stem for the same idea disagreeing does not make the stem idea inconsistent with itself.</t>

    <t>'Jews, gays, disabled, etc. are not vermin.'  I do not believe they are vermin which is why I put the word vermin in quotation marks because that's what they believed back then. In fact, some people still believe they are.  'How does this relate to utilitarianism?'  This was just a lead in to the rest of the paragraph; it was never meant to be part of the debate.  'The majority of people being convinced of something does not make it true.'  Since the majority was convinced, it was maximizing happiness for them because they had fallen into a pit of believing they were higher than the Jews. Hitler's lies became their reality and even after Hitler died, some continued being cruel to 'lesser' races. Once enough people believe something, it can become true in our society.  'Yes, it can'  How?  'It just wouldn't be an accurate system of ideas.'  Exactly. If we attempt to follow an inaccurate system of ideas, we will be messed up. It's like believing two plus two is five for our whole lives.  'You are saying a moral system must make a statement even when neither choice is more moral than the other in order to maintain self-consistency. In other words, if there's something it doesn't make a statement on, it is a bad system.'  My opponent has ignored my entire point where I explain how morality must be constant, not that it needs to make a statement on everything. Morality is immeasurable; it is not something you can compare something else against.  'You may as well have said 'utilitarianism is inconsistent because it doesn't tell you whether or not cheese or pepperoni pizza is better.'  This is not related at all to morality or utilitarianism.  As clarified in R1, I am using the definition that it is 'the idea that the most ethical course of action is the one that maximizes happiness and reduces suffering to the greatest extent.' This is a root idea, and one which excludes both of the examples you provide.  'The idea that the most ethical course of action is the one that maximizes happiness and reduces suffering to the greatest extent' is not a root idea because like I said before, that is negative utilitarianism not a root idea of utilitarianism.  'The definition is a mixture of both.'  A mixture of negative utilitarianism and what? Also, if the definition is a mixture, it is not a pure, root idea.  'Please refer to R1, where I explained the definition of utilitarianism that would be used for this debate.'  As I have stated multiple times, the definition is still not a root idea.  'The fact remains that to a non-racist these views cannot be considered 'utilitarian'.'  That is true but what I mean is that utilitarianism is not reliable because there is still a high chance that utilitarianism may be used for the wrong reasons.</t>

<h>Is there an environmental crisis in the US? My answer to that question is no. The affirmative side lacks the correct evidence to support this claim. Before we venture further in my constructive, we need to find out what a crisis is. The Noah Webster's dictionary defines crisis as, 'an unstable or crucial time or state of affairs in which a decisive change is impending.' Currently, unless I am incapable of thought, there is nothing horrible in which we need to make a decisive change. This is not just my personal conclusion, expert opinions and sources also support this conclusion. During the course of this paper, I will explain why there is no environmental crisis. To begin, I will discuss Alternative Energy and how the fuel we have right now is cleaner than ever. Then, I will discuss pollutants and how they are being controlled. Then I will conclude my constructive by reviewing the evidence. Fossil fuels are hydrocarbons primarily coal, natural gas and oil. These fuels are primarily formed from dead plants or animals over the course of thousands of years. Many environmentalists claim that fossil fuels will run out in the near future. They claim that we are consuming fossil fuels at such an alarming rate, that we will soon run out of them. Science contradicts, however. Based on a graph Professor H.D Maher Jr of the University of Omaha, the amount of oil has actually increased since 1994. It went from 539 billion barrels to 635 billion barrels. Also on the same graph, Natural Gas also went up from 90 BBE (Billion Barrel Equivalent) to 270 BBE. Clearly, we have not discovered all the oil and natural gas in the world; therefore we are not running out resources such as oil.  Many environmentalists claim that due to fossil fuels, the air is getting more polluted. However statistics disagree, 'In spite of the twentieth century's steep population rise, massive industrialization, and the nationwide proliferation of the modern automobile, the air we breathe is cleaner than it has been in decades. Data from the Environmental Protection Agency also confirm that U.S. air quality has improved since 1970,' according to Drew Thorley, writer for the Manhattan Institute. The EPA even agrees that the air we breathe is cleaner than before. What is up with the claims that emissions and air quality when statistics and the EPA clearly contradict? Even with this staggering evidence, Environmentalists claim that much of the technology that helps with pollution is very unstable. However many technologies involving coal, which is considered the dirtiest of all fossil fuels, are very stable and are actually helping coal greatly. Technologies such as Flue Gas Desulfurization and Low Nitrogen Oxide Burners are examples of this. The SO2, Sulfur Dioxide, removal performance of scrubbers has been reviewed. Data reflect that most wet limestone and LSD installations appear to be capable of ~90% SO2 removal. Advanced, state-of-the-art wet scrubbers can provide SO2 removal in excess of 95%... Low Nitrogen Oxide Burners reduce the creation of NOx, a cause of ground-level ozone, by restricting oxygen and manipulating the combustion process. Low NOx burners are now on 75 percent of existing coal power plants' says the NETL and NMA. These technologies are not only reliable; they are currently being used today. Petrogel, a technology developed by Dr. T.C. Chang, helps with pollution caused by oil spills. Here is how Dr. Chang described his technology, 'The difference with PETROGEL is its ability to absorb the oil, not the water, as well as more effectively release the recovered solid wastes. With PETROGEL, the resulting polyolefin/oil mixture can be treated as regular crude oil, suitable for the regular refining processes' There is no waste of natural resources and no pollution in the air or water' Not only does his technology help with oil recovery, it also conserves natural resources and adds no pollution in the air or water. Environmentalists claim renewable forms of energy such as solar, wind and geothermal energies are much better than fossil fuels. They also claim that not only are these energies unlimited, they also come with no repercussions whatsoever in the environment. Science once again contradicts. Solar energy has some very unique disadvantages. Charles Barnheart, lead author of the study at The University of Stanford's Global Climate and Energy Project, explains these costs. 'Batteries with high energetic cost consume more fossil fuels and therefore release more carbon dioxide over their lifetime. If a battery's energetic cost is too high, its overall contribution to global warming could negate the environmental benefits of the wind or solar farm it was supposed to support. Storing energy consumer's energy, and curtailing energy wastes it.' Not only are we wasting resources, the high-end batteries are consuming fossil fuels. The point comes back to the need of fossil fuels to power grids or power plants. The technologies to make solar power the primary source in which people gain power simply does not exist. Wind energy, which can technically function on its own, can be a hazard to avian animals. An environmentalist site by the University of Wisconsin supports this claim. 'Concerns are the avian and bat mortality. These creatures fly into the rotors of the turbines. Federally protected birds and bats near wind farms have raised awareness with the fish and wildlife agencies. Industries and their engineers have been busy however to improve these issues through more proper siting, insulated materials, and research on landscape and the organisms living there.' This can lead to extinction of these federally protected birds. Geothermal Energy Plants can cause earthquakes. Christopher Joyce of the NPR, National Public Radio, says that, 'A geothermal energy plant near the Salton Sea in California taps deep underground heat from the southern San Andreas Fault rift zone. A new study ties the amount of water pulled from the ground by the geothermal plant here to the frequency of earthquakes.' Therefore with these solid evidences I say that even renewable energies have its bad effects on the environment.</h>

    <t>Foreword to the Debate:Debates are both opportunities for idea sharing and competition. The competitive element of debate reinforces the desire of both parties to present well researched and logically sound analysis of controversial topics. We want to be 'right' about our ideas and views... but we also want to develop the ability to explain why we think the way that we do. Debate allows these ideas to compete in an objective forum. In this case, Con is not calmly stating a defensible argument. He is not making the case that, 'fears of a widespread environmental crisis are overblown,' or 'Many well-known environmental causes are misguided.' Instead, he is speaking in wild, angry extremes, and arguing that there are no negative environmental events happening anywhere in the US. The language that he is using is polemic, presenting an 'all or nothing' doctrine that is well known to students of debate as being impossible to defend. This position states that no 'horrible' environmental crises are happening at all... including naturally occurring ones that are not caused by human behavior, pollution or negligence. Even the infamous Koch Brothers would not go quite that far. The resolution is simply too broad and incautious to be defensible.   Is there an environmental crisis in the US? My answer to that question is no. The affirmative side lacks the correct evidence to support this claim.  The Noah Webster's dictionary defines crisis as, 'an unstable or crucial time or state of affairs in which a decisive change is impending.' Currently, unless I am incapable of thought, there is nothing horrible in which we need to make a decisive change.  He is saying that there are no environmental related crises anywhere in the US, because of air quality regulations by the EPA,  pollution capture safegaurds in the coal industry, and new oil discoveries. He also says that the flaws in electrical and geothermal power generation mean that there are no steps that we can take to keep our world clean. No endangered animals, no polluted waterways, no Superfund sites, no radioactive waste, no coastal erosion... and no natural events that negatively impact the environment, such as fire ants. Really? No environmental crises at all? He also suggests that the fuel that we are using is cleaner than it was during the Industrial Revolution. This fact, while reassuring, does not prevent wetland erosion from threatening New Orleans. It also does not replenish the honeybee population. At some point in the debate, Con will be required to admit that there exists somewhere a crisis that is harming something that is not man-made. There is a forest fire or flood somewhere, or a disease. He will have to admit that some animal somewhere is endangered, and should be protected. He will have to concede that oil is becoming more scarce in the US - and that deforestation is causing a loss of jobs. He will have to acknowledge that aquifers that provide drinking water to millions of Americans should not be jeopardized by toxic waste.  In short, Pro has taken on an impossible Burden of Proof in this debate. It cannot be argued convincingly that there are no environment related crises occurring in the US at all.</t>

    <t>Akay. I showed that there is at least one important environmental crisis occuring in the United States, and that environmental concerns remain relevant.</t>
<h>Singapore does not limit the number of vehicles per household. They do have a rationing system however. Yet that is not what we are debating. We are debating if vehicles should be limited by household.  I maintain that it should not. I have stated previously that the number per household does not have any effect on traffic or the environment. You continue to maintain that it does. Yet your links embedded in your argument do not back this up. You continue to reference that it works in Japan yet still you provide no documentation (one link I had to sign in to see, I wasn't going to do that, if it was that one I am sorry). The link to Singapore discusses rationing but based on income not household.  I still maintain that the number per household does not effect the number on the road at any one time. I could give every person 10 vehicles yet each person can only drive 1 at a time. If a person has a need for vehicle transportation that doesn't change depending on how many are in each household, even if that number is zero...they will simply pay someone who has a vehicle to take them where they need to go. The miles driven may actually increase under that scenario.  I will freely admit that vehicles cause pollution but I also argue that the economic alternative to a petroleum based economy can result in greater pollution. Vehicles increase a person's economic opportunities, resulting in a greater standard of living, resulting in more wealth...and wealthy societies can more effectively fight pollution. If you doubt that take a look at wealthy cities verse poor cities throughout the world. And it isn't cheap transportation that makes societies poor...its expensive transportation and energy that makes a society poor, or at least some of the main factors.  The Pro has not proved how limiting vehicles PER HOUSEHOLD will help her concerns about traffic and the environment. I have even challenged that her concerns are a problem. Yet even if a voter finds her concerns valid and overriding then I still do not see how her proposal will alleviate those concerns.  Vote Con.</h>

Since you have decided to make the debate more personal with name calling I choose to believe the latter until some evidence is provided.  I am sure that here in my home country of the United States that there are areas with greater numbers of vehicles per household yet less traffic than other areas with an opposite situation and effect. An example would be New York city (where many households only have 1 car if any) and any suburb of the same city (where there is on average several vehicles per household). Yet New York city has more traffic than the suburbs. I am providing no evidence but I trust the readers to know that this is true from their own life experience with any city vs suburb living.  Now I expect you to counter this with saying that people from the suburbs are entering the city in their vehicles and creating the traffic. Or, that there are greater numbers of people in the city...therefore more traffic even if they have less vehicles per household. If that is your response then I would say you are absolutely correct! This proves that number of vehicles per household is not a decisive factor in traffic that it is based on many variables and that your argument is simplistic and naive.  If your concern is the planet...and you feel like cars are the problem...then why not ban all vehicles? Or why limit by household? Why not limit by building? Such as each apartment building is allowed 1 vehicle for communal use. According to your logic this will reduce driving and therefore pollution.  On the pollution subject...do you have any data on how a car effects the environment? On how it contributes to global warming? If so please provide it. You may think it is common knowledge but if so then you should very easily be able to provide some facts.  I will say that if you eliminated all vehicles then the environmental damage would be even greater. As people lost the ability to transport themselves to central work locations then they would eventually resort back to a subsistence living of growing and raising their own food and burning wood to heat and cook with. This would lead to even more CO2 along with other particles released into the atmosphere. If you doubt me try this experiment. Cook a pot of rice in your home over a wood fire....then try cooking it over a gas or electric stove. You will find that the smoke from a wood stove will make your home nearly uninhabitable unless you vent the smoke to the outside. You will find that a gas or electric stove does not need to be vented unless you burn your food.  One last point. You mention traffic as if it is a bad thing. I think that is the initial thought of most people. They do not like traffic. I know I do not. However it is better than the alternative of no traffic. I know...that doesn't seem true or possible. But if it isn't the case then why do so many people suffer through it every day? They could simple stay at home and avoid traffic all together. Yet they do not...because they find it more rewarding to deal with it than any alternative that they have.</t>

    <t>Singapore does not limit the number of vehicles per household. They do have a rationing system however. Yet that is not what we are debating. We are debating if vehicles should be limited by household.  I maintain that it should not. I have stated previously that the number per household does not have any effect on traffic or the environment. You continue to maintain that it does. Yet your links embedded in your argument do not back this up. You continue to reference that it works in Japan yet still you provide no documentation (one link I had to sign in to see, I wasn't going to do that, if it was that one I am sorry). The link to Singapore discusses rationing but based on income not household.  I still maintain that the number per household does not effect the number on the road at any one time. I could give every person 10 vehicles yet each person can only drive 1 at a time. If a person has a need for vehicle transportation that doesn't change depending on how many are in each household, even if that number is zero...they will simply pay someone who has a vehicle to take them where they need to go. The miles driven may actually increase under that scenario.  I will freely admit that vehicles cause pollution but I also argue that the economic alternative to a petroleum based economy can result in greater pollution. Vehicles increase a person's economic opportunities, resulting in a greater standard of living, resulting in more wealth...and wealthy societies can more effectively fight pollution. If you doubt that take a look at wealthy cities verse poor cities throughout the world. And it isn't cheap transportation that makes societies poor...its expensive transportation and energy that makes a society poor, or at least some of the main factors.  The Pro has not proved how limiting vehicles PER HOUSEHOLD will help her concerns about traffic and the environment. I have even challenged that her concerns are a problem. Yet even if a voter finds her concerns valid and overriding then I still do not see how her proposal will alleviate those concerns.  Vote Con.</t>

    <t>That's so funny. You said that you only can drive a vihicle at one time. Of course that's right, but how about ur family? If the member of ur family is 4 - 6 members, does we need the vihicle in ur house until 4 - 6 vihicles? I totally disagree about that. The reason why I can say if we limit the number of vihicel in very household in a country, it can decrease the traffic jam in a country who legalize this programe. In Indonesia, Indonesia doesn't legalize this programme. And the capital city of Indonesia (Jakarta) from 24hours in a day, that 20hours there's happened the traffic jam and every household in Jakarta, they can have the vihicle 3 - 4 vihicles in every household. And because of this, Jakarta is the 1st rank as the biggest donatur of carbon dioxide in Indonesia. That's why, if we limit the number of vihicle in every household, not only decrease the posibility for the traffic jam but also decrease the number of carbon dioxide in the Air.  We know, Japan (Nippon) run this prgramme, and in Japan (Nippon) the traffic jam is so seldom. And why not we run this programme in every country in this world, so we can decrease the tic jam and can decrease the number of carbon dioxide in the air of this world and it's one step to avoid this world from global warming.

    <t>Actually, you don't know the tacitc of Japan Government to limit the vihicles for every household. Japan run this programme, and with this programme Japan run a new programme that they increase the number of public tranportation. Not only Japan, but also Singapore run this programme. because they know the impact if teh number of vihicle in they country increase extremly. It will give a lot of bad impact for they country. Traffic and global wraming are the only two from a lot of bad impact from the vihicle itself. The other bad impact, their country wil be so full because of this. And we know in every year, the number of citizen increase in every country, so their country will be full by the vihicle and the citizens.

    <t>Well, if you limit the number of vehicles per household you still do nothing to limit traffic. Each individual in the household that had somewhere to go before placing a limit on vehicles, still has someplace to go after limiting the vehicles. Someone will have to drive them. So, there is no change except life would be more complicated for members of a household.  I would also like to mention that it would punish larger households (such as ones with extended family or many kids) while single individuals would be able to drive as much as they wished. The limiting of vehicles per household would set off a chain of unintended consequences, such as people putting off marriage in an effort to avoid being without a vehicle.  If the limiting of vehicles will not change traffic then how would it affect the environment? I do not know that cars affect the environment but if they did your proposal still would not help.  It is very possible to be both for less traffic and a cleaner environment while seeing that your proposal will do neither...but the unintended consequences will be great. In addition it cannot be implemented in a fair manner.</t>

<h>Apology accepted, my friend! Let's debate!  My opponent essentially makes two arguments to support his position: 1) Evolution and life are too complex to have happened by mere chance and 2) Creationism (in the Bible) is logical as it fills in all the gaps that evolution leaves out.  First and foremost, my opponent's first argument does in fact do nothing to support his position. This is because: Even if evolution was wrong, that wouldn't make Creationism automatically right - there are more options. Correct version: If X (evolution) and Y (creationism in the Bible) exist. And X is wrong. Then Y is right. OK, but the reality is: X, Y, Z, A, B, C, D etc... exist. The lists for arguments for life go on and on, and on! Since we live in a reality where the second is more accurate and true, then even if X was wrong, Y isn't right. Thus, your position of Creationism is the most logical answer is not strengthened by flaws in evolution.  Having said that, I will still refute you. My opponent makes an appeal to ignorance (or at least appears to) in stating the evolution states that life, organisms etc... all came about my chance. The reality is almost opposite, although chance does play a part. The basic premise of evolution is: DNA can mutate - random and chance. But... The process of natural selection decides whether these gene mutations are useful to the organism and thus whether they should be kept. Natural selection is not chance, quite the opposite. With this, my opponent's objections to evolution crumbles, after this appeal to ignorance is revealed. However, I would still disagree with:  'How can a complete system like that have come about through random development? Simple it cannot have.'  even if it were true, because appeal to probability is another logical fallacy. But since this is not how evolution works, it does nothing to de-stabilize evolution.  I agree that Creation tell us X and Y, and Z did A and had the foresight to see B etc... That would be brilliant. But these are just claims and not supported by evidence. (If they are, my opponent has not shown any and the X is wrong therefore Y is right is invalid.) Not logical.  Now onto my contentions!  Contention 1:The distribution of fossils supports the Theory of Evolution. The Theory of Evolution predicts that as we move up the higher levels of strata, we should see more complex life forms fossilized, because animals will have evolved more over longer periods of time. However, the Argument for Creationism (should) predict that fossil distribution is random as bunnies were made with cyanobacteria which were made with mammoths which were made with homosapiens etc... OK, fair enough. But which does the evidence support? The Theory of Evolution. The fossil record shows the distribution as predicted by the theory of evolution. You never find mammoths with humans! I conclude that this fact (of the distribution) supports evolution.  Contention 2: Transitional forms support evolution. The Theory of Evolution predicts that because of random mutation and natural selection, we will see animals in transition from one form to another. We should see these in fossils. However, the argument for Creationism states that we shouldn't see any at all, because all animals were made how they are now. What do we see? Transitional forms, supporting evolution. 'From fish to amphibian: The fish Eusthenopteron and the early amphibian Icthyostega share so many characteristics as to constitute a virtual bridge between fishes and amphibians.' As an example. As I understand it, my opponent doesn't believe that we were all made in our current form (or kind, as my opponent calls it, though 'kind' isn't used in science) - so I am not using this against him. Instead, I am posting as a reference and to point this out to any other Creationists who disagree with my opponent. Contention 2 should not affect voting as it is not disproving Creationism as the definition agreed upon by myself and my opponent. Thank you.  These conclude my refutes and arguments. Thank you, I await my opponent's response.</h>

    <t>I need data about why some people are for and some are against global warming.</t>
<h>First may I apologise for taking so long to answer.  My argument is simple.  Evolution tries to teach that we came from a primordial soup of single celled organisms which changed and developed through a whole range of life-forms into what we are today.  When you consider the complexity which some organisms need to maintain in order to exist at all, one wonders where the logic lies in assuming that it all happened by accident.  Not only are so many of the creatures which we see around us, including some which are known not to have changed in millennia. Some are even called 'living fossils' because they are still precisely as they were when their ancestors were turning into fossils.  Watch some nature programs, or DVDs and what do you find? So frequently the presenter, scientist or whoever, speaks of design. Who can you have design in something which all happened by accident, by sheer chance? you cannot, for design you need a designer.  Another illogical element to evolutions as an explanation is the way in whihc so much of life on this planet is interdependent.  If it were not for insects, we would have very few plants, if it were not for Ramora, I wonder how well sharks would be able to hunt and eat with the tooth problems they would have, and those are just two simple examples, there are so many more, as ecologists are trying so hard to make us understand.  The interdependence is so great that our causing the extinction of so many species is threatening our own survival, and also affecting the weather patterns adversely.  How can a complete system like that have come about through random development?  Simple it cannot have.  Creation on the other hand tells us where everything came from and why, it gives us not only the origins of everything but the purpose of mankind.  It also shows that the creator had the intelligence to anticipate that the climate and other environmental circumstances, and build into his creation the ability to adapt to their surroundings and food sources.  The biggest example of that being that all of creation, including mankind was originally given fruit and vegetation as food, and yet, when it became necessary, after the flood those who needed to were able to adapt to a carnivorous diet.  Genesis 1:29, 30 'And God went on to say: 'Here I have given to YOU all vegetation bearing seed which is on the surface of the whole earth and every tree on which there is the fruit of a tree bearing seed. To YOU let it serve as food. 30 And to every wild beast of the earth and to every flying creature of the heavens and to everything moving upon the earth in which there is life as a soul I have given all green vegetation for food.' And it came to be so.'  The whole bible story simply expands on the marvellously intelligent working of the designer, and his amazing ability to plan, millennia ahead, and then make sure that his plans work out.  I look forward to seeing how my opponent counters the logic of these impressions of creation</h>

    <t>yes Good reason, no, simple, stupid, oversight. Design = creation. Accident = evolution. Reason.
So in fact I had actually written my round 3, simply neglected to actually submit it it. I talked about complexity of design, indicating design rather than accident, and therefore indicating a designer, someone who organised the appearance of everything we see.

To me all of this helps prove the truth of Scripture, and therefore the creation account, which if true can also only be the most logical explanation of how we got here. Again I apologise.

And when you stop to think that one of the things which humanity shares many of its DNA characteristics with is a banana, all that demonstrates is intelligent economy of design.

Allow me to narrow this down a bit further: '...design, indicating design'. I would ask my opponent to see my refute in round 2 to show this. My opponent, despite my refute in round 2 (which he appears to have ignored), is still making an appeal to ignorance fallacy by stating that evolution occurs through accident alone. My opponent's first statements are: 'I have to admit I am very curious to try and understand what alternatives there are in the creation versus evolution debate. Now, onto my opponent's arguments! 'I talked about complexity of design, indicating design rather than accident, and therefore indicating a designer, someone who organised the appearance of everything we see.'
In fact creationism makes no predictions whatever about the distribution of fossils.
The Theory of Evolution in itself doesn't try to explain where life came from, which is what [the ToE] I'm defending.
I thank my opponent for his arguments and apology; I accept the apology. My opponent appears to be saying that if DNA doesn't mutate then children cannot 'take place' [be born/conceived] because the DNA wouldn't be able to change.It does not. 'One thing my opponent appears to forget is that evolution is based on theories such as that expressed by Darwin which attempt to explain where life came from.'
It's satisfying to know that creation doesn't object to natural selection; but my opponent appears to be using this as proof for a Creator.
'The Earth has undergone many cataclysmic changes in its history.
'Creation, as described in Scripture merely explains the reason for that ability to adapt.'
For example, uranium decay, carbon dating, argon-argon dating, fission track dating helium, iodine-xenon, lanthanum-barium, lead-lead, neon-neon etc... 'Creation has no argument with DNA being able to adapt, though I do object to the use of the word mutate, because if DNA could not do that the birth of a child could never take place will stop since DNA changes every time a different type of cell needs to be formed to create that complex structure which is the human body.' I need not make a refute when no logical claim has been made. As he has not even attempted to refute it, merely ignore it; I extend my refute for that. It's true, however, that now the theory is being applied to try to explain how life originated (or 'came from', as my opponent puts it). This fits in with the geologically proved fact that the Earth was originally a single continent, and the geological layers were once flat, but are now tilted at various angles.
Creation has no argument with DNA being able to adapt, though I do object to the use of the word mutate, because if DNA could not do that [mutate, then] the birth of a child ((could never take place)) will stop since DNA changes every time a different type of cells needs to be formed to create that complex structure which is the human body.''
However, based on my round 2 and my opponents first claim, I need not do anything as it shouldn't affect the voting or debate in any way.
My point from round one, therefore, stands; that my opponent attempting to debunk evolution will not strengthen his position whatsoever.
So, this is like me making a fire truck that 'makes no predictions on how to tackle fires'. 'As for 'natural selection' creation has no objection to that either, because all [it] laterally describes is the process which the creator built into every creature to allow it to change to fit the circumstances it finds itself in. I need not refute this. ' </t>
    <h>Design = creation.' Accident = evolution. 'To me it is very simple, things either happen by accident, or they happen by design. Allow me to narrow this down a bit further: '...design, indicating design'. I would ask my opponent to see my refute in round 2 to show this. My opponent, despite my refute in round 2 (which he appears to have ignored), is still making an appeal to ignorance fallacy by stating that evolution occurs through accident alone. My opponent's first statements are: 'I have to admit I am very curious to try and understand what alternatives there are in the creation versus evolution debate. Now, onto my opponent's arguments! 'I talked about complexity of design, indicating design rather than accident, and therefore indicating a designer, someone who organised the appearance of everything we see.'In fact creationism makes no predictions whatever about the distribution of fossils.The Theory of Evolution in itself doesn't try to explain where life came from, which is what [the ToE] I'm defending.I thank my opponent for his arguments and apology; I accept the apology. My opponent appears to be saying that if DNA doesn't mutate then children cannot 'take place' [be born/conceived] because the DNA wouldn't be able to change.It does not. 'One thing my opponent appears to forget is that evolution is based on theories such as that expressed by Darwin which attempt to explain where life came from.'It's satisfying to know that creation doesn't object to natural selection; but my opponent appears to be using this as proof for a Creator.'The Earth has undergone many cataclysmic changes in its history.'Creation, as described in Scripture merely explains the reason for that ability to adapt.'For example, uranium decay, carbon dating, argon-argon dating, fission track dating helium, iodine-xenon, lanthanum-barium, lead-lead, neon-neon etc... 'Creation has no argument with DNA being able to adapt, though I do object to the use of the word mutate, because if DNA could not do that the birth of a child could never take place will stop since DNA changes every time a different type of cell needs to be formed to create that complex structure which is the human body.' I need not make a refute when no logical claim has been made. As he has not even attempted to refute it, merely ignore it; I extend my refute for that. It's true, however, that now the theory is being applied to try to explain how life originated (or 'came from', as my opponent puts it). This fits in with the geologically proved fact that the Earth was originally a single continent, and the geological layers were once flat, but are now tilted at various angles.Creation has no argument with DNA being able to adapt, though I do object to the use of the word mutate, because if DNA could not do that [mutate, then] the birth of a child ((could never take place)) will stop since DNA changes every time a different type of cells needs to be formed to create that complex structure which is the human body.''However, based on my round 2 and my opponents first claim, I need not do anything as it shouldn't affect the voting or debate in any way.My point from round one, therefore, stands; that my opponent attempting to debunk evolution will not strengthen his position whatsoever.So, this is like me making a fire truck that 'makes no predictions on how to tackle fires'.

    <t>I thank my opponent for his arguments, refutes, and closing statements. My final responses are below.  My opponent asks the question: 'Is the thought that evolution happens by accident alone a fallacy?' Yes. Please see my previous rounds. 'Certainly every theory of evolution I have ever read, and there have been a few, has denied any thought of design or deliberate direction, and that is largely because the minute you introduce deliberate design and / or direction you have creation.' I believe my opponent is clumping scientific theories with the more common use of the word. There is only one theory of evolution (that I'm aware of - and my opponent gives no reason for me to edit my belief in this), scientifically speaking. Other 'theories' (e.g., the 'Hovind Theory') are not scientific theories or, for that matter, scientific. They are, at best, hypotheses.  My opponent defends the idea of evolution being 'accident' by asserting that the process of natural selection is 'controlled only by the accident of the creatures being born into a particular set of circumstances.' I'll respond. a) Natural selection is its own master and is controlled by nothing - although its selecting process might be influenced by the organism's environment. b) It is not accident as much as chance. The two words have slightly different meanings - it's not an accident.  'We have a Universe which literally runs like clockwork, to the extent that NASA can predict years in advance when is the best time to launch a rocket to another planet.  Everything happens according to rigid laws. Did those laws simply evolve by accident or are the the product of a lawmaker?'  Laws do not 'evolve', as far as science can tell, laws of nature are the same, always were, and always will be. My opponent asserts that there must be a 'lawmaker' because there are 'laws'. Allow me to point out that the laws my opponent is referring to are called the 'laws of nature', so called because they are nature's laws - not made by anything (as far as the evidence suggests). So there is no need for a 'lawmaker'. 'Could that have happened by accident? I don;t think so.' I need not do anything here as my opponent confirms that this is just his opinion and nothing more. Opinion does not equal argument.  My opponent also suggests a sort of 'programmer' to account for the information 'programmed' into the DNA. Again, this just looks like an opinion, not an argument.  My opponent sums up the crux of his argument as follows: 'creation [is] far more logical than evolution since whilst creation gives us reasons for everything all evolution gives us is more questions.' Just because something gives us reasons doesn't make it logical. By that rather flawed logic, I can argue that because every religion gives us 'answers' then every religion is right. But they all contradict each other, outlining why 'it gives us answers' isn't the basis for an argument.  I thank my opponent, MadCornishBiker, for an entertaining and interesting debate. I accept my opponent's apology, don't worry about it! I also would like to thank the voters for taking the time to read this debate through.  Kind regards, J</t>

    <t>I did not exactly ignore my opponents refutation of the simplicity of the equations, but really there was nothing more to say to that.  Is the thought that evolution happens by accident alone a fallacy?  Certainly every theory of evolution I have ever read, and there have been a few, has denied any thought of design or deliberate direction, and that is largely because the minute you introduce deliberate design and / or direction you have creation.  Since most evolutionists deny the existence of God then there really is no alternative left. You either have a creation or you have simple accident and 'natural selection' which is controlled only by the accident of the creatures being born into a particular set of circumstances.  Creation means design, deliberate intention. Even the built in ability to adapt is deliberate.  But still, is creation the most logical answer? For that we have to look at much more than just animals, to everything in fact.  So what do we have?  We have a Universe which literally runs like clockwork, to the extent that NASA can predict years in advance when is the best time to launch a rocket to another planet.  Everything happens according to rigid laws. Did those laws simply evolve by accident or are the the product of a lawmaker?  As Ecologists are continually discovering to greater extents, this world is an ecostructure so man parts of which are interdependent. Could that have happened by accident? I don;t think so.  I do not see any relevance in what past cultures have believed, all that matters is what the observable evidence shows.  Not a bad interpretation of what I said but the point I was making is not that DNA mutates to allow for the changes in types of cells, but that it adapts according to a predetermined program built into it. Mutation is never beneficial, adaptation always is.  I admit I did not word that every well. I should have said that creation has no pick with what evolutionists call natural selection, simple as. My apologies for that, however it does not change my point . What evolution sees as natural selection is simply the ability to adapt to situations and circumstances to improve the chances of future generations. because it is designed in it is still natural selection, just not in the sense in which evolutionists mean it.  In a very real sense that is the crux of my argument, and to me it makes creation far more logical than evolution since whilst creation gives us reasons for everything all evolution gives us is more questions.  I thank my opponent for an interesting debate, and for the forgiveness of my error in missing round three, as well as for being gentleman enough not to take undue advantage of it.</t>

    <t>I will first address the issue of deforestation. My opponent states that we are taking out approximately 4.5 billion trees a year but at the same time replanting many of the trees we cut down. This does not account for the reported contribution to carbon dioxide emissions. According to (3), 'it is estimated that more than 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide are released to the atmosphere due to deforestation, mainly the cutting and burning of forests, every year.' In this same article, they also state that 30 million acres (121,406 square kilometers, 46,875 square miles) of forest are lost per year to deforestation. That would mean that not all of the forests we slash down are being replaced. The act of deforestation accounts for up to a third of the total anthropogenic carbon dioxide discharge according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC) (1). Another source that sites the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is (4). It states that approximately 1/4 of world greenhouse gas emissions come from tropical deforestation. This problem is worldwide. The effects of deforestation are due to not the replanting of the trees, but the removal of them, and in fact they do not contribute a large amount of oxygen to the atmosphere (2). The majority of O2 reserves produced by forests are used up by the creatures that inhabit them (2). I concede that due to the efforts we put towards reforestation, we help to mitigate the problems we are creating due to deforestation. These efforts only help in that they remove carbon from the atmosphere and mitigate the effects of the deforestation we are already committing. This does not stop us from committing the act of deforestation and it is still a problem that contributes to the effects of climate change (5). Global warming is the result of a rise in the average temperature of Earth's atmosphere since the late 19th century (6). The causes for global warming vary. My opponent states that global warming is a result of nature's contribution to Carbon Emissions and man has made insignificant contributions to the greenhouse effect. However, as (7) states, 'the global atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased from a pre-industrial value of about 280 ppm to 379 ppm in 2005. The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide in 2005 exceeds by far the natural range over the last 650,000 years (180 to 300 ppm) as determined from ice cores.' Even though we have taken measure to prevent the increase of greenhouse gases already present within the atmosphere, our contribution cannot be neglected. In (8) the graph shows the pre-1750 topospheric concentration of several gas compounds. It shows that in pre-industrial times many of the chemicals now in our atmosphere are due to man, not nature. These chemicals include many which were not around previous to the pre-1750s. In (9) a graph of the Glacial-Interglacial Ice Core Data is shown for the past 600,000 years. It shows that within the past 255 years the concentration of atmospheric CO2 has increased from 280 ppm to 379 ppm. While over the previous 8,000 years and before Industrialization in the 1750s, CO2 had only increased by 20 ppm. This can be shown in (9)(12) as well as the IPCCs fourth report. This almost certainly shows that man has had a significant impact on the increase of Carbon Dioxide emissions as well as other greenhouse gases(8)(10)(11, table 2.1). Now, my opponent has stated that the effects of mankind on the climate are negligible. The data above shows that this is not the case, and that Industrialization of nations is a direct cause to anthropocentric global warming. These are just the reasons for why man is one of the causes of global warming. There are also drastic consequences to the planet becoming warmer. These include various changes in weather such as an increasing amount of, 'irreversible dry-season rainfall reductions in several regions comparable to those of the 'dust bowl' era and inexorable sea level rise.' (13). This is just one of the results of abrupt climate change, as there are others. One of the problems that we face is pollution, which global warming contributes to (14). Pollution can be defined in this instance as the act of contaminating an environment with harmful or poisonous substances(15)(16)(17). There are many kinds of pollution and some of them are as follows: Air pollution, light pollution, soil contamination, and water pollution. The health effects of air pollution are egregious. Due to the insidious nature of many of the gases we release into the air through fuel consumption, industrial production, non-industrial sources, and transportation (18), we breath these in and they can have lasting health deficits for the living organisms of our planet. The top method in which particles are released into the air is through combustion. What is released in the air after this is not only water and carbon dioxide, but a host of other small particles and gases, include carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide (18)(19). These when breathed in have a wide range of negative health effects on human beings. The effect of particular matter including, ' (1) inhibiting and inactivating mucociliary streaming (2) killing or neutralizing alveolar macrophages (3) constricting airways (4) causing vasodilation and excess mucous secretion (5) causing changes in alveolar cell wall structure through abscesses and thickening which causes scar formation (6) traveling to other parts of the body, e.g., blood and heart.' (18). The dangers of Carbon Monoxide include poisoning and problems with the cardiovascular system (chronically). It is a result of emissions from fossil fuels and the burning of biomass. The impact of pollution on death is very serious, and strong correlations have been established between air pollution and death. In the Guardian, Professor George Knox wrote, 'Correlations with pneumonia deaths were exceptional. High mortality rates were observed in areas with elevated ambient pollution levels. The strongest side effect was an increase in pneumonia deaths.' (20). This is just an example of the many problems that can be associated with air pollution. Light pollution is another form of pollution that is a result of human activity. There are actual documented effects from that of increased lighting concerning its negative effects on animals, including humans. First and foremost, it is a use of energy to keep lights on at night. This is not only a waste of energy, but a misuse of it. When the energy consumption for lighting in the US is about 461 billion kWh in 2011 (21), it is no wonder you can see the lights very easily from the ISS(International Space Station) at night. To mention only the amount of energy we give to lighting would not do this topic justice, as there are adverse effects to lighting up the night sky. Not only does it prevent Astronomers from looking up and seeing the Milky Way, it also can have adverse effects on human and animal health and psychology (22)(23)(24)(25)(26)(27). There is evidence as late as December 2010 for light pollution increasing air pollution. Nitrate radical, which is destroyed by sunlight, is one of the chemicals in our atmosphere that breaks down smog and ozone. Due to the light energy emitted by Los Angeles, there are indications that there is a reduction in the amount of nitrate radical in the sky (28). Light pollution can also affect birds, sea turtles, and even salamanders (29). Light pollution is no joke and it is affecting our world. Soil contamination is when hazardous substances mix with the naturally occurring soil. It results when these hazardous materials are spilled or directly buried into the soil or move to the soil from a spill. Contaminants in the soil can hurt living organisms by coming into direct contact with the soil. For humans and animals they can also be exposed when they consume plants which have absorbed contaminants from their root (30). An index of all the various contaminants that can inhabit our soil is provided in (31). Many countries have their own criteria for soil contamination and often give values of the contaminants that are acceptable or that require immediate cleanup. For example, in China, soil contamination is a growing concern, and is only recently being addressed (32). Water Pollution is the result of natural bodies of water being contaminated by chemical, physical, radioactive or pathogenic microbial substances (33). Chemical water pollutants are atoms or molecules that have been distributed into naturally occurring bodies of water. Physical water pollutants are larger particles or physical factors such as temperature change, which can cause a variety of harmful effects (33). Common pathogens in natural water bodies are from untreated sewage and surface runoff from intensive livestock grazing (33). The problem with our food supply is not that of quantity, but of distribution. We have enough food to feed the world, yet they go unfed. This is a problem with the economic and political systems in place. This is a question of whether or not we can change our habits to fit the needs of the people worldwide. It is estimated that nearly 870 million people, or approximately 1/8 people, are chronically undernourished (34). Due to unequal income distribution and lack of resources, hunger prevails around the world. The World Bank estimated that 1.345 billion people live on $1.25 a day or less (34). In order to produce food, we need sound agricultural practices. These have gone out the window with modernization. There is a growing concern about the sustainability of the modern food production system 35). 'Evidence has accumulated showing that whereas the present capital- and technology-intensive farming systems have been extremely productive and competitive, they also bring a variety of economic, environmental, and social problems.' (35). I have more but there is a character limit I will comment with rest. =)</t>

    <t>Pro. The Rounds held a 10k limit. This is the highest I could set it, but is the limit none-the-less. It's poor conduct to post well beyond the limit, and into the Comment Section. I will reply to as much as the 10k Limit allows for.----------------------------------This does not account for the reported contribution to carbon dioxide emissions. According to (3), 'it is estimated that more than 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide are released to the atmosphere due to deforestation, mainly the cutting and burning of forests, every year.'1.5 billion tons of CO2 is only a number, not a statistic. By this, I mean it's meaningless. It equals only 1.5 gigatonnes.This makes up around 0.178% of all CO2 released into the atmosphere. This number is easily made up for by the current system, where (like in the US) Forests are getting larger, and are growing 42% larger than Harvest.(1)As we can see in the above image, while cutting down 2 trees make a one time deposit of 1,200 lb of CO2, the 3 tree replacing them will consume at least 12,600+ lbs in their lifespan. Your messurements on the number of forests lost only account for Deforestation, and doesn't take into account forest growth. It's simply a cherry picking. This can be seen in the US, where '215,200 hectacres are lost each year.'(3) The number's listed never account for regrowth, as again the US's forests are larger today than 100 years ago(2).3). The act of deforestation accounts for up to a third of the total anthropogenic carbon dioxide discharge according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC) Your sources is horribly wrong, as is your statistic.Human's release 29 gigatons of CO2 in the air. Around 3% of total emissions. Deforestation would make up only 5% of total Human Emissions, and again, only 0.178% of all emissions.(4) 4) The effects of deforestation are due to not the replanting of the trees, but the removal of them, and in fact they do not contribute a large amount of oxygen to the atmosphereOxygen has nothing to do with this...With forests larger today than 100 years ago, your argument is unwarranted. There are 400 billion trees in the world today,(5) If the US deforests 1 billion trees, and grow 1.5 billion, than after 50 years, the forests will be 25 billion trees larger. While 50 billion trees were removed, 75 billion were regrown. It's in investment profit, and the US's larger forests are a testiment to it's success.5). This does not stop us from committing the act of deforestation.In total, CO2 make's up a small portion of the Greenhouse Effect, with only a GWP multiplier of 1. Tree Deforestation's 1.5 gigatons of CO2 account for 0.0064%of the total Greenhouse Effect.(6)6) The act of Deforestation is not bad, nor a problem... It's only a problem if we aren't fixing it. I concede that due to the efforts we put towards reforestation, we help to mitigate the problems we are creating due to deforestation.case closed.Global warming is the result of a rise in the average temperature of Earth's atmosphere since the late 19th century.A total increase of 1.3*F.(7) With Human's making up around 0.28% of all the increased Greenhouse Effect, we are responsible for around 0.003*F. The difference in temperature from day to day across the year is larger. 7)the global atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased from a pre-industrial value of about 280 ppm to 379 ppm in 2005.That is irrelevant. Being the largest is as natural as being the smallest. We do in fact know that Nature can reach that high on it's own, therefore saying that it reaching that high makes it man-made is unwarranted. In the Mesozoic period, long before man, it reached 2000-4000 ppm.(8) 7000 ppm in the Cambrian Period. While this doesn't prove it's not man-made, it does make any claim that it's too big to be naturial unwarrented. 8) These chemicals include many which were not around previous to the pre-1750s.These man-made chemicals like CFCs make up around  0.072% of the total Greenhouse Effect. Equalling 0.00009*f increase.a graph of the Glacial-Interglacial Ice Core Data is shown for the past 600,000 years. It shows that within the past 255 years the concentration of atmospheric CO2 has increased from 280 ppm to 379 ppm.  You are bringing up simple numbers, but are not actually debating my argument with them. Increase and Descrease in ppm occurs all the time, naturally. Looking at the chart shown in R2, you will see how naturally the rate at which ppm increases and decreases changes on a regular basis. Just because it started changing 255 years ago does not mean it is man-made.Now, my opponent has stated that the effects of mankind on the climate are negligible. The data above shows that this is not the case, and that Industrialization of nations is a direct cause to anthropocentric global warming.The data above shows nothing more than how climate is changing, as it always has. The above data only makes assumptions about human involvement. No hard data specifically links human's to it.The data only says that climate is changing and human's exist, a case of Post Hoc. Throughout Human's existance, temperature and CO2 have risen and fallen, as is seen in the Roman Warming and Mineon Warming and the Little Ice Age. While they were not as large of an increase as the current, we have been through 3-4 warming periods, one is going to be larger than the others.These are just the reasons for why man is one of the causes of global warming. Are only reason's you think... Claiming an assumption to be fact is terrible debating. One of the problems that we face is pollution, which global warming contributes to. I will now show you the hard data... The first chart shows the percent of the Greenhouse Gas (with GWP multiplier added in, and baselines measured) while that second chart shows the percent of each that human's cause.GWP Multipliers are as follow...Water Vapor = 0.25CO2 = 1Methane = 21N2O = 310Misc = Depends. 9) The health effects of air pollution are egregious.People's health today is of far higher quality than any prior year. Despite Obesity, the overall Health of the world is growing year by year. In fact, obesity rates amoung children are dropping(10). Health is not a problem. 10) Soil contamination is when hazardous substances mix with the naturally occurring soil.Both Government and Large Companies use tactics for fixing soil and keeping land usable. This isn't an issue.and is only recently being addressed Therefore it's not a problem. Overpopulation implies we have grown to the point where we can not fix our negative influence.This also applies to Global Warming. If Global Warming is completely man-made, than it still doesn't prove we have begun Overpopulating because Global Warming is easily fixed.This also Applies to Water Population.The Pro must prove we have, without a doubt, begun Overpopulation and can no longer fix our negative influence. If we can fix our influence, than we haven't begun Overpopulating, we've just become wasteful.The problem with our food supply is not that of quantity, but of distribution.This does not imply Overpopulation. It implies we don't like sharing... If the World can no longer feed everyone, we have begun overpopulating it... It can still feed us... At most, it can feed over 36 billion people.The Resolution is that we have begun Overpopulation, not that we've became a greedy culture.It is estimated that nearly 870 million people, or approximately 1/8 people, are chronically undernourished The Pro, like so many, through around numbers, but not data. Is 870 million bad? Yes, but the number isn't relevant, the percent is. Since 1990, the population has increased by 1.8 billion, the number of hungry has decreased by 130 million.(11,12)The percent of hungry has decreased greatly over time, a sign that we are becoming a better species, not that we are overpopulating. The rest of the Pro's argument falls into the prior statements.The World Bank estimated that 1.345 billion people live on $1.25 a day or less (34).This is irrelevant to Overpopulation. The Pro is only bringing up typical social issues, not Overpopulation issues. The Mideval Times saw a tiny population around 200 million, and they had far worse unemployeement and pay. Same in the Roman Period. Social Issue =/= Overpopulation.The average person eats 2 lbs of food a day.It'll take half the food we are already producing to feed everyone adaquately. This is only a portion of what we can produce.The Pro has spent over 10,000 characters listing off fixable problems, miusreprented numbers, and irrelevant issues. Unemployeement, Low pay, Underfed... These are social issues, and they have been decreasing for centuries. While population increases, quality of life (food, paycheck, etc...) increase, and social issues (hunger, unemployeement, poor wealth) have decreased over time.With this, I conclude that not only have we not Overpopulating the world, but that we are growing as a civilization able to grow much, much bigger.I pass it on to Pro.</t>

Total number of plants planted would include this amount + all the other Replacement programs.Argument starts now.-Deforestation.Deforestation verb: To cut down and clear away the trees or forests from. What defines a problem is that it can't, or isn't, being solved. Most companies that deforest have a Replacement Program, obviously they aim to keep their product growing.After adding this gas in, with it's tiny GWP, it has a maasive effect on human's total effect on the Greenhouse Effect.How much?The US alone plants 1.5 billion trees a year from nurseries alone.This number also does not include the trees regrown in corporate Replacement programs, or volunteer programs.With only 0.28% of the total Greenhouse effect, human's are responsible for raising temperatures 0.003*F over the past century.With this, I conclude that Human's have not overpopulated the Earth.</h>

    <t>In 2011, our population reached a record 7 billion. This estimate shows that our population is higher now than ever before. However, this does not make it unsustainable. In fact, our agricultural systems produce, '17% more calories per person today than it did 30 years ago.'Yet, people remain malnourished and underfed. This brings to question whether or not our population is sustainable in a way that will allow us to maintain our current population, while also maintaining our environments and standards of living. There are several points I would like to bring up beyond deforestation, climate change, and food supply. These include but are not limited to the drinkable water supply, land, fossil fuels, renewable energy, impacts on global environments, cities, and population statistics. With 9 billion people projected in 2040 and an increasingly uncertain world, it can be posited that we are reaching a point of overpopulation due to numerous factors.</t>

<h>I apologize if my language wasn't appropriate for a debate. Can you give me some advices of something not to do..? This is one of my first times doing official debates.Because my English isn't that good, there are some points that I don't fully understand. I will summarize your rebuttals so that you may fix my understandings if I am wrong. (it's ok if the summary is only a little off and doesn't cause much misunderstandings)1. Warfare could not be solved because they are caused from from long lasting conflicts. The failure to stop wars isn't from the lack of intelligence but is from making irrational decisions based on their emotions. Learning from the past, it is better to make decisions based on emotions. However, at intense times, humans could pull their minds together and make rational decisions. 2. Humans had been learning from past mistakes and developing their sciences, achieving what is now an amazing achievement. The reason humans don't advance that much is because of human corruption and not the lack of intelligence. Also, the cost of space exploration is incredibly high. The technology humans have nowadays is a proof of intelligence itself. Scientific advance takes time. 3. Understood4. Current medical advancement is a proof of humans' intelligent. It could not advance so fast due to insufficient funds. Conclusion: UnderstoodMy rebuttals1. The failure to control emotions and let emotions control is a proof of our lack of intelligent. Looking back at the past, most conflicts occurred from emotional conflicts; most irrational decisions were made based on emotions. Not being able to surpass emotions, humans are no different from other animals; getting mad when hit or being scared when threatened. If humans really are smart, they should be able to intact their minds all the time and solve problems rationally, whether it's their daily life problems or warfare. 2. Being an intellectual being, humans should learn the fact that sticking with the current space exploration programs, the advancing of technologies would be slow. However, by changing the materials and goods used to build spaceships to other less expensive alternatives would be a large help to the advancement of the technologies. 3. It is humans' fault that the facts about global warming wasn't available in the past. If only humans are intelligent, the problem would have been known long time ago and easily solved before it gets out of hands. Also, protestants don't change the fact that nothing had been done to help reduce and prevent global warming. Something that would be more effective should be done instead. It shows that they are not learning from their actions. Humans falling for greediness is to blame the fact that they aren't intelligent enough to overcome it. Being able to control emotions would largely help humans become intellectual beings. Being able to control emotions is also being able to control greed. Without greed, things that aren't beneficial to humans won't be done and instead, only beneficial things would be done. The government slowly bonding to fight back against carbon emissions is so slow that by the time the have bonded and is ready to seriously stop global warming, the Earth would've become the Sun. 4. Many medical advancements didn't come from our intelligent. They came from mistakes. For example: Penicillin. Being able to advance faster than humans could in the past doesn't make them intelligent. Being intelligent means learning and adapting to problems. Nevertheless, being able to do it fast enough so that you don't die is also a must. Conclusion: Humans, no matter how many rational decisions they made, no matter how much knowledge they have obtained, as long as they still lose to emotions and greed, they are not intelligent. You could call this advancements less stupid, but not more intelligent. Only stating that humans learn from the past makes them an intellectual being, humans always advance, whether it's slowly or rapidly, not solving problems such as global warming because the knowledge wasn't acquired in the past, is not rational. Animals do learn. By intellectual beings, I agree with the given definitions. However, I would like to add that by being an intellectual being, it means that these intellectual beings are high in intelligent and is on average smarter than other existing species. (on Earth)</h>

    <t>Lets define Overpopulation.over'pop'u'la'tion noun: the condition of having a population so dense as to cause environmental deterioration, an impaired quality of life, or a population crash(1): Excessive population of an area to the point of overcrowding, depletion of natural resources, or environmental deterioration.(2): to fill with an excessive number of people, straining available resources and facilities: Now the generally shared issue listed is Population Damage and Environmental Damage.The world has seen overpopulation in terms of impaired quality of life many times, and the human race simply adapts and moves on. Are we too populated for our own quality of life? Lets do the math. New York City's population density is 27,550/sq mi.(4) I suppose you could say it's comfortable there. Very comfortable for some. The World's population is 7,101,513,000.(5)7,101,513,000 / 27,550/sq mi. = 257,768 sq mi.Texas size = 268,581 sq mi. With the whole worlds population fitting nicely in less a space than Texas, comfortably none-the-less, it's safe to say that overpopulation hasn't yet occurred in terms of quality of life.Now lets discuss Environmental Deterioration. Hmmm Lets think... Trees! Deforestation is a major concern, right? Wrong.The world deforests what amounts to 4.5 billion trees a year (I averaged between 3-6 billion.)(7) According to NASA, there are 400 billion trees in the world.(8) This means that the forest population could last around 88.8 years. That doesn't sound very long, does it? Think again. Actual deforestation estimates don't include the number of trees replanted. The US alone plants 1.5 billion trees a year from nurseries alone.(9) This alone increases the forest lifespan to 133.3 years. If the rest of the world planted 1/20th that amount per person, we'd be replanting enough trees to make the forest last 326.5 years. That's a little better. How many trees does the world grow, though? Well it's hard to tell. With Europe and (yes, shockingly) China, the number is far from small. This number also does not include the trees regrown in corporate Replacement programs, or volunteer programs. According to the UNEP Billion Trees Program, all the trees grown under the UN program equaled 2 billion in 18 months after launch.(10) If it kept up like that, we would see the program produce 1.33 billion trees a year. Has it kept up with that number? No. It's increased. The UN now plants 1.7 billion trees a year (12 billion total.) Between the UNEP program, and the US Nurseries, we replant 3.2 billion trees. Total number of plants planted would include this amount + all the other Replacement programs. Most companies that deforest have a Replacement Program, obviously they aim to keep their product growing. It also does not account for the trees that grow naturally on their own.How many trees do we think are grown each year, compared to the number of trees lost? Ask the US, whose forests are larger today than they were 100 years ago (when industry and war led the nation.)(12) The US's forest growth is 42% larger than it's forest harvesting. But what about Global Warming? Not an issue. The world as always gotten hotter for short periods. It's a natural process that helps burn up and refresh the world. I don't mean get rid of people or cities like in the movie 2012. I mean it helps to start Wild Fires and melt the ice caps a little. A very natural process. This time around, the warming process is hotter than ever before, not to be confused with being overly hot. Why is it hotter? Because of Humans? No. Humans mostly contribute to the greenhouse gases by adding in Carbon Dioxide. Humans only make up 5.53% of all the greenhouse gases.Well, actually. One thing everyone leaves out is Water Vapor. Gases don't have to be filthy in appearance to be a greenhouse gas. Water Vapor is the largest greenhouse, making up 95% of all the gases in the sky. With this added, Humans only make up 0.28% of all Global Warming. So what is causing this global warming to be worse than prior global warming? A growing Earth in general. All populations are growing, not necessary because of people. Global Warming this time around still is not hot enough to do harm, and if it were, it still wouldn't be because of the Human Population.But what about the Polar Ice Caps? What about them? They aren't really melting. Global Warming fanatics love to post pictures of the Ice Caps melting, but never speak of the ice cap growth. All ice melts over time, and it's only natural the Ice Caps melt to refresh the water and even the ice itself. For every bit of ice that melt, more takes it's place. The Ice Caps melt in the summer and grow in the winter.The Ice Caps have been growing, but for how long? All 33 years we've been studying them.(15) This mean they were growing when the Global Warning fanatics were just being born, and have been growing the whole time they've been shouting at us. Since we started viewing them, they've been growing, and have likely been growing long before. They have grown 26% since 2007. So while there is Global Warming, it's both natural and temporary, and is only slightly worse now than it was back then. Global Warming is, also, highly unaffected by Human activities, who only affect 0.28% of all greenhouse gases. The Ice Caps aren't getting smaller, and we aren't taking up nearly that much space. With so little negative affects on the world, Humans have yet to overpopulate. The Resolution is that Overpopulation is a current issue, but it isn't.When do humans start to overpopulate? When they can not prevent the negative effect we have. Tearing down 4.5 billion tree a year is a negative effect, but we can and are preventing it's effect with our own programs. If we get to a point where we can't undo our annual impact (which is very small right now) and the impact left over after all our attempts are (more than damaging) deadly to the Earth, than we are overpopulated.As of right now, the Resolution does not hold up. Right now, Overpopulation is not a concern.</t>

    <t>A FF, I shall carry on with another set of arguments for fun!Food Supply.If everyone ate around average (2lb a day) than it would take 2,584,400,000 tons to feed them.That's good, because the world produces up to 4,000,000,000 tons of food. We could feed 11,000,000,000 people. The UN doesn't think we'll reach that many by the end of TWO century from now (start of 2300). (b) This is good because you can feed that many people with just the land we are using for farms. Another good thing is that most city and town expansions do not intrude on the farm land we use. Most farmers in the world aren't using up-to-date technology either. The UN's High Estimate is merely an extreme assumption. They stick with the Medium Assumption.It's important to remember that as population grows, so does farming technology and the number of farmers.ANOTHER factor... Arable Land.They believe 10.43% of all land is Arable.(c) Of all that land, they estimate only 37.5% of all Arable land is being used.(d) This means we could increase our population to 266.6% before needing a new way of farming (or better Technology, you have to remember that as time goes by, and number of people one acre can feed increases.) This is assuming we still throw away half our food. If we stopped throwing away so much food, we could increase our population to 514%. Of course some of that land is likely being used. No more than 30%. You see, Urbanized areas (Cities, Towns, Villages) take up 3% of Earth's land...(e,f) If all of the Urban Areas was, by some odd chance, on Arable land, it would cover 28.76% of all Arable Land. Leaving 33.74% left open. This means you could still almost double the population (assuming technology doesn't increase and Urbanization growth doesn't take up more Arable land.) Of course it's highly unlikely urban areas take up that much Arable Land. In fact, the 10.43% of the land that's Arable might exclude urban land, but I'm not sure. To put this into realization for you... Off of open Arable Land, we could hold a population from... (I'm posting the year the UN's High Estimate believe we will reach this number.)2175 = 18,888,660,000 (if we wasted half of our food still.)2300 = 36,538,000,000 (if we used all our food by then)Again, the dates are based on UN High Estimate, and the population is assuming we are using the same technology. It also assumes the same portion of Farmers are using up-to-date technology. Under the UN's actual estimate, we won't reach that number until LONG after 2300, if ever.By the way, some say it would take 10 earth's to sustain life if everyone were like Americans. I did the math... It'd take us not throwing away half our food, and increasing farming to 140%. Does that seem like a lot? To an extant... But that increase would leave Earth with 47.5% of it's Arable land left. That is far from needing 10 Earths... In fact, if each earth had the same amount of Arable land, it'd take 4.75% of that much land to feed everyone the same amount Americans eat.(g) We could still double+ our population.Current Food Production = Around 5 bn tons.Production need to eat like Americans = 7 bn tons. Of course, not everyone eats like an American, and America's eating problem is fixable. Only when you can't fix the problems, have Human begun to overpopulate.With this, I conclude my prior statement.</t>

    <t>First off, I would like to provide a wider range of definitions of intelligence that you have provided; yes, intelligent beings are often described as needing to be able to solve problems head on, but it is far larger than that. Intelligence can be described as (per dictionary.com) the 'capacity for learning, reasoning, understanding, and similar forms of mental activity; aptitude in grasping truths, relationships, facts, meanings, ect.'. Whilst the ability to solve problems comes under some of the definitions provided, it also entails communication, speech, self-awareness and the ability to learn.  But with that said, onto the rebuttals;  1. They cannot solve problems like warfare - Often times, problems such as conflict and warfare cannot be sorted out by simple communication and diplomacy, as much as we would want. Warfare comes about by a number of reasons, often long standing tensions, such as what happened in both of the World Wars. The failure to make peace with the perceived enemy often chalks up, not our disability to make intellectual peace, but to make emotional war. Humans are animals, and like a number of animals, not only do our brain make rational decisions, but our emotions make irrational decisions. Emotions are the feeling often dissociated with rational, intelligent thoughts, and the way we evolved, as animals, often dictates that we should use emotion, not intelligence, as our prime mover, despite the fact that the intelligence is still there. Think about times during which warfare could of perceivably broken out (the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Berlin Blockade, ect.), and think of the damage that could of been done. Even in times of heightened emotion, humans can pull together, and use what they learnt, discern the facts, and come to a completely rational, intelligent compromise.  2. Our inability to explore space - This argument essentially fails to realize that space exploration is incredibly expensive and dangerous. Our ability to advance so far is an achievement within itself, but our lack of knowledge about said exploration is lacking. This, however, doesn't mean we're not intelligent, for as I stated before, intelligence is also the ability to learn, and that is what we have been able to do; learn from previous mistakes and build on them. Our scientific achievements, whilst obscured by governments in the past (the European dark ages for instance) chalks down more to human corruption (emotion) than it does to our lack of intelligence. Besides, would you be saying that we aren't intelligent if, in the future, we made advanced spaceships and planetary colonisers; scientific advance just takes time.  3. Humans destroying nature - I would like to say, before the modern age (1800 to now), the popular conciousness didn't know of global warming, or the far reaching effects of pollution; but as I've said before, lack of knowledge doesn't equal lack of intelligence. Today, thousands of people are protesting against large scale pollution caused by corporations, but our failure to do anything comes down to emotional corruption, caused by the greed of people and corporations (but let's not get into that). As I have already stated, emotions, and the ability to control them, would not make us any more intelligent than we could presently be, and would, in theory, make us less human (but again, let's not get into that). Governments around the world, together, right now, are bonding together to fight back against carbon emissions and global warming. This togetherness, this ability to (attempt) to solve problems, is something that is said to be defining attribute for intelligence, and our disability to completely solve it today can be chalked up to our complete misunderstanding and lack of foreknowledge in the past.  4. Medical advances - This could possibly be rebutted with the same arguments put out by the 'space exploration' rebuttal, but contains language that needs to be looked into. As I stated before, our lack of scientific advance in the past doesn't mean we are any less intelligent, and the fact that today we are advancing more quickly than ever before is a testament to our intelligence, not a detriment. The fact that you bring up human cloning is an interesting point, and is more of a moral debate, especially after stating they would be used for harvesting internal organs; something of which is going to be completely unnecessary in a few years, due to the advent of 3D printing, and the advances into the bio-engineering of internal organs.  Conclusion - Humans, no matter how emotional we get, no matter how much knowledge we lack, we still are intelligent beings, especially today, with the advent of technologies and innovations in all field of life that were not thought possible 10 years ago. Our progress today is a testament to our intellect, with the ability to cure many diseases, solve problems peacefully through international co-operation, and our opening advances into a new age of space exploration is truly a mark of our true intelligence.</t>

    <t>Wow, my computer has been acting up lately, but I'm back for some rebuttals;  1. Failure to control emotions - Your criticism of our failure to control our emotions is a noted one, but it doesn't make sense when you get down to the core of it. Since when did humans have to control our emotions all the time to be considered intelligent. Throughout history, extremely intelligent men and women have made blunders, but that doesn't mean we lack intelligence. Intelligence can still be compatible with emotions, such as in the case of brutality. I don't want to get to graphic here, but if you have a victim (for any reason), it would be more intelligent to gang up on them than to go in alone. This emotional response is wrong on almost all accounts, but as already stated; intelligence comprises of many factors, including working together, for right or for wrong.  2. Space and technology - I agree, staying with our current models and technologies of space exploration would make our push away from Earth far slower over time, but you also must remember, we still need to discover, produce (on a mass scale) and sell these future technologies. Materials such as carbon nano-tubes have taken years to create, and it will be even more years before we can actually create them on a mass scale. Using our intellect and combined knowledge, we will be able to achieve this in far fewer years than ever before.  3. Global warming - I get the point you're trying to make, but humans had the knowledge they were limited to before the evidence for global warming began to appear in the 1950's. If we did not have the knowledge beforehand, we would never of known what could, or could not have happened. This is the same as the nuclear bomb; debate raged over what the bomb could do, and it would be humans first testing of it in 1945 in which we finally found out. Whilst this didn't stop us from dropping the bomb on Japan, we have been able to learn from these mistakes, and since WW2, we have been able to avoid nuclear war, using our knowledge and intellect. We now have the knowledge and intelligence to be able to bind together and stop global warming in very much the same manner as avoiding nuclear war since 1945.  My final thought on this point is that governments are combining quickly to put an end to climate change and the runaway greenhouse effect. The Kyoto protocol has been in effect since 1997, and in that time, the vast majority of nation-states have joined (with either binding or non-binding) targets of ending global warming. The same goes with the internal USA; whilst the government may support growth of the polluting corporations, the majority of citizens within the US do want to protect and defend the environment. Just because a minority of humans are 'not intelligent' doesn't mean the rest are.  4. Medical advances - Yes, many advances have occured by accident, but a large amount has not. Take Louis Pasteur for instance; his advances in the field of micro-biology, vaccines and medicine have significantly improved the health and well-being of men, women and children across the globe. Taking the knowledge and information he had been given, he used his intellect to make significant leaps forward for the human race. Whilst his story may only be one, it is one of many, as thousands, if not millions of humans throughout history have been able to set aside differences and work together, using the knowledge they had available, and advance as a species using their collective intelligence.  Conclusion - Intelligence comes in many forms, either for good or for bad, it encompasses many aspects. From the deceleration of a war, to the ability to work together to advance humans overall well-being, we use our collective knowledge and intelligence to move forward everyday. And whilst some, the vast minority for instance, may have other plans for our world and our species, I can assure you that the vast majority is ready and willing to actually use the organ between their ears and progress.</t>

    <t>Thank you. I wish you luck too.First of all, I would like to specify intellectual beings as suggested by Piccini. Intellectual beings are beings that have a considerately high EQ and IQ compared to other beings. Also, intellectual beings would be able to solve problems head-on, whether it's as small of a problem as quarrels between individuals or as big of a problem as a global crisis like global warming. 1. Humans claim that they are an 'intellectual being'. However, looking back at the past, the Great War and World War II were caused from greediness and small quarrels between leaders of countries. If humans really are smart, they would have sorted out the problem peacefully and would not have any means of using forces and military armies. 2. Humans had been discovering about the universe and trying to build spaceships to go out and conquer other planets. They call this an 'advanced technology' and 'in-dept knowledge'. In truth, what humans currently know about the universe is so little it couldn't even be compared with a pin in the ocean. 3. Humans had been destroying the nature; polluting rivers and oceans, contaminating the air, and cutting down trees. If humans really are intelligent and wise, they should know beforehand the problems they're creating for themselves; the problems that won't be fixed in time and cause a disastrous effect to the human race, like the saying 'Only after the last tree has been cut down. Only after the last river has been poisoned. Only after the last fish has been caught. Only then will you find that money cannot be eaten.' Furthermore, fish and other animals are being killed at an extremely rapid speed, causing species after species to go extinct. Without any prevention, mankind would be the last living race and would have nothing to eat. 4. Medical cares are improving all around the world. However, it is not good enough. Cloning had been successful in laboratories. Animals had been cloned. What about humans? Why aren't you being cloned so that your internal organs could be replaced in case of some accidents. I am looking forward to seeing your replies.</t>

Population Growth On average, 360 people are born each day with only 150,000 that die each day[1]. This, on its face, seems like a staggering difference. Also, in 1993 the word population was at 5,535,753,998, however the world population today is roughly 7,066,964,964[2]. This means that in just 20 years the world population has increased by 1,531,210,0966 billion people. Here is a graph which illustrates population growth: Essentially, the point I am trying to get across is that the population is growing at an alarming pace. I think it is clear that the facts substantiate this quite well indeed. The Need For Population Control  Stabilisation, or gradual reduction in population is one of the best ways to address the carbon emissions problem. The National Academy of Sciences demonstrated that slowing the population growth rate of a country to 1.5 births per woman from 2 births per woman could result in a 10% drop in greenhouse gas emissions by the middle of the century, and a 33% drop by the end of the century[3]. Also, the lack of land mass on this planet is a huge issue: “Calculations have been made that any given land mass has a certain carrying capacity, based on its ability to support its inhabitants' needs.” – Colin Feltham[4]Another crucial aspect here is population growth's relation to poverty . Below are some simple statistics from 1950 - 85[5] showing a correlation between a rising population and the percentage of rising poverty:                                                                                                         Table 4-1 World Population 1950-85: Key Facts Size and Rates   1950  1960  1970  1980  1985 Total Population(billions)World2.53.03.74.44.8More developed regions0.830.941.051.141.17Less developed regions 1.68 2.072.653.313.66 Annual Growth *(per cent)World 1.82.01.91.7More developed regions 1.31.00.80.6Less developed regions 2.12.52.32.0 Urban Population(per cent)World2934374041More developed regions5467677072Less developed regions1722252931 As more human beings are being born, higher percentages of poverty throughout the population. Now, I agree that correlation does not necessarily equate to causation. When we are dealing with consistent correlation of this type however, then it does seem to suggest causation at the very least in context. The more people their are, the less finite resources there are for everybody; and poverty arises. This hypothesis would generally predict such statistics above, and best explains the data. The most important problem, in my opinion, is the problem of a growing population and finite resources. For example, theEarth Policy Institute showed that grain consumption of the world has far surpassed global production in six of the latest seven years, falling short with regards to the 60 million tonnes that was seen in 2006. Grain production has shown a huge declining trend within the past 20 years[6]. Also, we are losing our oil at an incredible speed:'The rapid increase in the world’s population over the last hundred years is not merely coincident with the rapid increase in oil production.' - Peter Goodchild[7] This section above shows a self-evident need for population control on a serious scale. There is no realistic way for human beings to flourish and thrive very much longer without it, as the planet cannot sustain this many people continuously into the future like we would hope. It seems apparent that logic, statistical evidence, and mere common sense can lead any rational agent to this obvious conclusion. The Homosexual's Role In Population ControlStraight people are the root cause of the population growth problem, and are on a path to leading our society down a path of pollution, poverty, and famine. They have sex, produce children, and those children grow up and do the same in a world that can barely sustain the people that already live in it. Straight sex acts are required for the existence of a society, but not the flourishing of a society once growth gets unreasonable. Our Earth and its contents are finite, so to think we can keep going on like this is fancifulHomosexuals are crucial to this picture, as they are less likely to have children by copulating with a female and producing offspring. The more homosexual and bisexual people there are having sex, the better grip we will have on population control, and less poverty there will be. It will increase the amount of land we will have to sustain us, and increase the resources in place for us to thrive as a society. With more people being born than dying each day at the hands of straight sex, homosexual acts are a clear benefit when taking population control into account. If everybody on Earth was straight, the problems associated with population growth would be much higher than it is today. It seems very probable that homosexuals may be our savior:'We preserve the species. We are conservation realized. We provide nature's ... restraint ... on procreative extravagance. We keep human production from becoming ... overproduction ... pollution ... destruction unbridled. We keep the human race from becoming ... an obscene cosmic joke.' - G. Roger Denson[8]G. Roger Denson states my main point very well, and also had this to say:'With the natural world on the brink of demise largely because of overpopulation, unrestrained homosexuality, as one of a variety of ethical and democratic measures available to us today, offers perhaps the most natural option to be enjoined. What other options are as attractive? We don't want to die young. We don't want to face illness or catastrophe. Many individuals and societies refuse abortion and birth control. Few would condone or submit willingly to the kind of international law imposing a one-child policy like that exercised by China on all nations. And we hardly need to be reminded of the history of racist, eugenicist, and militarist agendas for imposing growth control on unwilling and unknowing populations. So why shouldn't homosexuality be seen as providing a viable option to overpopulation--to the point that the world's nations come to encourage its practice and esteem its benefits? It is, after all, the most harmonious way to control the population--considering all that's required is that we love and support our gay sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, parents, friends, lovers, and selves.' -  G. Roger Denson[8]Conclusion The population is growing to the point where our planet can barely sustain us. This is due to straight sex acts on a massive scale. Homosexual acts cause somewhat of a balance in nature, as homosexuals are way less likely to have the type of intercourse which creates offspring. Homosexuals are a way to sustain our species; so the planet can sustain us. For this reason, it is reasonable to conclude that homosexuals are an asset to the overall thriving of the human species. I look forward to Con's rebuttal.</h>

    <t>Here we are, the final round of debating, and without a further ado;  1. Humans and emotion - Survival of the fittest doesn't fit with our world view today; we humans, right now, living on Earth, need to look out for ourselves, the environment, and countless other small things. Emotions and intellect (as you stated, working together) can often be used in unison, such as the protection of animals. We often stop the brutalisation of animals because of two reasons; 1. We care about animals due to our emotions, and 2. Without a large number of animals, the ecosystem would probably fall into itself, an example of intelligence. Without sympathy, we wouldn't have a planet, without intelligence, we wouldn't be trying to put a stop to the gross destruction of our forests and environments. Emotions and intelligence can often work in unison, and when this happens, it works.  Doesn't this point go against what you stated in your previous one; 'survival of the fittest is not always a bad idea' and 'ignore any sympathy'. Yes, humans over hunt and yes, we do do it for inane, ridiculous reasons, but look around you, people are now fighting back. With the advent of new technology, we have been able to kill more efficiently, but with that efficiency came more and more people fighting against it. Today, the amount of people that support the slaughter of animals and the environment is grossly outnumbered by those who want to save and protect, and our ability to work together collectively, as a species, towards the protection of the enviroment shows our true emotions, and our true intelligence.  2. The cost of resources - This proves nothing to the question at hand, and besides, humans have been making breakthroughs into discovering and/or developing these 'scarce recources', I've already said it. All that is needed now is a matter of time, and it will happen; humans will develop far better materials, humans will develop new and better ways of getting to space, it is all there in my previous arguments. Our ability to move forward, using the information we have is not a burden on the question of intelligence, but lifts the idea that humans are intelligent beings.  3. War and peace - But it proves they're intelligent. You stated in the second round, one area of intelligence could be defined as humans ability to solve problems, and they have done that. Dictators or democratically elected people, despite the amount of corruption, have been able to not ignite a nuclear war. Whether is was for themselves or not (we don't know what was going through their heads) one thing is certain; we are not dead and dying from the radioactive fallout of nuclear war, something that proved the quick thinking of leaders in times of crisis. On your second point, yes, humans care for the enviroment for financially beneficial reasons, but they also care for its protection. Does the UN, which is primarily an international, 'not-for profit' organization protect the enviroment because of its financially stable when its intact. Did so many nations sign the Kyoto protocol just to protect their income, and finally, are so many nations right now (like my home Australia) SPENDING billions of dollars on protecting the enviroment a proof that they care for it 'just for the money'. For all of the points, I do not think so; I believe that nations, and their inhabitants, as the majority, wish to protect the enviroment to actually see it survive, and continue, another proof of our intellect.  4. The bumps in the road - Yes, there are bad things going on in the world, and yes, there have always been bumps in the road, but if you looked around the world, you would see those bumps are filling. Wars are no longer as conventional and destructive as they once were, racism and bigotry is falling all over the world, humans are truly beginning to come together to help protect the enviroment, save animals, as well as people, in need, and further our knowledge and information about the sciences. It may take time, but our 'bad' emotions are no longer getting in the way of progress like they once were, a final proof of our true intellect of togetherness, and progress over many fields.  Conclusion - We have gotten so far in the 200,000 years of our existence. We started off as hunter-gatherers, followed by small settlements, followed by kingdoms, followed by empires, followed by the democratic world we live in today. All over, progress is furthering, our knowledge is furthering, or ability to grasp what it means to be human and our continuing quest for peace is furthering. Yes, the bumps have been the road, and there are plenty more ahead of us, but by the rate we are going, we will be able to protect the enviroment, we will be able to save animals and planet species that are at risk, we will put an end to war, we will see out the end of the century, together as one species, knowledgeable and intelligent.  I would like to thank Pandas for an incredibly interesting debate, and the time he has given up to debate over the past few days, and I too wish him well in the voting period.</t>
<h>    Here we are, the final round of debating, and without a further ado;  1. Humans and emotion - Survival of the fittest doesn't fit with our world view today; we humans, right now, living on Earth, need to look out for ourselves, the environment, and countless other small things.</h>

    <t>Thank you for your reply, and I too wish you luck for the final round;  1. Humans and emotion - Except for moral choices. Humans need emotion sometimes to guide them, as individuals, through tough times in their lives. Just because they had to make a hard decision doesn't mean they aren't intelligent; all it means is that we are emotional creatures, with the capacity of understanding and intellectual conversation. Humanity, and modern life, isn't as simple as a game of 1's and 2's; its far more complicated. Without emotion, we would basically be robots, willing to do work without a forethought of morals or sympathy. We would continue to take down the environment to help ourselves, we would continue to slaughter animals just to further our own comfort. We will feel bad about pulling that leaver, and there will be sorrow, but we can't act like robots, if we aren't to lose our humanity, and our true intelligence for togetherness and sympathy.  2. Technology and resources - What I meant with the 'mass production' and 'selling' aspect of the argument is that you shouldn't sell to the population, but to private companies or investors. These technologies will cost a lot of money up front, and you would need both the support of both companies (who would probably be the ones to invest and partake in astronomical mining) but also the population, who through taxes, would probably be investing in some way or another. I don't want to get too far away from the question asked, so I'll stand behind my argument; these technologies will cost a lot of money, and our failure to progress into far flung future technologies is not due to a lack of our intelligence, but to funds, lack of knowledge at this time, and the fact that technological process, whilst slow, is speeding up thanks to innovations brought about by our intelligence.  3. Global warming - Was it truly fear and greed that didn't bring about nuclear war? Perhaps, but it is probably more likely that they (government leaders) saw the destructive events that happened at both Nagasaki and Hiroshima, and believed that they, and their population, shouldn't be brought to a nuclear end. The want to survive appears in all populations, and that isn't stimulated by greed, but by nature. The leaders knew damn well that they could escape somewhere more safe, perhaps a bunker, but they still didn't bring doomsday to their people. Is it because of greed? No, it is because they probably truly cared for their people, and they wanted to protect not just themselves, but also the citizens. This want to protect human beings, and the environment (to an extent) from certain death proves of the leaders compassion for the masses, and them having the intelligence not to blow up the world.  I think the point I'm trying to make is that protecting the people, as well as protecting yourself, is as much a part of nature as it is human intelligence and sympathy. We need to get back on track with this argument, and not stray to far into new subjects.  4. Human togetherness - Yet it doesn't make them non-intelligent either. Your argument is that humans beings need to have substantial 'intellect' and 'knowledge' to be considered intelligent. Further more, you have stated that human beings, as a species, need to be intelligent as a majority. Where do you draw these lines; the ability to speak, the ability to work together, the ability to do one basic human action. Humans, throughout history have been working together towards goals, and every time their was a bump in the road, we have moved past it. Slavery is all but gone, homophobia is on the decline, women having voting rights now. This is a sign that we, humans, as a species, are beginning to become more open, and more intellectually aware of each other, and our compassion has all but gone up ten fold. Our new fond ability to work together is a sure sign that we are intellectual creatures.  Conclusion - Life isn't simple, it is a hard game to play. Intelligence cannot be defined by a simple action, nay a line drawn in sand. Our actions taken today may be based around emotions, but our true intelligence is found within working together, and that is what we have done. Progress, both in technology and in society have allowed us to go to the deepest trench of the ocean, to the moon itself. Today, we are progressing faster and faster, and our emotions, whilst they sometimes get in the way, don't distract from our true capacity for knowledge and problem solving.  Again, I would like to thank Pandas, and wish him luck in the final round of debating.</t>

    <t>I would like to thanks my opponent for his thoughtful arguments. It is finally round 4. I wish him luck in the final round.For now, my rebuttals:1. Humans never have to control their emotions all the time. It is because they are yet to be considered intelligent. It is a normal thing for you to gang up on your enemies. It is a basic common sense. If you go alone and die, then it is you being stupid. Right or wrong, without emotions, humans will be able to make the best choices. Suppose a train is coming and your friend is standing on the track. You are standing right next to the switch and could switch the track for the train. However, there are two strangers on the other track. What would be best here? Normally, people would choose to save their friend and let the two strangers die due to their emotions. Without emotions, people won't switch the track and only one life would be lost instead of two. With emotions, two lives lost for one. 2. Advanced technologies don't always need to be produced on a mass scale to be sold to normal people. Sometimse ignorance is needed for better advancement. It is like a chess game; a strategy called gambit. Looking at our world right now, it could be predicted that resources on Earth would be completely depleted in the near future. Instead of producing advanced technologies on a mass scale and selling it to the population, scientists might as well ignore the population for the time being and continue advancing the future technologies so that they would be able to get resources from other planets at a lower and beneficial cost. After that, they could start producing high-tech materials for the population.3. The fact that the nuclear wars are being prevented with our knowledge and intellect is half right. However, it is mostly being prevented by the fear and greed of humans; fear of dying and greediness, wanting to have things for themselves and their country. Without fear and greed, many problems would have resulted in a nuclear war by now. Only the minority of the population trying to stop global warming is like trying to move mountains with a tea spoon. It is moving forward but isn't going to reach its conclusion.Governments binding to prevent the greenhouse effect from going from worse to worst is like making war; what you see isn't what it is. Wars are created for the money and resources of the opposing countries. Likewise, the governments who control countries, being controlled by greed, just want money. Making new products and satisfying the population would allow them to continue the position as the government, allowing them to corrupt even longer and get wealthier and wealthier. 4. In order for humans to be considered intelligent, the majority of the population would have to have an appropriate amount of knowledge and intellect. Yes, there are some less stupid people who exists or existed. However, that does not makes the human race an intelligent species. I agree it is not a bad decision for people to join up and work together though. That would be more effective as an individual and as a whole. Conclusion- The only thing between the ears is air. It is true that people are working together to advance humans overall well-being and to move forward. Nevertheless, the majority of humans are still being manipulated by greed and emotions, causing them to make irrational decisions. This, proves the fact that humans are less stupid from before but is yet to be an intellectual being.</t>
<h>    I would like to thanks my opponent for his thoughtful arguments.</h>

    <t>1. Humans and emotion - As you have stated, life is not a simple game. However, that is only as it is right now; living life with emotions. If humans could control their emotions, life would be even more simple than drinking water or breathing itself. Make decisions that are best for themselves. Help others by taking care of yourself. Don't be a burden to others. Ignore any sympathy. Remember the rule 'survival of the fittest'. The weaks will die and that is not a bad thing. Instead of suffering through their life and end up dying miserably, they could be reborn or go to heaven or the afterlife. Nowadays humans are already taking down the environment to help themselves, let alone slaughtering animals just to further their comfort. Tigers, bears, whales, and many other animals that are not meant to be hunted to be eaten, are hunted down for decorations or unreasonable reasons. There is no sorrow or sympathy in these slaughterings. There is nothing; only the thought of living on. (and greed)2. Monies are things people use to pay for things and define how much things are worth. Rare materials are worth more so it cost more. Rare things that are hard to find cause 'scarcity'. If only humans get rid of the scarcity of materials needed for space exploration, whether through experimentation or obtaining from nature, the cost would be significantly lowered. 3. I still stand my point that corruption and greed are what prevented nuclear wars. Government wanting to protect their country and continue the post as the government is so that they could continue with corruption. When the country is in a poor state (after wars), there would be less things for them or it would be harder for them to corrupt. No one wants to protect human beings. Wars are going on all around the world right now and barely anyone cares. They also care for the environment to a minimal extent; they will always care for the environment as long as the environment is financially beneficial to them somehow. This, is what truly prevents nuclear wars. 4. There are bumps everywhere right now, whether it's prostitution, human trafficking, or illegal drugs. Countries are fighting with each other. There will always be a place with no sign of peace of togetherness. Let alone togetherness in the world when kids and civilians still fight with each other. There are many racists in this world; Black, Asians, or third-world countries.  Conclusion - Life will be very simple if humans could control their emotions. Without emotions, humans would be able to make flawless decisions purely based on their intellect. How well they make their decisions will be fully dependant on their intellect, not being intervened by emotions. Also, advancements don't always represent intellect. Stupid people could advance too.  Lastly, I would like to thanks the Pro for giving me an enjoyable debate with interesting arguments. I wish him luck for the voting period. Thanks.</t>

    <t>IntroductionI thank my opponent for his response, however he ignored the bulk of my arguments; thus they still stand unscathed. Also, I clicked 'submit' by accident and posted my last round without double-checking for errors. I meant to say '360,000 people die each day', not '360 people die each day' for instance. I do apologize for any confusion pertaining to my last round. Population Growth My opponent here says that birth rates have been on a decline within the past 12 years. This is a red herring[1] logical fallacy, as it has no bearing on the resolution we are discussing. Even if birth rates have been on the decline, that would not mean that homosexuality does not help to aid the population growth problem. For example, if I have money problems, but my money is actually starting to increase, does that mean that an extra $1000.00 is not an asset, or does not help? Of course not. Even if the problem is starting to be solved, that extra money is still an asset. Similarly, even if birth rates are decreasing; homosexuality is still an asset because it aids in the decrease of the overall population. This section from Con does absolutely nothing to undermine my argument. I am not arguing that homosexuals are essential to the overall thriving of the human species, just that they are an asset. An extra good player on my Chess team is an asset, but we can do well without him, so he is not essential. Regardless, lets take a look at my opponent's first chart here: You will notice that way more people are being born than are dying. Thus, even if birth rates are decreasing, the population itself is still growing at a staggering rate. Therefore, this section from Con is rather trivial. 'Despite lower expected fertility rates, [the world population] is likely to reach 9.1 billion by 2050, with most of the increase taking place in developing countries...'[2]The point the above quote is trying to get across, is even with a decrease in birth rates, population growth is still out of control. We Definitely Do Need Population Control My opponent completely ignored all my arguments in favor of the need for population control. Con never addressed the statistical evidence that population growth causes the percentage of poverty around the globe to rise. He never addressed my evidence that food and oil companies cannot keep up with the global population growth, and that our finite resources are being lost at a staggering rate. Con never addressed my evidence that population control is the best way to lower Co2 emissions, and did not object to my claims about finite habitable land. Con just pretended like my arguments did not even exist, and presented a lackluster case against the notion that we need population control. He quotes one person who seems to disagrees with me, but he did not post any statistical evidence to back up his claims. Lets delve into the arguments for the need for population control a little further shall we?Fossil FuelsOil is a finite resource that our entire economy depends on[3]. Con probably just wants people to forget about this, however this problem will not go away unless action is taken. We are losing way too much of our oil at the hands of the growing population: People are being killed in the middle east over oil. I do not believe people should die over oil. The human species cannot thrive with wars over finite resources. This scarcity problem is largely due the population growth problem. This seems to suggest that it is fanciful to view population control as anything less than needed. People are going to extreme measures to obtain this precious substance, when we do not have to fight over oil. All we need to do is keep the population down. Also, Petroleum is declining at an average yearly rate of between 2% and 6%, maybe nearer to 4%[4]Food and WaterFamine and shortage of water is going to be a huge problem in our future, as there are too many people to feed the world already. It is also commonly known that overpopulation is the cause of famine in many counties[5], and that population growth and famine are inherently linked[6]. These are irrefutable facts. Here is an illustrative chart regarding population and carrying capacity:Also, take Ethiopia. It is quite known that they have a famine problem, and it is also known that population growth is the culprit[7]. I am sincerely baffled as to how Con cannot argue with a straight face that we do not need population control. Additionally, there is a clear correlation here with regards to population growth and water shortages:PollutionAreas with the most people have the most pollution[8]. Pollution harms human beings, and hinders the flourishing and thriving of our species[9]. This further demonstrates the need for population control on a massive scale.ConclusionCon mentioned a birth rate decrease, but not a population decrease; thus his argument with regards to my 'Population Growth' section is a red herring. My opponent does not contest the fact that the population is growing at an alarming rate. Against the need for population control Con provided no case, and no statistical evidence. He simply quoted a man who disagrees with me. I provided overwhelming evidence in favor of the need for population control. My opponent also did not contest the fact the if population control is needed, that homosexuals would be an asset. Due to the fact that I sufficiently supported my case, and Con had a rather weak rebuttal; it is safe to say that the resolution has been affirmed.I look forward to my opponent's rebuttal.</t>

    <t>Introduction I would also like to thank my opponent for posting both an interesting and tough topic. I will be arguing that population growth is not the problem and that homosexuals do not help in the overall thriving of the Human species.Population GrowthI would like to focus the population Growth for the past 12 years. In the year 2000 the population of the world was 6,082,966,429 and now in 2013 the population of the world is at 7,124,339,094 and growing and by the year 2050 the population will be estimated to be at 9,346,399,468. When you look at the graph below you will see how the climb of the population is: My opponent alludes to that we need to lower the birth rate so that population can begun to stabilize, but by the next chart the birth rate has actually gone down in the last 12 years.  Birth rate (births/1,000 population) It doesn't make any sense does it the Birth rate is going down, but the population is increasing. The reason for this is the advancements in medical practice has kept children alive longer. Now days if a preemie child that is given treatment early nearly has a 70% chance for survival while back even 12 years ago the child had a very little chance to live. With the medical treatment diseases don't kill like they used to and people can get medicine fast. Such discoveries like an Once-a-day HIV Pill,Targeted Drug Therapies for Cancer, Hormone Replacement Therapy,Advances in Treating Coronary Heart Disease, having vaccines for diseases and eliminating diseases from existence, etc.  When you look at the death rate as seen here. Death rate (deaths/1,000 population) We Don't Need Population Control The fear should not be about overpopulation it should be for depopulation. Very low fertility is when a birth rate is below 1.5 children per woman. Europe experienced this between 1995-2000 when there birth rate was 1.42. The consequences of these very low levels of procreation are told by U.N. demographer Joseph Charnie when he addressed the Population Association of America on April 2, 2004-'Growing number of countries view their low birth rates with the resulting population decline and ageing to be a serious crisis jeopardizing the basic foundations of the nation and threatening its survival Economic growth and vitality, defense, and pensions and health care for the elderly for example, are all areas of major concern.' Europe has had problems with their birth rate and it has hurt their economy and nations strength. Society that have a low growth rate tend to fall and if the idea that homosexuals will lower birth rate will actually hurt human thriving.Conclusion Even with lower birth rates population still is increasing. Homosexuality has nothing to do with the thriving and if anything it hurts the thriving by not having children countries can face economic and overall society struggle. I look forward to my opponents rebuttal. </t>

    <t>IntroductionI would thank my opponent as well. We Don't Need population Control 1. Like I stated before when a population is decreasing the country faces many problems. Like lower employment and a bad economy.2. Co2 has been proven not to get the world hotter, but instead it cools the Earth because it bounces the Co2 back into the atmosphere. The largest green house gas is water vapor, no one can stop water vapor unless you want to stop volcanoes and the evaporation cycle. Also the world goes through a cycle of warming and cooling has evident here-3. If the fear is lack of energy by oil than the world must adampt. Around the world people are becoming less dependement on fossil fuel and turning to green energy. Like solar, wind, water, and nuclear power that countries already have adopted and other countres will when the fossil fuel go down.4.The problem is not food stortages it is the way we spread it out. We grow enough food to feed 10 billion people, but the problem is not supply it is how the food is getting around. So homosexuals have nothing to do with this.5. Homosexuals have nothing to do with birth rate. The birth's have not changed the thing that has changed is the children being born out of wedlock. That has increased by 17% since 1970. What homosexuals acutally do is that they adopt these children and actually help the populaiton growth. Because a child that is fatherless is more likly to commit sucide also they are more likely to get married and have children. If homosexuals raise childen than the fatherless is taken out causing less death from inflicted injury. 6. If we want population control than homosexuality won't help in this. Countries fear depopulation than overpopulaiton, becasue we have the resources for 10 billion people, but we can't survive with less.</t>

    <t>The first round is for acceptance.</t>
<h>I thank Sabutai for letting me part of this debate. I have only just seen the part of the Round 2 requirements which includes the terminology 'no rebuttals by Pro', which I do consider somewhat odd being that Con has provided material which I believe probably does deserve an immediate response in order to give Con time to revise or clarify certain parts of his argument. Still, I do have enough in my arsenal for me to present a better case than what Con presents for my case that humans are indeed the main cause of global warming. Let us begin:  Agriculture  Something that people are not so aware of with regards to global warming is the contribution of agriculture - which is to say livestock and farming - which is third in the world for CO2 emissions. CO2 isn't even the leading GHG emission from farming, as methane is the major contributing by-product. It is huge (1). To quote:  'In 2010, global greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector totaled 4.7 billion tons of carbon dioxide (COv(2)) equivalent, up 13 percent over 1990. Agriculture is the third largest contributor to global emissions by sector, following the burning of fossil fuels for power and heat, and transportation. In 2010, emissions from electricity and heat production reached 12.5 billion tons, and emissions from transport totaled 6.7 billion tons.  Despite their continuing rise, emissions from agriculture are growing at a much slower rate than the sector as a whole, demonstrating the increasing carbon efficiency of agriculture. From 1990 to 2010, the volume of agricultural production overall increased nearly 23 percent, according to data compiled by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) for its program, FAOSTAT. FAO released a new Greenhouse Gas Emissions database for agriculture, forestry and other land use changes in December 2012, which can be found here (http://www.fao.org...).  According to FAO, methane accounts for just under half of total agricultural emissions, nitrous oxide for 36 percent, and carbon dioxide for some 14 percent. The largest source of methane emissions is enteric fermentation, or the digestion of organic materials by livestock, predominantly beef cattle. This is also the largest source of agricultural emissions overall, contributing 37 percent of the total.'  There is, quite simply, no way that this much methane and nitrous oxide are from natural causes, and the fact that 50%of the earth's surface is given over to farm and grazing land means a huge loss of forest, which serves as a carbon sink(the main sink is the oceans, however), so combined deforestation plus emissions from agriculture are man made.  The amount of Arctic Ice Loss  This is now greater than it has been in 3 million years, and this absolutely cannot be said to be from natural causes. To quote (2):  'The thaw and release of carbon currently frozen in permafrost will increase atmospheric CO2 concentrations and amplify surface warming to initiate a positive permafrost carbon feedback (PCF) on climate'. [Our] estimate may be low because it does not account for amplified surface warming due to the PCF itself'. We predict that the PCF will change the arctic from a carbon sink to a source after the mid-2020s and is strong enough to cancel 42-88% of the total global land sink. The thaw and decay of permafrost carbon is irreversible and accounting for the PCF will require larger reductions in fossil fuel emissions to reach a target atmospheric CO2 concentration.  The permafrost permamelt contains a staggering '1.5 trillion tons of frozen carbon, about twice as much carbon as contained in the atmosphere, much of which would be released as methane. Methane is 25 times as potent a heat-trapping gas as CO2 over a 100 year time horizon, but 72 times as potent over 20 years! One of the most conservative assumptions the study made, the lead author Dr. Kevin Schaefer confirmed in an email, is that all of the carbon would be released as CO2 and none as methane.'  And to quote from another study about the Arctic (3):  ' 'The bad news is that there is a clear connection between temperature and the amount of sea ice. And there is no doubt that continued global warming will lead to a reduction in the amount of summer sea ice in the Arctic Ocean. The good news is that even with a reduction to less than 50% of the current amount of sea ice the ice will not reach a point of no return: a level where the ice no longer can regenerate itself even if the climate was to return to cooler temperatures,' [lead author Svend] Funder says. '  So chalk up another point for how influential mankind is in contributing to global warming.  Deforestation  This one is plainly simple (4), because according to CO2 NOW, we find the situation where forest loss contributes 9% to CO2 build up, and forests account for 26% of CO2 absorption, so deforestation has been a huge man made contributor as well.  The reliability and enduring nature of the hockey stick graph  According to the New Scientist article covering the 2006 report of the US National Academy of Science (5):  'The report states: 'The basic conclusion of Mann et al. (1998, 1999) was that the late 20th century warmth in the Northern Hemisphere was unprecedented during at least the last 1000 years. This conclusion has subsequently been supported by an array of evidence that includes both additional large-scale surface temperature reconstructions and pronounced changes in a variety of local proxy indicators, such as melting on ice caps and the retreat of glaciers around the world'.  Most researchers would agree that while the original hockey stick can - and has - been improved in a number of ways, it was not far off the mark. Most later temperature reconstructions fall within the error bars of the original hockey stick. Some show far more variability leading up to the 20th century than the hockey stick, but none suggest that it has been warmer at any time in the past 1000 years than in the last part of the 20th century. ... Climate scientists, however, are only too aware of the problems (see Climate myths: It was warmer during the Medieval period), and the uncertainties were both highlighted by Mann's original paper and by others at the time it was published. ... The new reconstruction has been generated using two statistical methods, both different to that used in the original study. Like other temperature reconstructions done since 2001 (see graph), it shows greater variability than the original hockey stick. Yet again, though, the key conclusion is the same: it's hotter now than it has been for at least 1000 years.  In fact, independent evidence, from ice cores and sea sediments for instance, suggest the last time the planet approached this degree of warmth was during the interglacial period preceding the last ice age over 100,000 years ago. It might even be hotter now than it has been for at least a million years.  Further back in the past, though, it certainly has been hotter - and the world has been a very different place. The crucial point is that our modern civilisation has been built on the basis of the prevailing climate and sea levels. As these change, it will cause major problems.'  It is quite clear that all this evidence is very strong for the weight of man's influence in helping global warming along. I now hand back to Con.  </h>

<h>I would like to thank JonMilne for accepting this debate.I. The Universe and Global WarmingThe current state of the Galaxy and our Sun is affecting our temperatures.I.i. The Rest of the Solar SystemThe Sun clearly is in a warmer phase, because all of the other planets have increasing temperatures as well. 'In 2005 data from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor and Odyssey missions revealed that the carbon dioxide 'ice caps' near Mars's south pole had been diminishing for three summers in a row.Habibullo Abdussamatov, head of space research at St. Petersburg's Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory in Russia, says the Mars data is evidence that the current global warming on Earth is being caused by changes in the sun.'[1]''Global warming on Neptune's moon Triton as well as Jupiter and Pluto, and now Mars has some [scientists] scratching their heads over what could possibly be in common with the warming of all these planets … Could there be something in common with all the planets in our solar system that might cause them all to warm at the same time?''[2] Two things can be drawn from this. One, that if other planets are warming, that it is only natural for the Earth to be warming as well. And second, that even if all these planets did have natural causes, then that is a sign of Earth's natural climatic change, instead of man-made. I.ii. The Position of the Milky Way GalaxyEvery approximately 135 million years, Earth enters a more populated area of the Milky Way, and as a result, more cosmic rays hit the Earth, which causes cooling. Currently, we are in a less populated area of the Milky Way, which means that less of these cosmic rays will be hitting the Earth, which means less cloud formation, and of course, warming. [3] for the source on this hypothesis. The sun can also cause this through evaporation.II. Earthly CausesThere are many internal causes of Global Warming as well. II.i. Ocean Current Anomalies Ocean temperature anomalies seem to be rising-along with the temperature. '...one can model past temperatures as a linear trend (that started well before CO2 was added in any substantial quantity) and periodic bumps... ...temperatures over the last 100+ years look a lot like a linear trend plus ocean cycle-driven bumps'[4] What is causing all the bumps?:[4]As shown in the graph, the PDO, or ocean currents, temperature has affected the average Earth's temperature. II.ii. Clouds: A Continuation of Point I.ii.I mentioned about the position of the Milky Way Galaxy and the Sun in regards to these 'cosmic rays'. Here is a more in depth look at the effects of position. 'The implications, if true, had potentially enormous implications for the debate about natural causes of warming. When the sun is very active, it can be thought of as pushing away cosmic rays from the Earth, reducing their incidence. When the sun is less active, we see more cosmic rays. This is fairly well understood. But if Svensmark was correct, it would mean that periods of high solar output should coincide with reduced cloud formation (due to reduced cosmic race incidence), which in turn would have a warming effect on the Earth, since less sunlight would be reflected back into space before hitting the Earth.Here was a theory, then, that would increase the theoretical impact on climate of an active sun, and better explain why solar irradiance changes might be underestimating the effect of solar output changes on climate and temperatures.'[4]'Since he first suggested his hypothesis over a decade and a half ago, Svensmark and other researchers have slowly been putting together research to test it.' The results were: 'Scientists found that when shielding was removed and natural cosmic rays allowed to hit the chamber, cloud seeding increased dramatically, and it increased substantially again when additional artificial cosmic rays were added. Svensmark appears to have gotten it right.'[5] Proof here is in the next points. III. The 1500-Year Cycle This has to do with a cycle of the climate that can explain the warming. 'Through at least the last million years, a moderate 1500-year warm-cold cycle has been superimposed over the longer, stronger Ice Ages and warm interglacials.'[6]Here is a graph related to this: [7]There are two things we can conclude from this graph. First, that up-and-down cycles are normal for the long-term climate. This century's global warming is nothing new. The second thing we can conclude, is that today's global warming is not as bad as the Medieval Warm Period's peak yet, and the Medieval Warm Period was less than the Holocene Maximum Period. 'Even more important, the earth is not 'the warmest it has ever been.' In fact, the earth was much warmer during the Medieval Warm Period when human agriculture flourished!'[7]'The scientists found evidence that on average, every 1,470 years, plus or minus 500 years, cold, ice-bearing waters, which today circulate around southern Greenland, pushed as far south as Great Britain.'[8] There seems to be a full cycle of up-down-up temperatures of the climate every 1470 years. And this goes as far back as at least 1 million years ago. Currently, we are in an upswing of temperatures, just coming off of the Little Ice Age, the peak to be in a few hundred years, making the peak-to-peak difference between today's global warming and the Medieval Warm Period a little less than 1500 years. So today's Global Warming is a natural, cyclical occurence. IV. The Sun: The Proof of Theories I.ii and II.iiThe sun's cycles have a lot to do with temperatures also. 'In this chamber, 63 CERN scientists from 17 European and American institutes have done what global warming doomsayers said could never be done — demonstrate that cosmic rays promote the formation of molecules that in Earth’s atmosphere can grow and seed clouds, the cloudier and thus cooler it will be. Because the sun’s magnetic field controls how many cosmic rays reach Earth’s atmosphere (the stronger the sun’s magnetic field, the more it shields Earth from incoming cosmic rays from space), the sun determines the temperature on Earth.'[9]'Svensmark matched the data on cosmic rays from the neutron monitor in Climax, Colorado, with the satellite measurements of solar irradiance from 1970 to 1990. Over the period between 1975 and 1989, he found cosmic rays decreased by 1.2 percent annually, amplifying the sun's change in irradiance about four-fold'[6]So, as the sun's activity increases, so does the temperature. This below graph shows the correlation: [10]This graph clearly shows that temperature goes up and down with solar activity, because an increase in solar activity directly correlates with an increase in average temperature 1-2 years later. And as a final side note, I would like to present this graph that helps disprove the anthropogenic cause theory, regarding again, ocean temperature anomalies:[4]So 'nature' created the same temperature trend as 'humans' did.

Thus, it can be disregarded. I provided statistical evidence and facts proving the need for population control. He completely ignored the notion that the more people there are, the higher percentage of poverty arises. I will show this chart[1] again:                                                                                                         Table 4-1 World Population 1950-85: Key Facts Size and Rates   1950  1960  1970  1980  1985 Total Population(billions)World2.53.03.74.44.8More developed regions0.830.941.051.141.17Less developed regions 1.68 2.072.653.313.66 Annual Growth *(per cent)World 1.82.01.91.7More developed regions 1.31.00.80.6Less developed regions 2.12.52.32.0 Urban Population(per cent)World2934374041More developed regions5467677072Less developed regions1722252931 Co2 emissions'2. Co2 has been proven not to get the world hotter... ' - ProThe above is false, and virtually every climate change scientists agrees with me.  'It is the major greenhouse gas produced by humans, which is having the single greatest effect on climate change.'[2] I think my opponent just simply needs to get his facts straight. The scientific consensus is that global warming is due to Co2[3]. Carbon dioxide is released through natural processes such as respiration and volcano eruptions and through human actions like deforestation, land use changes, and burning fossil fuels. We have increased Co2 concentration by 1/3 since the Industrial Revolution started. This is the most crucial long-lived 'forcing' of climate change[3]. Here is another chart showing how temperature rises in correlation with Co2 rising:'The bottom line is that atmospheric carbon dioxide acts as a thermostat in regulating the temperature of Earth.' - Andrew Lacis[4]Andrew Lacis did not just commit a bare assertion, but science proves his statement. My opponent talks about a 'bouncing' effect but without non-condensing greenhouse gases, clouds and the vapor of water would not be ale to provide the feedback mechanisms that amplify the greenhouse effect[4].It seems as if my opponent is simply mistaken. It has been proven beyond a reasonable shadow of a doubt that human beings and Co2 are the reason for the temperature rising. This is the general consensus in climate change science, and it is bascked up by an overwhelming amount of scientific evidence.Fossil FuelsMy opponent says that because of free energy, oil will not be that important. However, this just seems like fantasy in the short term. The US and other major nations still rely on oil, and will for many decades to come. Therefore, as long as this is the case, we need the population down so we can all thrive. Saying that we can solve the oil problem just by getting free-energy universally is a cop out, as its easier said than done. Our economy is too dependant on oil at this point to take my opponent's objection here seriously (at least in the short term). Regardless, I mentioned other finite resources and fossil fuels that my opponent just ignored.Food and WaterMy opponent completely ignored my evidence that the food and water supply cannot catch up to population growth. This alone shows a need for population control. Since homosexuals help the problem by not reproducing nearly as as often as straight people, they are an asset (even if only a small asset).HomosexualsMy opponent says that homosexuals have nothing to do with the birth rate. This is obviously false, as homosexuals cannot produce children together naturally. Also, adopting children does not aid in population growth, as they are adopting children instead of having children. This means, homosexuality aids in population control, not population growth. If they were straight, they would have just reproduced instead of adopting a child that already exists. 'Homosexual men marry much less frequently and have far fewer children than their unambiguously heterosexual counterparts.' -  E. O. Wilson[5]ConclusionI have shown that population control is needed. Even if it is not needed (which it is), at the very least I showed that it would help many of our problems with regards to the flourishing and thriving of human beings. If it can help, then homosexuals can help because they have fewer children than straight people and stabilise the birth rate more. This means that even if they are only a little asset, they are still an asset. My opponent's objections seem to consist of mostly misinformation, and ignoring much of my argument. Therefore, the resolution seems to have been affirmed. </t>

    <t>1. I did state that decreasing population gives countries problems like lower and employment and a bad economy. I backed it up by a statement by U.N. demographer Joseph Charnie that the statement is in my first round sources. This man does population statics and the cause and effect.  2. 98% of all greenhouse gases is water vapor. The hotter the temperature more water vapor is formed causing the Earth to get hotter. That is the main reason for Global Warming when the temperatures rise the water vapor increases. Co2 has a double affect it bounces radiation away from the Earth, but also keeps some of it. But water vapor is what makes it hotter like humidity in an area even if the temperature isn't very high if the humidity is the area feels hot.  3. The United States has more oil than Saudi Arabia. Even though a lot of it is not obtainable yet it will be when we improve our technology. The United States has already made strides in improving green energy. While the United States is not ready to go completely off of fossil fuels it still has over 100 years of oil from Saudi Arabia and even more years from our own resources. These resources can be sold around the world helping in a global fashion.  4. I have a source that shows that the world produces enough food to feed 10 billion people. That means even by 250 when the population is supposed to be 9 billion we could feed the world.  5. While Homosexuals can't have children there are still straight people. In the 2000 U.S. Census Bureau found that homosexual couples constitute less than 1% of American households. That still leaves 99% of household able and are having children. Even though the birth rate has gone down the amount hasn't. With more people able to have children thanks to sperm donators even when a person is unable to have children naturally thanks to medical advancements they can have children.  Homosexuals don't change anything. My opponent shows all of the supposed dangers of an overpopulated world, but doesn't show how much homosexuals would change the number. Because it won't people will still have children and the population will increase whether people are homosexual or not.  sources </t>

And to quote from another study about the Arctic (3):  ' 'The bad news is that there is a clear connection between temperature and the amount of sea ice. And there is no doubt that continued global warming will lead to a reduction in the amount of summer sea ice in the Arctic Ocean. The good news is that even with a reduction to less than 50% of the current amount of sea ice the ice will not reach a point of no return: a level where the ice no longer can regenerate itself even if the climate was to return to cooler temperatures,' [lead author Svend] Funder says. '  So chalk up another point for how influential mankind is in contributing to global warming.  Deforestation  This one is plainly simple (4), because according to CO2 NOW, we find the situation where forest loss contributes 9% to CO2 build up, and forests account for 26% of CO2 absorption, so deforestation has been a huge man made contributor as well.  The reliability and enduring nature of the hockey stick graph  According to the New Scientist article covering the 2006 report of the US National Academy of Science (5):  'The report states: 'The basic conclusion of Mann et al. (1998, 1999) was that the late 20th century warmth in the Northern Hemisphere was unprecedented during at least the last 1000 years. This conclusion has subsequently been supported by an array of evidence that includes both additional large-scale surface temperature reconstructions and pronounced changes in a variety of local proxy indicators, such as melting on ice caps and the retreat of glaciers around the world'.  Most researchers would agree that while the original hockey stick can - and has - been improved in a number of ways, it was not far off the mark. Most later temperature reconstructions fall within the error bars of the original hockey stick. Some show far more variability leading up to the 20th century than the hockey stick, but none suggest that it has been warmer at any time in the past 1000 years than in the last part of the 20th century. ... Climate scientists, however, are only too aware of the problems (see Climate myths: It was warmer during the Medieval period), and the uncertainties were both highlighted by Mann's original paper and by others at the time it was published. ... The new reconstruction has been generated using two statistical methods, both different to that used in the original study. Like other temperature reconstructions done since 2001 (see graph), it shows greater variability than the original hockey stick. Yet again, though, the key conclusion is the same: it's hotter now than it has been for at least 1000 years.  In fact, independent evidence, from ice cores and sea sediments for instance, suggest the last time the planet approached this degree of warmth was during the interglacial period preceding the last ice age over 100,000 years ago. It might even be hotter now than it has been for at least a million years.  Further back in the past, though, it certainly has been hotter - and the world has been a very different place. The crucial point is that our modern civilisation has been built on the basis of the prevailing climate and sea levels. As these change, it will cause major problems.'  It is quite clear that all this evidence is very strong for the weight of man's influence in helping global warming along. I now hand back to Con.  </t>

    <t>I would like to thank JonMilne for accepting this debate.I. The Universe and Global WarmingThe current state of the Galaxy and our Sun is affecting our temperatures.I.i. The Rest of the Solar SystemThe Sun clearly is in a warmer phase, because all of the other planets have increasing temperatures as well. 'In 2005 data from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor and Odyssey missions revealed that the carbon dioxide 'ice caps' near Mars's south pole had been diminishing for three summers in a row.Habibullo Abdussamatov, head of space research at St. Petersburg's Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory in Russia, says the Mars data is evidence that the current global warming on Earth is being caused by changes in the sun.'[1]''Global warming on Neptune's moon Triton as well as Jupiter and Pluto, and now Mars has some [scientists] scratching their heads over what could possibly be in common with the warming of all these planets … Could there be something in common with all the planets in our solar system that might cause them all to warm at the same time?''[2] Two things can be drawn from this. One, that if other planets are warming, that it is only natural for the Earth to be warming as well. And second, that even if all these planets did have natural causes, then that is a sign of Earth's natural climatic change, instead of man-made. I.ii. The Position of the Milky Way GalaxyEvery approximately 135 million years, Earth enters a more populated area of the Milky Way, and as a result, more cosmic rays hit the Earth, which causes cooling. Currently, we are in a less populated area of the Milky Way, which means that less of these cosmic rays will be hitting the Earth, which means less cloud formation, and of course, warming. [3] for the source on this hypothesis. The sun can also cause this through evaporation.II. Earthly CausesThere are many internal causes of Global Warming as well. II.i. Ocean Current Anomalies Ocean temperature anomalies seem to be rising-along with the temperature. '...one can model past temperatures as a linear trend (that started well before CO2 was added in any substantial quantity) and periodic bumps... ...temperatures over the last 100+ years look a lot like a linear trend plus ocean cycle-driven bumps'[4] What is causing all the bumps?:[4]As shown in the graph, the PDO, or ocean currents, temperature has affected the average Earth's temperature. II.ii. Clouds: A Continuation of Point I.ii.I mentioned about the position of the Milky Way Galaxy and the Sun in regards to these 'cosmic rays'. Here is a more in depth look at the effects of position. 'The implications, if true, had potentially enormous implications for the debate about natural causes of warming. When the sun is very active, it can be thought of as pushing away cosmic rays from the Earth, reducing their incidence. When the sun is less active, we see more cosmic rays. This is fairly well understood. But if Svensmark was correct, it would mean that periods of high solar output should coincide with reduced cloud formation (due to reduced cosmic race incidence), which in turn would have a warming effect on the Earth, since less sunlight would be reflected back into space before hitting the Earth.Here was a theory, then, that would increase the theoretical impact on climate of an active sun, and better explain why solar irradiance changes might be underestimating the effect of solar output changes on climate and temperatures.'[4]'Since he first suggested his hypothesis over a decade and a half ago, Svensmark and other researchers have slowly been putting together research to test it.' The results were: 'Scientists found that when shielding was removed and natural cosmic rays allowed to hit the chamber, cloud seeding increased dramatically, and it increased substantially again when additional artificial cosmic rays were added. Svensmark appears to have gotten it right.'[5] Proof here is in the next points. III. The 1500-Year Cycle This has to do with a cycle of the climate that can explain the warming. 'Through at least the last million years, a moderate 1500-year warm-cold cycle has been superimposed over the longer, stronger Ice Ages and warm interglacials.'[6]Here is a graph related to this: [7]There are two things we can conclude from this graph. First, that up-and-down cycles are normal for the long-term climate. This century's global warming is nothing new. The second thing we can conclude, is that today's global warming is not as bad as the Medieval Warm Period's peak yet, and the Medieval Warm Period was less than the Holocene Maximum Period. 'Even more important, the earth is not 'the warmest it has ever been.' In fact, the earth was much warmer during the Medieval Warm Period when human agriculture flourished!'[7]'The scientists found evidence that on average, every 1,470 years, plus or minus 500 years, cold, ice-bearing waters, which today circulate around southern Greenland, pushed as far south as Great Britain.'[8] There seems to be a full cycle of up-down-up temperatures of the climate every 1470 years. And this goes as far back as at least 1 million years ago. Currently, we are in an upswing of temperatures, just coming off of the Little Ice Age, the peak to be in a few hundred years, making the peak-to-peak difference between today's global warming and the Medieval Warm Period a little less than 1500 years. So today's Global Warming is a natural, cyclical occurence. IV. The Sun: The Proof of Theories I.ii and II.iiThe sun's cycles have a lot to do with temperatures also. 'In this chamber, 63 CERN scientists from 17 European and American institutes have done what global warming doomsayers said could never be done — demonstrate that cosmic rays promote the formation of molecules that in Earth’s atmosphere can grow and seed clouds, the cloudier and thus cooler it will be. Because the sun’s magnetic field controls how many cosmic rays reach Earth’s atmosphere (the stronger the sun’s magnetic field, the more it shields Earth from incoming cosmic rays from space), the sun determines the temperature on Earth.'[9]'Svensmark matched the data on cosmic rays from the neutron monitor in Climax, Colorado, with the satellite measurements of solar irradiance from 1970 to 1990. Over the period between 1975 and 1989, he found cosmic rays decreased by 1.2 percent annually, amplifying the sun's change in irradiance about four-fold'[6]So, as the sun's activity increases, so does the temperature. This below graph shows the correlation: [10]This graph clearly shows that temperature goes up and down with solar activity, because an increase in solar activity directly correlates with an increase in average temperature 1-2 years later. And as a final side note, I would like to present this graph that helps disprove the anthropogenic cause theory, regarding again, ocean temperature anomalies:[4]So 'nature' created the same temperature trend as 'humans' did.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank JonMilne for presenting his arguments. I. Greenhouse GasesBefore I begin, here is a chart showing which greenhouse gases absorb which wavelengths of light: [1]I.A. MethaneFrom the chart, it can be seen that methane has an absorption band (at 8 micrometres) that largely overlaps with water vapor, so an increase in methane has little effect on temperature.[1]Also, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill put out a lot of methane, but: 'methane respiration rates increased to levels higher than have ever been recorded, ultimately consuming it and prohibiting its release to the atmosphere.What the Deepwater Horizon incident has taught us is that releases of methane with similar characteristics will not have the capacity to influence climate.'[2][3]I.B. Nitrous OxideIn addition to methane, the wavelengths of light that nitrous oxide absorb largely overlap with that of water vapor, so an increase in nitrous oxide also has little effect on temperature.[1]Also, a new  by Lucky Savings' href='#'gt;study found that cattle grazed on the grasslands of China actually reduce another greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide, meaning that agriculture reduces this greenhouse gas.[4][5]I.C. Carbon DioxideThere are many proofs that this amount of carbon dioxide will not affect temperatures, but I will post four. But first, again, the wavelengths of light carbon dioxide absorbs also largely matches up with water vapor, meaning it also has little effect on temperature. First, by the greenhouse effect, global warming should be starting from the lower atmosphere and moving to the surface, but this is not happening: '... by Lucky Savings' href='#'gt;satellite and high-altitude balloon data confirm that the lower atmosphere is not trapping lots of additional heat due to higher CO2 concentrations. It is hard to know how fast the Earth's highly variable surface is warming, but it is warming faster than the lower atmosphere where the CO2 is accumulating. This is strong evidence that CO2 is not the primary climate factor.'[6]Here is a graph showing how the surface has warmed more than the troposphere: [1] (Blue line is troposphere temperatures)Second, CO2 is a lagging indicator. The most recent study on this concluded that the results of their tedious but meticulous analysis led them to ultimately conclude that 'the CO2 increase lagged Antarctic deglacial warming by 800 +/- 200 years.'[7][8]Here is a graph showing this:  [9]Third, CO2's effect on temperature is logarithmic, meaning that each additional increase has a smaller effect on the climate than the last. 'The carbon that is already up in the atmosphere absorbs most of the light it can. CO2 only soaks up its favorite wavelengths of light and it's close to its saturation point. It manages to grab a bit more light from wavelengths that are close to its favorite bands but it can't do much more, because there are not many left-over photons at the right wavelengths.'[1][9]Here is a graph showing the logarithmic curve:  [10]. Note how the pre-industrial to modern level increase has had less than a 0.2 C increase in temperature. Fourth, and most importantly, if greenhouse gases are warming the earth we are supposed to see the first signs of it in the patch of hot air 10 kilometers above the tropics. However, we don't see that. Here is the predicted 'hot spot' of greenhouse gas caused warming: [11]While here is the actual atmospheric temperature variation: [9][11]Even so, CO2 has not correlated well with the climate anyway. Throughout the past 600 million years, almost one-seventh of the age of the Earth, the mode of global surface temperatures was ~22C, even when carbon dioxide concentration peaked at 7000 ppmv, almost 20 times today's near-record-low concentration.[12]Here is a chart showing CO2 concentrations and temperatures over time:  [12]Overall, CO2 has a correlation coefficient of 0.44, which is considered poor.[13]II. The Hockey Stick The hockey stick is wildly inaccurate: 'The dataset used to make this construction contained collation errors, unjustified truncation or extrapolation of source data, obsolete data, incorrect principal component calculations, geographical mislocations and other serious defects. These errors and defects substantially affect the temperature index. The major finding is that the values in the early 15th century exceed any values in the 20th century. The particular hockey stick shape derived in the MBH98 proxy construction a temperature index that decreases slightly between the early 15th century and early 20th century and then increases dramatically up to 1980 is primarily an artefact of poor data handling, obsolete data and incorrect calculation of principal component.[1][14]Temperatures have been warmer than today as recently as 1300 ACE.'During the Medieval Warming... . Temperatures may have been as much as 2.5 degrees C warmer [than today] due to a southward shift of the climate belts.'[6]Here is a graph showing temperatures in Greenland over the last 10,000 years: [15]And on other side of the world in Antarctica: [15]Both clearly show that today's temperatures are relatively cool compared to earlier times. Why is the Medieval Warm Period not represented? 'A senior IPCC researcher said in an email 'We have to get rid of the Medieval Warm Period.' Christopher Monckton says 'They did this by giving one technique, measurement of tree-rings from bristlecone pines, 390 times more weighting than other techniques but didn't disclose this.'[1]The hockey stick has little credibility. III. Arctic Sea IceI'm not going to get so much into this since I already disproved that CO2 causes warming, but I will say two things. One, here is a graph showing geomagnetic field strength (a measure of solar activity) and CO2 versus temperature (a measure of sea ice loss):  [16]It is clear that solar activity is a lot more important than CO2 is in arctic ice loss. Two, my opponent neglects the Antarctic. If the greenhouse thoery were valid, temperatures in the Arctic and the Antarctic would have risen several degrees Celsius since 1940 due to the huge emissions of man-made CO2... Recently, a team led by the University of Chicago's Peter Doran published a paper in Nature saying, '...our spatial analysis of Antarctic meteorological data demonstrates a net cooling on the Antarctic continent between 1966 and 2000'. The data from 21 Antarctic surface stations show an average continental decline of 0.008 degrees C from 1978 to 1998, and the infrared data from satellites operating since 1979 show a decline of 0.42 degrees C per decade. They report that satellite imaging shows increases in Souther Ocean sea ice parameters from 1978 to 1996 and an increase in the length of the sea-ice season in the 1990s'[6]Here is the Antarctic Sea Ice anomaly:[17]It's increasing, which is a sign of cooling.</t>

    <t>For R3, I will focus on rebutting Con's R2.  'The Great Global Warming Swindle'  Much of my opponent's arguments basically borrows from ideas that haven't held up in a long while and are generally dismissed by the vast majority of climate change scientists. This article (6) in New Scientist articulately explains:  'Take the repeated claims that recent global warming is mostly or all due to solar changes. In 1991, for instance, a paper in Science (7) claimed there was a striking correlation between variations in the solar cycle length and temperature between 1880 and 1980, suggesting greenhouse gases have not played as big a role as thought. However, the correlation has not held up after 1980 (8). What is more, it turns out that the apparent correlation before 1980 is due to manipulation of the data (9). Despite being discredited, this graph is still being presented as evidence against human-induced global warming today (see The Great Global Warming Swindle entry in Wikipedia).  Similarly, studies suggesting that the lower atmosphere and the oceans are cooling, contrary to what climate models predict, have turned out to be wrong. Later studies have shown the apparent coolings to be a result of errors in equipment or calibration (See Sceptics forced into climate climb-down) (9).  By contrast, the famous 'hockey stick' graph has been the subject of a determined campaign to discredit it (see The hockey stick graph has been proven to be wrong) (10). Yet later temperature reconstructions and other evidence back the key conclusions of the original hockey stick study (See Climate: The great hockey stick debate.)'  Just How Much Influence DOES Solar Energy Have?  The big sticking point in our debate has been the issue of precisely how much influence the sun has on global warming. For this, we must look to what has been found by actual science (11):  'As supplier of almost all the energy in Earth's climate, the sun has a strong influence on climate. A comparison of sun and climate over the past 1150 years found temperatures closely match solar activity (Usoskin 2005). However, after 1975, temperatures rose while solar activity showed little to no long-term trend. This led the study to conclude, ''during these last 30 years the solar total irradiance, solar UV irradiance and cosmic ray flux has not shown any significant secular trend, so that at least this most recent warming episode must have another source.'  In fact, a number of independent measurements of solar activity indicate the sun has shown a slight cooling trend since 1960, over the same period that global temperatures have been warming. Over the last 35 years of global warming, sun and climate have been moving in opposite directions. An analysis of solar trends concluded that the sun has actually contributed a slight cooling influence in recent decades (Lockwood 2008).'  This conclusion is confirmed by many studies finding that while the sun contributed to warming in the early 20th Century, it has had little contribution (most likely negative) in the last few decades. For the purposes of space, these are just a few of the peer reviewed papers I can reference. I have more on demand:  Huber and Knutti (2011): 'Even for a reconstruction with high variability in total irradiance, solar forcing contributed only about 0.07'C (0.03-0.13'C) to the warming since 1950.'  Erlykin 2009: 'We deduce that the maximum recent increase in the mean surface temperature of the Earth which can be ascribed to solar activity is 14% of the observed global warming.'  Benestad 2009: 'Our analysis shows that the most likely contribution from solar forcing a global warming is 7 ' 1% for the 20th century and is negligible for warming since 1980.'  Lockwood 2008: 'It is shown that the contribution of solar variability to the temperature trend since 1987 is small and downward; the best estimate is -1.3% and the 2? confidence level sets the uncertainty range of -0.7 to -1.9%.'  Mars  Con appeals to the work of Khabibullo Abdusamatov (12):  'Abdussamatov claims that 'global warming results not from the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, but from an unusually high level of solar radiation and a lengthy'almost throughout the last century'growth in its intensity.'[4] This view contradicts the mainstream scientific opinion on climate change as well as accepted reconstructions of solar activity.[5][6][7] He has asserted that 'parallel global warmings'observed simultaneously on Mars and on Earth'can only be a straightline consequence of the effect of the one same factor: a long-time change in solar irradiance.'[8] This assertion has not been accepted by the broader scientific community, some of whom have stated that 'the idea just isn't supported by the theory or by the observations' and that it 'doesn't make physical sense.'[9][10]'  The above article puts it mildly about him being not widely accepted. He has zero papers published in peer review journals, he is a mathematician and astrophysicist ' not climatologist ' and is a well known cuckoo on CC denier lists. He is not even part of the mere 24 articles out of 13,950 peer reviewed articles on climate change between 1991-2012 that reject global warming (13), not that it would help his case much for as it is so delightfully put: 'Of one thing we can be certain: had any of these [24 peer reviewed] articles presented the magic bullet that falsifies human-caused global warming, that article would be on its way to becoming one of the most-cited in the history of science.'  But to tackle the actual Mars claim, let's again look at what the experts are saying (14):  'The Sun's energy output has not increased since direct measurements began in 1978 (see Climate myth special: Global warming is down to the Sun, not humans). If increased solar output really was responsible, we should be seeing warming on all the planets and their moons, not just Mars and Pluto.  One theory is that winds have recently swept some areas of Mars clean of dust, darkening the surface, warming the Red Planet and leading to further increases in windiness ' a positive feedback effect (see Dust blamed for warming on MarsMovie Camera).  There is a great deal of uncertainty, though. The warming could be a regional effect. And recent results from the thermal imaging system on the Mars Odyssey probe suggest that the polar cap is not shrinking at all, but varies greatly from one Martian year to the next, although the details have yet to be published.'  And also (15):  'Recently, there have been some suggestions that 'global warming' has been observed on Mars (e.g. here). These are based on observations of regional change around the South Polar Cap, but seem to have been extended into a 'global' change, and used by some to infer an external common mechanism for global warming on Earth and Mars (e.g. here and here). But this is incorrect reasoning and based on faulty understanding of the data.'  Thus, the Mars claims must also be considered thoroughly discounted. </t>

    <t>I would like to thank JonMilne for this great debate. I. The Sun My opponent is misrepresenting the evidence when he says that solar activity has dropped while temperatures have increased. As this article explains: 'The cycles in the late 20th [century] were short, ~10 years, and high compared to the long term average of ~40 SSN. The minima between them were short too. So although they did reduce in absolute amplitude after the '50s, they made up for it by kicking out more energy more of the time.'[1][2] Here is a graph showing sunspot activity over the last 1000 years: [3] Notice how sunspots were more numerous during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), less numerous during the Little Ice Age (LIA), and another 'hockey stick' forms at the start of the 20th century. What a coincidence.  A better way to look at the solar influence on climate is to look at a new statistic. Between raw solar activity (solar irradiance) and temperature, temperature lags about 7.5-10 years behind solar irradiance because of the heat capacity of the oceans. A better representation of the sun/temperature correlation is the length of the solar cycle. 'This new parameter not only indicated a remarkably high correlation coefficient between solar activity and temperature (on the order of 0.95), but it also eliminated the problem of the 7-year lag encountered by Reid.'[4][5][6] This is a close-up of the above graph: [6] Notice how solar activity falls around 1990, which, after 7.5-10 years (1999 to be exact) is manifested in a slight temperature drop.  Further, here is a graph showing solar irradiance itself compared to temperature: [9] While here is temperature compared with sunspot cycle length: [10] The correlation coefficent increases from 0.57 to 0.95, which are both greater than CO2's correlation of 0.44 (0 is no correlation, 1 is total correlation).  When looking at all of how the sun affects the climate: 'For example, the authors of a paper by NASA's JPL remark '...has compared the minimum aa [index of geomagnetic activity] values with the Earth's surface temperature record and found a correlation of 0.95 between the two data sets starting in 1885. The solar irradiance [solar activity] proxy developed from the aa minima continues to track the Earth's surface temperature until the present.''[7][8] In other words, using the better formulation produces an almost perfect correlation between solar activity and temperature. 'If the Scafetta and West analysis used the uncontaminated satellite data since 1980, the results would show that the Sun has contributed at least 75% of the global warming of the last century.''In particular, a quasi-60-year large cycle is quite evident since 1650 in all climate and astronomical records herein studied ... The existence of a natural 60-year cyclical modulation of the global surface temperature induced by astronomical mechanisms, by alone, would imply that at least 60 to 70% of the warming observed since 1970 has been naturally induced.'[6][11][12]  II. Extraterrestrial Bodies While yes, that particular study focused on the south pole of Mars, the whole planet is indeed warming: 'A recent study shows that Mars is warming four times faster than the Earth. Mars is warming due to increased Sun activity, which increases dust storms. The study's authors led by Lori Fenton, a planetary scientist at NASA, says the dust makes the atmosphere absorb more heat causing a positive feedback. Surface air temperatures on Mars increased by 0.65 C (1.17 F) from the 1970s to the 1990s.'[6] Here is a list of just some of the solar system's reactions to increased solar activity:  Sun - Recent Activity Highest in 8000 Years [meaning it's not just the 11-year cycle] and magnetic field has decreased in size by 25% 300% increase in galactic dust entering solar system Mercury - magnetosphere experiencing significant increases Venus  - 2500% Increase in Green Glow Mars - Rapid Appearance of Clouds, Ozone and Up to 50% Erosion of Ice Features in one year alone Jupiter - Plasma Torus increasing and Jupiter's Disappearance of White Ovals since 1997, recent increase in storms Io - 'observing same changes -' 200% Increase in Density of Plasma Torus and Ionosphere 1000% Higher Europa - Much Brighter Than Expected Ganymede - 200% brighter Saturn's - Plasma Torus 1000% Denser andAurora First Seen in polar regions in recent years Uranus - featureless in 1996, now exhibiting huge storms since 1999 and markedly brighter in 2004 than in 1999 Neptune - 40% Brighter, Near Infrared Range 1996 - 2002 Triton - Severe atmospheric changes, warming Pluto - 300% increase in atmospheric pressure.[13]  In addition, here is hard evidence that the moon is warming: [14]Further, this shows the comparison between the Sun's, the Earth's, and Neptune's activity:     [6] It is clear that not only is Neptune warming, it is doing so in the same fashion as the Earth's temperature and the Sun's activity, indicating a correlation between the events that is not caused by CO2III. Other Arguments First, my opponent claims that tropospheric temperatures have not decreased. 'However, since January 2002, the temperatures have been declining at 0.16 C/decade for UAH and 0.24 C/decade for the RSS data.' This graph shows two analyses of Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) satellite temperature measurement data (which is very reliable, compared to surface thermometers) of the troposphere over the tropics from 20 degrees North to 20 degrees South: [6] Second, my opponent claims that the oceans aren't cooling. However, 'Two separate studies through NASA confirm that since 2003, the world's oceans have been losing heat.'[15] Also, the PDO graph in R2 confirms this, as the PDO is going into a cool cycle.  Third, my opponent claims that the hockey stick is reliable. I touched on this more in R3, but I will add this: 'They used a computer model to draw the graph from the data, but two Canadians [Ross McKitrick and Stephen McIntyre] later found that the model almost always drew hockey-sticks even if they fed in random, electronic 'red noise' because it used a faulty algorithm.' The MBH 1998 report was never properly peer reviewed before the IPCC used it in their publications.'[6][16]Conclusion  The AGW theory makes several incorrect predictions, and the Earth's warming correlates with solar actiivty, not CO2.</t>

<h>I thank my opponent for accepting my challenge.   It [Global Warming] is the greatest and most successful pseudoscientific fraud I have seen in my long life as a physicist -Harold Lewis   Billions of dollars are spent every year in Global Warming research, another typical money waste if you ask me. I do not believe the people behind it actuallyve in this pseudo-science, they are fabricating it, and fabrication this big is not just a 'scam', a fabrication this big wants to bring change. That change can range from a few political seats to some evo-fascism, something like what the UN's Agenda 21 would want.  Before I begin, ask yourself this question: What did the green movement accomplish? Collecting money? What is their biggest achievement? Does it involve getting mega-bucks? Why do 1-percenter green movement powerhouses own oil companies? Why is Al-Gore's carbon foot print sky high?   I do find global warming quite silly. It predicts that heat will flow from the atmosphere to the warmer ground. And this violates the second law of thermodynamics.    1-Statistics: Believe it or not, but statistics aren't on the Global Warming's side. The IPCC have been quite creative, but that ain't enough. I will get to it later.  #1   http://www.geocraft.com...   Sure, there aren't many statistics comparing human and natural sources for the GHGs, but which side he billions of dollars invested in order to prove something exists?  It is no secret that nature's GHGs dwarfs man-made GHGs. The chart is accurate enough:   http://www.thinkglobalgreen.org...  Currently general agreement is that 95% of GHG (Greenhouse Gases) are caused by water vapor, and 99.999% of that is of natural origin. We can do little about it.        The claim is: We are disturbing natural balance of the 4.5 billion years old planet and it won't be able to take it due to it's pathetically fragile system. A large portation of this claim may only need a ninth grader to debunk it.   Water Vapour: How big a facor is water? I mean the percentage of water in the atmosphere gets change constantly but we don't witness change in the temperature.  There is a reason it is added list of GHGs. Water is really good at reflecting and absorbing light amp; radiations. In fact, it blows CO2 out of the water (no pun intended).  Collection of quotes admitting it:  http://scienceofdoom.com...    #2    Bring me a source that claims CO2 have a better absorption ability than H2O. They imply that water have some kind of a cycle that makes CO2's effect bigger. Guess what? Water absorbs gasses, adding water to CO2 will create a vacuum. How do you think acid rains are created? How do you think sea creatures create shells? The effect is called 'Carbon Sink'. Read something about it.  http://jennifermarohasy.com... Simple experiment above.  Acid rains take between hours to days to form. Not HUNDREDS of years for the GHGs to FINALLY react to water. It is all simple science.  Try standing on a scale with an ant. Thats H2O against CO2. How does Global Warming pseudo-science explain that? I have no clue...     CO2:First thing you need to know is that carbon is at a State of Equilibrium. That is the point of natural cycles That is the basis of Carbon-14 dating method. If it increases in the atmosphere, there is acid rain. If it increases in oceans, there is sedimentation. And eventually, volcanoes will release the carbonate as CO2.      #3     http://noconsensus.wordpress.com...   Soil CO2: http://www.independent.co.uk...   It may even cause plants to reach their potential: http://articles.baltimoresun.com...    Second of all, it is heavy:   CO2 Mol mass: 44.01 g per Mol CO2 Density: 1.96 KG/m3 Gravity: 1.5189  Air = 28 g per Mol Air Density : 1.2 KG/m3 Gravity: 1  H2O = 18 g per Mol H2O Density : 0.75 kg-m3 Gravity: 0.62   There is a reason there are no plants before there is no oxygen while climbing mountains. That is most of the CO2 is in oceans. Just look at the properties, it is a mess. I need an explanation of how CO2 can get from down here all the way up.   http://news.nationalgeographic.com...     http://www.theregister.co.uk... http://www.theregister.co.uk...   Where is the warming? There is no scientific proof that man-made CO2 causes global warming. Did the surface temperature warm yet? Oh! It didn’t.   The Venus argument: Might aswell mention it here. Other than being a logical fallacy with funny counter-examples. It is completely incorrect and based on false assumptions. If we use the IPCC’s (false) formula, CO2 may only heat it up by 38C, so how come it is hotter than Mercury and have a degree 482C? Because it is a different planet. Infact, CO2 may even cool the planet since Venus have 30-40Km thick clouds that blocks most of the sun’s radiation. That’s why there is little difference in heat between day and night in Venus. Venus have a very weak magnetic field, it takes the planet 246 days to rotate on it’s axis, so all the molten magma is not suppressed and the thousands of volcanoes goes ahoy.         2-What does What again? Global warming does whatever it feels likes. And I am not talking about the “scary” failed apocalypse prophecies. Global warming does everything! It makes ice melt, it makes ice thicken. Decide on something already!   http://www.theregister.co.uk...   http://www.realclimate.org...   http://www.usatoday.com...     I might as well start a theory about “Global Cooling”… Ops… It was invented in the 70s… Lets cut the hypocrisy already…   Cow Fart-Gas gt; Human transportation GHG http://science.howstuffworks.com... http://timeforchange.org...   So we should eat less meat! http://www.guardian.co.uk...   Heck, we should be like this woman: http://www.dailymail.co.uk... We exhale CO2 (Shocker...)       3-The missing link: Contrary to the popular belief, evolution isn’t the only one in the manhunt.   According to geological ice sample study, the earth is in a period of cooling and warming.    #4   I am not a climate change denier (Ironic right?). There is nothing we can do against nature.     The recent history’s hottest period is 2000 years ago, which is before cigarettes were invented (So you may scratch that out as a cause). http://www.dailymail.co.uk... Whats that? I’d almost say humans have nothing to do with it. The world was NOT flooded back then, and it won’t start flooding now.         4-The trustworthy IPCC: Calling the IPCC trustworthy is a relative statement. But according to an average hillie billie’s standards, the IPCC is the furthest from “Trustworthy”. The IPCC does not even do research, the fact they have been caught faking so many times is enough.   http://wattsupwiththat.com... http://tucsoncitizen.com...      #5   http://www.dailymail.co.uk...

    <t>First of all, I don't approve of the people that know the advantages of going green and choose to ignore it. I can understand when someone isn't educated. Also, the crowd that chooses to block all advances into green tech by saying "global warming isn't real" had better really look into the advantages of green tech. You may have noticed that this is under the "Money" category, which is it's right place to be.            The main advantage of going green (with the exception of saving the environment) is the amount of money it will save you. Now, initially, buying green technology is more expensive than other, more non-green, options. This is usually the case. Why would anyone buy a slightly more expensive item when you can get a similar item for less?           Ironically, savings. "Green" items almost always cost less than non-green items to use once installed. For example, say you run a business, which is large and is centered in a large building. You have good profits, but the energy bill really cuts deep into your wallet. Would you rather: A) Not pay to have anything installed, but have the large energy costs B)Pay for some insulation, and have smaller energy costs from then on If you picked A, you're probably Mr. Krabs or unintelligent, and if you picked B, you made the right choice. There are many ways to save on energy bills by using green tech.            You could use more effective insulation and put insulation where there isn't any, you could use LEDs (those swirly light bulbs are hazardous and require special disposal, I wouldn't recommend those), put in a solar water heater, use double-paned windows, use a solar light, or even go old-school and open a window instead of turning on the air conditioner. There are extreme measures, like installing a wind turbine, small hydro-electric generator, etc.           While going green may seem unnecessary and wasteful, it really isn't bad at all. While you can appease the environmental crowd, you would actually be making an economical choice and be helping yourself. Using a few green methods, you make your wallet fatter, and who doesn't like that?</t>

    <t>People are constantly using the explanation "global warming isn't real" to put off going green. They either don't realize or don't care enough that going green is an excellent money saving tool, letting you keep YOUR money in YOUR pocket.</t>
<h>Please note that my opponent have failed to respond to any of my arguments or challenges, I gave him the option to defend and create arguments against different aspects of criticism on Global Warming, and yet. We still have the Co2 weight problem, the thermodynamic laws problem, the water vapor percentage and absorption problem, the history problem, the fraud problem, the corruption problem. Cramming those up objections against the theory and putting them aside, like our friend here did, shows failure to respond and defend. Which brings us to these annoying emotional argument.And you want the Co2 ppm to get lower than this? You do realize plants can't preform photosynthesis with 150-200 Co2 ppm right?http://cdn5.theweedblog.com...I'd say the concentration is quite balanced since there is no gument that the current Co2 concentration is harmful.1-Law of thermodynamics:1- The warm earth surface radiates heat to the cooler atmosphere.2- The cool body (uphysically) re-radiates the heat it got back to the warm body.3- This continuous process's net result causes the warmer body to become warmer.http://www.grc.nasa.gov...The earth is not an isolated system, the earth is not flat. The cooling happens at night, the rate of 240 W/m^2 is not going to change because of 0.000390 Co2. Just bring me one thermodynamic text that mentions 'Back/reflected heat radiations', it is impossible for a cooler body to warm the source of it's heat.It is true that all bodies releases radiations, but the earth surface's radiation is 10 times stronger than the atmosphere's radiation. Result: The earth cools, not get 11 times the atmosphere's radiations back.2-Co2 weight: CO2 Mol mass: 44.01 g per Mol CO2 Density: 1.96 KG/m3 Gravity: 1.5189  Air = 28 g per Mol Air Density : 1.2 KG/m3 Gravity: 1  H2O = 18 g per Mol H2O Density : 0.75 kg-m3 Gravity: 0.62 Gravity is almost constant at your everyday heights. What I want to know is how Co2 is going to get down here all the way to the atmosphere. Why do ocean hold the majority of Co2?3-Absorption:http://cosmoscon.files.wordpress.com...Water absorption infrared radiations MUCH more than Co2, how can GW be man-made if such a thing exists?Not to mention that it is 24,400 ppm.I was planning to watch a horror movie soon, but what the hell. I have that article Con copy pasted. *Brings popcorn*===We first kick it off with a temperature lie. Nice try associating a weather extreme to GW, I mean they never existed in the past n'all... Oh wait...The second paragraph is so full of logical fallacies.According to the Overseas Development Institute, Finland was covered by broadleaf forests 6000 years ago. Therefore, I conclude that an increase in 1C is going to fill the earth with forests! Point?The author pretty much admits that Anthropogenic climate change doesn't exist here. And nice of him to point out that this article is solely based on imagination amp; lala land fantasy.*Fictional Scenario Begins*!Omg! The Amazon flooded! Nature extreme!

'Ninety-seven percent of climate scientists agree that climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities, and most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position' 'All three major global surface temperature reconstructions show that Earth has warmed since 1880.5 Most of this warming has occurred since the 1970s, with the 20 warmest years having occurred since 1981 and with all 10 of the warmest years occurring in the past 12 years.6 Even though the 2000s witnessed a solar output decline resulting in an unusually deep solar minimum in 2007-2009, surface temperatures continue to increase'  Emission Scenarios (SRES), by the end of the 21st century, we could expect to see carbon dioxide concentrations of anywhere from 490 to 1260 ppm (75-350% above the pre-industrial concentration).  50 years ago nobody had to wear sunscreen.  http://www.scientificamerican.com...

    <t>with the Co2 ppm it was 7000ppm in the Cambrian but it should be decreasing not increasing. 'Even if greenhouse emissions stopped overnight the concentrations already in the atmosphere would still mean a global rise of between 0.5 and 1C. A shift of a single degree is barely perceptible to human skin, but it's not human skin we're talking about. It's the planet; and an average increase of one degree across its entire surface means huge changes in climatic extremes.  Six thousand years ago, when the world was one degree warmer than it is now, the American agricultural heartland around Nebraska was desert. It suffered a short reprise during the dust- bowl years of the 1930s, when the topsoil blew away and hundreds of thousands of refugees trailed through the dust to an uncertain welcome further west. The effect of one-degree warming, therefore, requires no great feat of imagination.  'The western United States once again could suffer perennial droughts, far worse than the 1930s. Deserts will reappear particularly in Nebraska, but also in eastern Montana, Wyoming and Arizona, northern Texas and Oklahoma. As dust and sandstorms turn day into night across thousands of miles of former prairie, farmsteads, roads and even entire towns will be engulfed by sand.'  What's bad for America will be worse for poorer countries closer to the equator. It has beencalculated that a one-degree increase would eliminate fresh water from a third of the world's land surface by 2100. Again we have seen what this means. There was an incident in the summer of 2005: One tributary fell so low that miles of exposed riverbank dried out into sand dunes, with winds whipping up thick sandstorms. As desperate villagers looked out onto baking mud instead of flowing water, the army was drafted in to ferry precious drinking water up the river ' by helicopter, since most of the river was too low to be navigable by boat. The river in question was not some small, insignificant trickle in Sussex. It was the Amazon.  While tropical lands teeter on the brink, the Arctic already may have passed the point of no return. Warming near the pole is much faster than the global average, with the result that Arctic icecaps and glaciers have lost 400 cubic kilometres of ice in 40 years. Permafrost ' ground that has lain frozen for thousands of years ' is dissolving into mud and lakes, destabilising whole areas as the ground collapses beneath buildings, roads and pipelines. As polar bears and Inuits are being pushed off the top of the planet, previous predictions are starting to look optimistic. Earlier snowmelt means more summer heat goes into the air and ground rather than into melting snow, raising temperatures in a positive feedback effect. More dark shrubs and forest on formerly bleak tundra means still more heat is absorbed by vegetation.  Out at sea the pace is even faster. Whilst snow-covered ice reflects more than 80% of the sun's heat, the darker ocean absorbs up to 95% of solar radiation. Once sea ice begins to melt, in other words, the process becomes self-reinforcing. More ocean surface is revealed, absorbing solar heat, raising temperatures and making it unlikelier that ice will re-form next winter. The disappearance of 720,000 square kilometres of supposedly permanent ice in a single year testifies to the rapidity of planetary change. If you have ever wondered what it will feel like when the Earth crosses a tipping point, savour the moment.'  every 1 degree gained at the equator is 12 degrees gained at the poles  'the end of the world is nigh. A three-degree increase in global temperature ' possible as early as 2050 ' would throw the carbon cycle into reverse. Instead of absorbing carbon dioxide, vegetation and soils start to release it. So much carbon pours into the atmosphere that it pumps up atmospheric concentrations by 250 parts per million by 2100, boosting global warming by another 1.5C. In other words, the Hadley team had discovered that carbon-cycle feedbacks could tip the planet into runaway global warming by the middle of this century ' much earlier than anyone had expected. '  we may be only 3.5% of the problem with our output but our output is also making nature output more by 2100 north America will have the same water problem as Africa war will break out for the last bits of fresh water  with the water rising they measure the water level at the equator and water flows from the equator to the poles and water is rising 7m there. Rome is in danger of flooding. </t>

What I want to know is how Co2 is going to get down here all the way to the atmosphere. Why do ocean hold the majority of Co2? 3-Absorption. Water absorption infrared radiations MUCH more than Co2, how can GW be man-made if such a thing exists?Not to mention that it is 24,400 ppm.I was planning to watch a horror movie soon, but what the hell. I have that article Con copy pasted. *Brings popcorn*===We first kick it off with a temperature lie. Nice try associating a weather extreme to GW, I mean they never existed in the past n'all... Oh wait...The second paragraph is so full of logical fallacies.According to the Overseas Development Institute, Finland was covered by broadleaf forests 6000 years ago. Therefore, I conclude that an increase in 1C is going to fill the earth with forests! Point?The author pretty much admits that Anthropogenic climate change doesn't exist here. And nice of him to point out that this article is solely based on imagination amp; lala land fantasy.*Fictional Scenario Begins*!Omg! The Amazon flooded! Nature extreme! GLOBAL WARMING! Oh wait... That is the opposite of the article... Does this mean it is GLOBAL COOLING! 1/3 of fresh water will freeze! The end is nigh!I am not too sure about 'no return'. It shrinks and then... Grows right up! Maybe GW is taking breaks?The Polar bears trick is still being used? Wicked. Who cares about what water absorbs, there is man-made Co2! And wow! I never knew the heat water absorbs become sustainable!Humans sheds 4 kilograms of skins per year! OMG we are dying!Yay! An other Global Warming/Cooling dooms day prophecy!. And by Hadley you mean the center that leaked the climate gate emails?I love how he mentioned Rome. Why just Rome? He wants to band Catholics in order to protect the Vatican or something? lol.Global Warming have none, zero, nada proof. Removing 75% of the world’s stations with a clear bias towards removing higher latitude, high altitude and rural locations, all of which had a tendency to be cooler?Tampering with data? I am not sure the heck that is. But it is not science.Please bring me something useful next time. Thank you!</t>

Leave the guy alone with the mega-bucks he earned, his oil company, and his gigantic carbon footprint.The Co2 ppm is meaningless until you explain how Co2 does Global Warming. For example, during the Cambrian period, Co2 ppm was 18 times higher than today, the 7000 ppm did not invent Venus #2.The early graphs of Co2 increase are a fraud, they doctored and selected data to make a scary graph. If you don't start a graph from a zero, it will look sharp.The glacier bubbles will have a lower concentration of Co2. Not only do Global Warming alarmists defend the manipulated graphs, but they also claim that the Co2 level never rose above 300ppm for x0,000 years. But oops, fossils records proves you wrong. How did the Co2 increase that much without humans?. Please show me how Co2 beats H2O.How possibly can we cause a change of 350% by the end of the century when we only contribute a tiny 3.5% of the Co2?

As for the sea level, it is a myth (like global warming!). 1/3 of Netherlands rises above sea level! That's an other IPCC mistake. The IPPC also added the area that could be venerable to flooding, that way the statistics would look more scary.Listen...

'Ninety-seven percent of climate scientists agree that climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities, and most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position' 'All three major global surface temperature reconstructions show that Earth has warmed since 1880.5 Most of this warming has occurred since the 1970s, with the 20 warmest years having occurred since 1981 and with all 10 of the warmest years occurring in the past 12 years.6 Even though the 2000s witnessed a solar output decline resulting in an unusually deep solar minimum in 2007-2009, surface temperatures continue to increase'  Emission Scenarios (SRES), by the end of the 21st century, we could expect to see carbon dioxide concentrations of anywhere from 490 to 1260 ppm (75-350% above the pre-industrial concentration).  50 years ago nobody had to wear sunscreen. During the 20th century, sea level rose an average of 7 inches after 2,000 years of relatively little change.

<h>I would like to thank Citrakayah for accepting this debate. I. Natural Factors Point to Little or No Change In The Climate I.A. The SunThe sun is the main driver of the global climate. The level of activity from the sun correlates with the average global temperature. The sun is currently decreasing in activity, meaning that the warming of the 1970s-1990s will soon be erased. 'Changes in the Sun can account for major climate changes on Earth for the past 300 years, including part of the recent surge of global warming.'[1] The sun can account for most of the warming experienced over the past century, and correlates well with the rising and falling of temperatures when compared to 20th century temperatures:  [2]I.A.1. Solar Flux PredictionsSolar activity has been declining for a little over a decade and will continue to do so for at least the foreseeable future. ''Normally, the conveyor belt moves about 1 meter per second—walking pace,' says Hathaway, 'That's how it has been since the late 19th century.' In recent years, however, the belt has decelerated to 0.75 m/s in the north and 0.35 m/s in the south. 'We've never seen speeds so low.''[19] This means that solar activity has been declining recently. The next solar cycle, number 25, is projected to be one of the lowest in centuries.[19] 'Storms from the sun are expected to build to a peak in 2013 or so, but after that, the long-range indicators are pointing to an extended period of low activity — or even hibernation.'[3] In fact, we are already beginning to experience this lowered solar activity.[5][6]This graph illustrates the recent decline in solar activity. Note the downward trend in solar activity overtime:  [4]With solar activity leveling off, temperatures will go back down to normal. In addition, there will be fewer hazardous rays coming from the sun and fewer solar storms, meaning fewer disruptions to the satellite systems we rely on so heavily. I.A.2. Cosmic Ray FluxWith decreased solar activity, there is increased cosmic ray penetration of the Earth's atmosphere. Cosmic rays are inversely proportional to solar activity and proportional to cloud cover; and greater cloud cover means cooler temperatures.[19][10][11] I.A.3. Ocean Currents Ocean currents are the main internal drivers of the global climate. They have an R-squared correlation of 0.83, which is pretty significant (the highest score is 1).[7] Here is a chart showing ocean current's correlation to temperatures:   [7] The sun is the main driver of ocean current temperatures, 'This [solar activity] is the single most important cause [of ocean currents and their temperatures]. The Sun provides the bulk of the energy which drives the circulation of water in the oceans, either directly or indirectly (through winds). The uneven distribution of solar energy across the globe (highest at the equator, decreasing towards the poles) produces an uneven heating of water in the ocean.'[20] When plotted together, solar activity and ocean current activity correlate well (notice the decline in solar activity after WWII, and the subsequent fall in ocean current activity around the same time).[2][7][8]Ocean currents, because of the sun's cooling and because of its natural three-decade cycles of warm and cool, ocean currents are projected to cool down further than today and to continue that pattern for at least another few decades. 'Because PDO cycles last 25 to 30 years, Easterbrook expects the cooling trend to continue for another 2 decades or so.'[9] Here is a graph showing ocean current's temperatures since 1900:     [8]Note how all three currents are experiencing decreasing temperature trends, which, due to their current short duration, should continue for at least two more decades, and then another few decades to get back (possibly) to a peak. With decreased solar activity causing lower ocean current temperatures, the Earth will cool somewhat over at least the next few decades, albeit it shouldn't be that much. The climate will stay around normal. I.B. The 1500-Year CycleThere exists a 1500-year climatic cycle of peak-trough-peak (or vice versa) temperature cycles. 'Through at least the last million years, a moderate 1500-year warm-cold cycle has been superimposed over the longer, stronger Ice Ages and warm interglacials.'[12]Here is an illustration of this cycle:  [13] This warm trend is projected to continue for around a few more centuries, and then the cycle will flip into a cold pattern.[12] This warm period will help counterbalance some of the effects of a diminishing sun. As solar activity does its ups and downs, the counterbalance between the Earth and the Sun will help keep Earth's climate systems in check. The various natural factors contributed by solar activity and the Earth's 1500-year cycle point to an insignificant change in the Earth's climate. Temperatures should not be much higher or lower than they usually are on average over the next few centuries. While the sun is cooling, the Earth will continue to heat the planet somewhat until solar activity returns and we have another temperature rise. It's a rise-and-fall situation.II. Positive Effects of the Current Interglacial and Warm PeriodA moderately warm period is better than a cold period. If the temperature is not too warm, a warm climate can have positive effects on both the Earth as a whole and on everyone. II.A. Health EffectsIn moderation, warm temperatures are better for the body than cold temperatures. People cannot get enough heat, infections are rampant, and hospital admissions will rise in the cold. From 1979 to 1997, extreme cold killed roughly twice as many Americans as heat waves [coincidentally when the Earth was heating up].[14][12] In Germany, heat waves were found to reduce overall mortality rates slightly, while cold spells led to a significant increase in deaths.[15][12] In addition, warmer weather decreases incidences of strokes, respiratory diseases, and the flu.[12]In general, life expectancies are higher in warmer climates, and there are fewer incidences of disease and other health problems. A warm period would be beneficial to human health. II.B. Economic BenefitsSome of the major industrial sectors, particularly agriculture, tend to work better in a warmer environment than they do in a cooler environment. 'The book [The Impact of Climate Change] finds that a moderate warming will have a positive economic impact on the agriculture and forestry sectors. Since carbon dioxide is used by plants to capture and store energy, there may be a fertilizing effect as levels of the gas rise. This, combined with longer growing seasons, fewer frosts and more precipitation, among other factors, could benefit some economic sectors.'[16][17]CO2 increases, a byproduct of temperature increases ([12]), naturally help to stimulate plant growth as well, further helping agriculture. 'For a 300 ppm increase in the atmosphere's CO2 concentration above the planet's current base level of slightly less than 400 ppm, for example, the productivity of earth's herbaceous plants rises by something on the order of 30%, while the productivity of its woody plants rises by something on the order of 50%.'[18][21]This further helps humans by increasing food yields, lowering rates of starvation and hunger. Conclusion There should be an insignificant change in the climate over the next couple of centuries as the sun continues its cycles and the Earth is in a moderately warm period. In the short term, the major factors in the climate show a decrease in temperature, but the long term shows a stabilization of temperatures to a reasonably warm level. This increases humans' life expectancies and increases crop yields, reducing the incidence of hunger, thereby further aiding in the increases in life expectancies. There is no rational reason to worry about the climate going off the deep end in the near future. On the contrary, our current climatic state seems to be helping us. Sourceshttp://tny.cz...</h>

    <t>I would like tothank Citrakayah for presenting his arguments. Before I begin my rebuttals, I would like to confirm that I deny the existance of short-term (i.e. right now) global warming. (NOTE: Unfortunately, the graphs feature won't work. Public HealthMy opponent is working on a hypothetical here – that just because global warming is happening means that tropical disease rates will increase. However, as I have shown, over the next few decades, temperatures should decrease, meaning a 'decrease' in tropical disease rates. But even if the planet was warming, there shouldn’t be a cause for concern over higher disease rates. Over the last century, tropical disease rates have not correlated with global warming. Take, for example, malaria. Rates of malaria have decreased (or were marginally affected) in almost all locations around the globe, even as temperatures have risen (Graph 1; [1]).The fact is that malaria does not really care about temperature. When the world was cooler during the 'Little Ice Age', malaria was far more rampant than it ever has been today. Even though the Earth has warmed in the 20th century, tropical disease rates are at all time lows.[2] Really, these diseases aren’t tropical. Even in the 20th century, Archangel, Russia was having 10,000+ deaths from malaria.[3] The correlation just isn’t there. Science reports that the supposed correlation between tropical disease and global warming is 'purely speculative'.[4][5] 'A warm climate is a necessary condition for the mosquitoes that can carry malaria and dengue fever but is not a sufficient condition for the diseases to become epidemic.'[2] What really causes epidemics is improper regulations and poverty. For example, in Peru, when water chlorination was banned, cholera cases skyrocketed. In Sri Lanka, when DDT was banned, malaria cases skyrocketed. Or take Singapore and Malaysia. They are in the same general location, but Singapore had zero malaria deaths and Malaysia had 36853 cases of it.[3] It is clear that tropical disease rates correlate with improper regulations and poverty, not global warming. As for the increased amount of heat waves, more heat is actually beneficial, as I mentioned in the last round. In Germany, heat waves have actually been shown to reduce mortality rates, while cold spells significantly increase them.[6][7] For the UK, 'For the UK, the Keatinge studies show heat-related deaths caused by global warming will increase by 2,000. But cold-related deaths will decrease by 20,000.'[8] Global warming will save more than it will kill.II. Sea Level Rise  Even though some groups like to show scenes of global apocalypse with this, the truth is that the sea level hasn’t risen that much. However, both past and predicted rise have been greatly exaggerated (Graph 2; [10]). The linear trend shows a sea level rise of only 1.31 +/- 0.30 mm/year. 'The Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory estimates the rate of sea level rise at 1.42 plus or minus 0.14 mm/year for the period 1954 to 2003. This is less than the estimate of 1.91 plus or minus 0.14 mm/year for the period 1902 to 1953, indicating a slowing of the rate.'[9][10] That’s an increase of around 2.8 inches in the last 50 years – not that much of an apocalyptic scenario.Future sea level predictions are even better. As of currently, global ocean heat content has not changed in recent years (Graph 3; [11]). Sea level itself has actually been declining for the last decade (Graph 4; [10]).The ‘INQUA Commission on Sea-Level Change and Coastal Evolution’ led by Dr. Morner, prepared as estimate that the global sea level will rise 10 cm plus or minus 10 cm in the next 100 years. Dr. Morner has since revised his estimate to 5 cm per 100 years after considering data of the Sun activity suggesting that the warming trend may have ended and the Earth may be headed into a cooling trend.”[10][12][13] That’s around 2.5 inches in the next 100 years. That’s really not too bad.  As for Tuvalu, sea level has actually dropped four inches in the last 20 years and there is no evidence based on the observations that sea level rise there is accelerating.[13][14]In general, there is no cause for concern here.III. Ocean AcidificationFears here are also greatly exaggerated. The mean drop in pH levels as a result of CO2 increases is around 0.3, but the sea can experience changes of almost 1.4 in as little as just a day. 'On a monthly scale the pH varies by 0.024 to 1.430 pH units.' 'At Puerto Morelos (in Mexico’s easternmost state, on the Yucatán Peninsula) the pH varied as much as 0.3 units per hour due to groundwater springs.' 'Even the more stable and vast open ocean is not a fixed pH all year round. Hofmann writes that 'Open-water areas (in the Southern Ocean) experience a strong seasonal shift in seawater pH (~0.3–0.5 units) between austral summer and winter.''[15][16]  This is the paper's hypothesis: 'This natural variability has prompted the suggestion that an appropriate null hypothesis may be, until evidence is obtained to the contrary, that major biogeochemical processes in the oceans other than calcification will not be fundamentally different under future higher CO2/lower pH conditions'[15][16]In addition, increased CO2 levels can help shell formation: “We also know that adding CO2 in a sense is feeding the calcifying organisms (like it feeds life above the water too). CO2 dissolves as bicarbonate, which marine uses to make skeletons and shells from. So yes, a lower pH dissolves shells, but the extra CO2 increases shell formation.'[17][16]  In general, increased CO2 concentrations don't affect pH levels any more than pH levels change on a daily basis. They can even help in the production of shells.  IV. Cloud Forests First, cloud forests, and specifically, the one my opponent cites, the Monteverde cloud forests, are not being affected by global warming. In the case of the Monteverde cloud forest, it was the clearing of the lowland forests under the cloud forest that changed the pattern of cloud formation, not warming. In fact, the cloud forests in nearby Nicaragua were unaffected because there was no lowland deforestation. Deforestation, not warming, caused changes in the cloud forests.[7][21]Now on to drought affects. Drought frequency, in the face of warming, has not increased over the past 100 years (Graph 5; [10]). The US has not gotten any drier in the last 100 years. Pederson et al. found that droughts during the end of the Little Ice Age were more severe and of longer duration than those of the 20th and 21st centuries. Cooler climates produced more extreme conditions in many parts of the world. Woodhouse et al. published a 1,200 year perspective of Southwestern North America droughts: 'The medieval period was characterized by widespread and regionally severe, sustained drought... Proxy data documenting drought indicate centuries-long periods of increased aridity across the central and western U.S...The recent drought, thus far, pales hydrologically in comparison.'[18][19][10] Droughts tend to coincide with periods of high solar activity, so since solar activity is decreasing, drought frequency should decrease further. In fact, increased heat means more precipitation, as more moisture evaporates from the oceans and then falls as rain or snow. NASA says global rainfall increased 2 percent in the 20th century compared with the tail-end of the Little Ice Age in the 19th century. Most of the increased moisture fell in the mid and high latitudes where much of the world’s most productive cropland is located. This should continue as time goes on.[20][13] Conclusion Most of the problems my opponent highlights are greatly exaggerated, and since I have shown that temperatures should increase only slightly in the long-term, they should not be of any concern over the next few centuries.</t>

As solar activity does its ups and downs, the counterbalance between the Earth and the Sun will help keep Earth's climate systems in check. The various natural factors contributed by solar activity and the Earth's 1500-year cycle point to an insignificant change in the Earth's climate. Temperatures should not be much higher or lower than they usually are on average over the next few centuries. While the sun is cooling, the Earth will continue to heat the planet somewhat until solar activity returns and we have another temperature rise. It's a rise-and-fall situation.II. Positive Effects of the Current Interglacial and Warm PeriodA moderately warm period is better than a cold period. If the temperature is not too warm, a warm climate can have positive effects on both the Earth as a whole and on everyone. II.A. Health EffectsIn moderation, warm temperatures are better for the body than cold temperatures. People cannot get enough heat, infections are rampant, and hospital admissions will rise in the cold. From 1979 to 1997, extreme cold killed roughly twice as many Americans as heat waves [coincidentally when the Earth was heating up].[14][12] In Germany, heat waves were found to reduce overall mortality rates slightly, while cold spells led to a significant increase in deaths.[15][12] In addition, warmer weather decreases incidences of strokes, respiratory diseases, and the flu.[12]In general, life expectancies are higher in warmer climates, and there are fewer incidences of disease and other health problems. A warm period would be beneficial to human health. II.B. Economic BenefitsSome of the major industrial sectors, particularly agriculture, tend to work better in a warmer environment than they do in a cooler environment. 'The book [The Impact of Climate Change] finds that a moderate warming will have a positive economic impact on the agriculture and forestry sectors. Since carbon dioxide is used by plants to capture and store energy, there may be a fertilizing effect as levels of the gas rise. This, combined with longer growing seasons, fewer frosts and more precipitation, among other factors, could benefit some economic sectors.'[16][17]CO2 increases, a byproduct of temperature increases ([12]), naturally help to stimulate plant growth as well, further helping agriculture. 'For a 300 ppm increase in the atmosphere's CO2 concentration above the planet's current base level of slightly less than 400 ppm, for example, the productivity of earth's herbaceous plants rises by something on the order of 30%, while the productivity of its woody plants rises by something on the order of 50%.'[18][21]This further helps humans by increasing food yields, lowering rates of starvation and hunger. Conclusion There should be an insignificant change in the climate over the next couple of centuries as the sun continues its cycles and the Earth is in a moderately warm period. In the short term, the major factors in the climate show a decrease in temperature, but the long term shows a stabilization of temperatures to a reasonably warm level. This increases humans' life expectancies and increases crop yields, reducing the incidence of hunger, thereby further aiding in the increases in life expectancies. There is no rational reason to worry about the climate going off the deep end in the near future. On the contrary, our current climatic state seems to be helping us.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank Citrakayah for this great debate. I. Natural Factors Point to Little or No Change in Climate I.A. The Sun  My opponent claims that solar activity has diverged from temperatures since the 1980s. He, however, is making an incorrect conclusion.  Between raw solar activity (solar irradiance) and temperature, temperature lags about 7.5-10 years behind solar irradiance because of the heat capacity of the oceans. A better representation of the sun/temperature correlation is the length of the solar cycle. 'This new parameter not only indicated a remarkably high correlation coefficient between solar activity and temperature (on the order of 0.95), but it also eliminated the problem of the 7-year lag encountered by Reid.'[1][2][3] When looking at all of how the sun affects the climate: 'For example, the authors of a paper by NASA's JPL remark '...has compared the minimum aa [index of geomagnetic activity] values with the Earth's surface temperature record and found a correlation of 0.95 between the two data sets starting in 1885. The solar irradiance [solar activity] proxy developed from the aa minima continues to track the Earth's surface temperature until the present.''[4][5] In other words, using the better formulation produces an almost perfect correlation between solar activity and temperature.  'If the Scafetta and West analysis used the uncontaminated satellite data since 1980, the results would show that the Sun has contributed at least 75% of the global warming of the last century.'[6][7] That is at least how much the sun has contributed to recent warming.  I.A.1 Solar Flux Predictions 'From all that, for Solheim’s predicted temperature decline of 0.9º C over the whole of Solar Cycle 24 to be achieved, the decline from mid-2013 will be 1.2º C on average over the then remaining twelve and a half years of the cycle. No doubt the cooling will be back-loaded, making the further decline predicted over Solar Cycle 25 relative to Solar Cycle 24 more readily achievable.'[8] Solar activity is expected to decline, and as a result of that, so is temperature. I.A.2. Cosmic Ray FluxCosmic rays cause cloud formation: 'Preliminary results show that these faux cosmic rays indeed have an effect on the atmosphere: When high energy protons stream in, production of nanometer-sized particles in the atmosphere increases by more than ten times.'[9]  More clouds causes global cooling: 'Cloud cover has decreased over the past 39 years globally, and temperatures have risen during that time. This global decrease in cloud cover alone could account for all surface warming observed since the 1970s.'[10]  The change in cloudiness corresponds to the change in climate: 'A scarcity of muons can be linked to elevated global temperatures by a reduction in low cloud cover and low cloudiness was indeed at a minimum around 1992-93.'[11][12]  Cosmic rays cause cloud formation which cools the planet. As solar activity decreases, cosmic ray penetration will increase, thereby increasing cloud formation and cooling the planet. I.A.3. Ocean Currents It is when we look at the oceans that we see a clearer pattern between solar activity and temperature. Because the oceans have an enormous heat storage capacity, it takes several years for a warming of the oceans to be transmitted to the surface (hence the 8 year lag in solar activity and air temperatures). Solar activity and ocean currents correlate directly.[13]  'Current research also shows that Earth's oceans are now beginning to cool. It is also now clear that temperatures over the last century correlate far better with cycles in oceans than they do with carbon dioxide; and, the temperature cycles in oceans are caused by cycles of the sun.'[14]  The oceans have already flipped into a cool cycle, as I mentioned, because of the decrease in solar activity. I.B. The 1500-Year Cycle  These are global events. Take, for example, the Medieval Warm Period. Various temperature estimates say that locations as far flung as Greenland, Africa, New Zealand, and South America reported temperatures 1-4 degrees C above their current temperatures. Not only is the Medieval Warming seen. A Vostok Glacier ice core revealed the 1500 year cycle over 400,000 years, and correlates with glacial movement all over the globe, and at the same time. The same goes with seabed data.[15]  Overall, 'Based on this, the Earth is about 150 years into a moderate Modern Warming that will last a few centuries longer. It will essentially restore the fine climate of the Medieval Climate Optimum.”[15] This cycle coincidences with the increase in temperature. II. Positive Effects of the Current Interglacial and Warm Period II.A. Health Benefits Actually, 'The only global study suggests that this is true internationally: by 2050, there will be almost 400,000 more heat-related deaths a year, and almost 1.8 million fewer cold-related deaths. Warmer temperatures will save 1.4 million lives each year. The number of saved lives will outweigh the increase in heat-related deaths until at least 2200.'[16]  Yes, while it is easier to make fire than an air conditioner, heat is, overall, better for the body than cold (to a point). People in the Middle East are healthier (when controlled, that is) than people in, say, Siberia. What my opponent cites is not an increase in deaths from warming per se, but in temperature variability: 'The claim that warming increases morbidity rates is a myth. This isn't the case, according to Dr. Robert Mendelsohn, an environmental economist from Yale University. Mendelsohn argues that heat-stress deaths are caused by temperature variability and not warming. Those deaths grow in number not as climates warm but as the variability in climate increases.'[17]  Overall, if temperatures rose 2.5 degrees Celsius, deaths in the United States from respiratory diseases such as pneumonia and influenza, diseases of the circulatory system and even infectious diseases would drop by about 40,000 per year. Warming might reduce medical costs by about $20 billion annually.[18][19] II.B. Economic Benefits Con­sequently, the more CO2 there is in the air, the better plants grow, as has been demonstrated in literally thousands of laboratory and field experiments. As a result, the amount of carbon gained per unit of water lost per unit leaf area —or water-use efficiency—increases dramatically as the air’s CO2 content rises; and this phenomenon has been well documented in CO2 enrichment experiments with agricultural crops. In addition, CO2 concentration increases make plants hardier against dangers such as UV radiation and soil salinity. And finally, health promoting substances found in various food crops and medicinal plants have been shown to benefit from rising atmospheric CO2.[20] (Other sources to studies in that link)  Overall, increased CO2 concentrations help plants a lot more than hurt them. Plants feed on CO2, and more of it should make plants better. Conclusion This is a version of next century’s climate forecast using the information I provided:  Built in cooling trend until at least 2024 Temperature Hadsst3 moving average anomaly 2035 - 0.15 Temperature Hadsst3 moving average anomaly 2100 – 0.5 General Conclusion – by 2100 all the 20th century temperature rise will have been reversed.[21][22]  The next few centuries should see temperatures go up slightly, albeit with fluctuations in between by the climate contributors I provided. Health effects should be positive as a slight warming and increased CO2 concentrations increase agricultural production and optimal plant temperature (corresponding to the slight increase in temperatures). Climate change is not an imminent danger.</t>

    <t>Right, last round my sources had a problem, but I’ve reposted them in the comments section.I thank my opponent for the fantastic debate, and may the best arguments win.C1: Public HealthFirst, I’d like to note that Pro hasn’t addressed my points about dengue fever or yellow fever.To argue that infections decrease in warming periods misses the fact that over the past century or so we’ve made significant strides in treatments for tropical diseases such as malaria, as well as in fighting mosquito outbreaks[cite]. My argument is that all things being equal, an increase in temperature results in an increase in the spread of mosquito-born diseases. The fact that malaria can survive outside of the tropics is rather incidental to whether or not it is more virulent in the tropics. Pro concludes that since malaria rates have decreased over time, and it has happened outside the tropics, malaria would not be affected by global warming.The problem with this is that malaria rates (and pretty much every other tropical disease rate) responds to whatever’s forcing it, just like climate. Keep your temperature steady and leave standing water everywhere and you get more malaria. Kill mosquitos and keep everything else constant and malaria rates drop.We know that malaria is more virulent in warmer areas[1]. Therefore, as the world warms, we either are faced with an increase in malaria cases or have to expand our public health infrastructure to prevent them from occurring in the first place. The first can result in an increase in deaths, the second would have to be very well planned to avoid all deaths and would still result in economic damages. Ergo, we can conclude that a warming world presents risk.As far as heat deaths, this data may be true for the UK and Germany, but it is not necessarily true universally. Many low-income areas are in hot areas rather than cold ones, so quite conceivably that could cause there to still be a net increase in fatalities.C2: Sea Level RiseI don’t argue for an apocalypse where the ocean rises twenty feet.First I’d like to note that Tuvalu has an average elevation of about six feet above sea level. The highest point is fifteen feet[2]. So it doesn’t necessarily take much to cause damage. Also, there are waves, and tides, so even if a given area would still be above average sea level, that doesn’t mean it won’t get water damage.Secondly, sea level rise isn’t going to be constant everywhere. This is due to a variety of factors, such as the gravitational pull of the Earth being slightly different in different locations, temperature variations, and tectonic plates[3].Unfortunately for Tuvalu, it sits in what is probably the most unfortunate location a bunch of low-level coral atolls could[4]. Sea level in Tuvalu rises about three times as fast as in other locations[5].About 2.8 inches could matter quite a bit for an island that’s about six feet above sea level when one accounts for the fact that for them it could quite possibly be more in the range of 8 inches.This same reasoning can be applied to other locations. Brazil is close to an area that has a higher sea level[6].As to Pro’s claim that sea level is falling, the only thing that his source says that supports that is that the level fell slightly in one specific area in Western Canada, by .5 mm. That is hardly a global sea level drop, and satellite data confirms that sea level is rising[7].C3: Ocean AcidificationThat same paper cited concedes that calcification would be adversely impacted. As calcifying organisms are an essential part of the food chain, this doesn’t do much to dismiss my claim that ocean acidification poses a risk.In relation to the claim that increased carbon dioxide could be beneficial to shells, experiments with increased concentrations of carbon dioxide in seawater where shells are growing refute that. Shell dissolution is far more affected than shell calcification[8], in any event.While it’s true that pH isn’t fixed in the ocean, that doesn’t mean that shifting the whole range of pH values downwards, towards the more acidic end of the scale, would necessarily be acceptable. If I’m adapted to survive climates of 10-20 degrees Celsius, and it shifts upwards two or three degrees, I’m experiencing significant environmental stress. Since a drop in pH of one (say, from four to three) is a tenfold increase, since pH is a logarithmic scale, the problem with pH is even bigger.C4: Cloud ForestsIt’s true that Lawton’s paper shows that deforestation is having a significant effect on the cloud forests. It would be a mistake, however, to conclude from this that global warming has no effect. Modeling has demonstrated that increases in carbon dioxide would indeed affect the cloud forests[9]. Obviously deforestation has an effect to, as does general land use, but it can’t be gathered from the fact that damage to the cloud forests is caused by multiple factors that global warming has no effect.It is true that precipitation, in some regions, increases due to global warming. And it’s true that worse droughts have happened in the past. However, I must ask my opponent: Would you prefer a severe drought that is less severe than a massive drought that caused widespread damage, or would you prefer no drought at all? As Pro’s own source points out, droughts that are accompanied by warmer temperatures impact the environment more.Furthermore, global warming alters air circulation patterns, causing the distribution of moisture to change[11]. Even if all else remains equal, certain parts are going to get drier and other parts will get wetter--which has the potential for negative consequences, as noted in my source. For instance, recent droughts in the Sahel are expected to increase in severity due to global warming.Conclusion:I’ve demonstrated that the evidence points towards global warming not being due to the Sun—while I haven’t demonstrated that humans caused global warming, I don’t really need to. Given that the equations that are the current scientific consensus about how to predict warming match up with real observations, we can reasonably conclude that they are correct.Meanwhile, I’ve shown that any economic or health benefits from a warming world would be far outweighed by the costs—ocean acidification, sea level rise, loss of cloud forests, increase in heat stroke deaths, and spread of several virulent diseases. </t>

    <t>I.A. The Sun:  Well, I have no argument with saying that the Sun is the main factor on climate. Without it we'd be freezing--below freezing, in fact. But that doesn't necessarily mean that it's the main factor causing climate change.  Since the Sun is, indeed, emitting less energy compared to what it used to, we're left with the question of why the globe is still warming (I'll get to his argument, the 1500 year cycle, later). The Sun's contribution to the temperature trend since the late 1980s is, actually, negative. Lockwood said in his 2008 paper 'Recent changes in solar outputs and the global mean surface temperature' that the best esitmate is -1.3% of the temperature rise, with uncertainty placing it in the range of -.7% to -1.9%[1]. Clearly the Sun can't be invoked to explain recent temperature rises, since it should be causing us to cool.  Further evidence that it isn't the Sun can be found in the fact that the equation where, to quote Lockwood: 'S is the solar input variation; V is the volcanic aerosal effect (quantified by the global mean atmospheric optical depth, AOD); ΔE is the anomaly of energy exchange between the deep ocean and the surface mixing layer (Willis et al. 2004), here quantified by the N3.4 ENSO index; L is a linear drift term to allow for anthropogenic grenhouse gas and aerosol emissions (and associated feedbacks); and kE, kV and kS are the appropriate weighting (sensitivity factors).'  In plain English, that means that the equation is the result of what we think we know about how climate works, and was derived basically by combining a bunch of factors (including how sensitive we think the climate is to carbon dioxide/greenhouse gases--this is important) and seeing how we think that'll affect the climate. And as we see from the below graphic, it's not a bad prediction.  Recently, the predicted values are actually too low, which basically means that if anything we're current underestimating climatic sensitivity, or have missed a factor influencing climate.[1] Observed is blue, predicted is red.  Now, it is theoretically possible that the equation could still be completely wrong, and it just happened to fit well. But I regard it as a very small possibility. Certainly claiming that it is just a coincidence strains credulity.   I.A.1. Solar Flux Predictions  Pro is mistaken: The solar irradiation we are receiving has been declining for significantly longer. In fact, it has been decreasing since the 1980s, and would have been decreasing from the 1960s if not for a much larger drop that lasted a very short period of time. I.A.2. Cosmic Ray Flux  Cosmic rays induce aerosols, of that I have no doubt. But that does not necessarily lead to an increase in cloud cover, at least not a noticeable increase. There are various barriers to forming a cloud if one is a cosmic ray[2]. Mathematical models, meanwhile, put cosmic ray flux at two orders of magnitude too small to cause the observed cloud cover variation[3].  I.A.3. Ocean Currents  Ocean currents can't heat themselves, though. They can only shift heat around. The ocean itself is heating I.B. The 1500-Year Cycle  The 1500 year cycle my opponent refers to is, rather than an example of the globe increasing in temperature, an example of a bipolar see-saw, with the amount of heat remaining relatively constant but flowing to different places. My video explains this in more detail; increases in the North are offset by decreases in the South[5]. In climatology, these are called Dansgaard-Oeschger events[6].  Redistribution of heat is radically different than an increase in heat. The term 'global warming' indicates that, rather than heat flowing, the entire planet is warming--this is based up by graphs of total heat content[4].   II. Positive Effects of the Current Interglacial and Warm Period  II.A. Health Effects  I would simply like to reiterate that extreme heat does not behave the same as extreme cold. The predicted increase in deaths due to heat wave is approximately four times larger than the decrease in deaths due to cold snap[7]. The reason is simple: Easier to make fire than an air-conditioner.  Similarly, there is an upper limit to heat adaptability: Beyond about 35 degrees humans will start to experience the effects of hyperthermia, since we won't be able to dissipate heat[8]. An increase in seven degrees would cause large areas to experience this heat stress. This is about as the most reasonable value for the predicted temperature increase[9].  II.B. Economic Benefits  Plants that have more carbon dioxide and are experiencing more growth because of it also need more water to sustain that growth[10]. They are also more vulnerable to pests[11], and plants such as wheat can become less nutritous[12]. </t>

    <t>A Note: My arguments, which I started constructing before my opponent posted his round, have been based on the assumption that global warming is happening. If my opponent wishes to dispute this, I’ll argue that in Round 3, and it may be my main thrust of that round.I’d like to begin by noting that this debate doesn’t really hinge that much on who, or what, is causing global warming. C1: Public Health Many disease-carrying organisms can live only in areas with specific temperatures. For example, dengue fever is spread by (primarily) the mosquito Aedes aegypti, and lower temperatures limit disease transmission—this is because freezing temperatures kill overwinter larvae and eggs, size is reduced in warmer regions (making them have to feed more frequently to develop their eggs), and shorter incupation period for the virus (dengue type-2 has a period of twelve days at 30 C, but only has a period of seven days at 32-35 C).[1] All of these mean that warming temperatures would cause a significant increase in disease transmission.Dengue fever has no vaccine against it, and can be dangerous to certain groups (for instance, young children).[2] As many people in the South are uninsured[3], and the fever would be expanding its range into the South, we can reasonably conclude that dengue fever would cause significant problems due to global warming. The same can be said of yellow fever[4].Heat waves also pose a danger. Despite the fact that cold snaps might be reduced in frequency, the evidence indicates it won’t make up for increased deaths due to heat waves[5]. In part this is because extreme heat behaves differently than extreme cold, because it is more difficult to adapt to extreme heat.C2: Sea Level Rise: Sea level rise could potentially be very dangerous. Aside from the fact that nations like Tuvalu are at risk of partially submerging[6], there is a general risk of hundreds of millions of people in the developing world being displaced by sea level rise[7]. C3: Oceanic Acidification:As carbon dioxide levels rise, the ocean will absorb carbon dioxide. This in turn will acidify the ocean, which will cause organisms that use calcium carbonate to build their shells to have problems doing so[8]. Sea stars also have severe impacts inflicted on them (a drop of pH of .2 to .4 causes only .1% of a species of temperature brittle star larva to survive), as would squid (including commercially important species)[9]. Aside from the harmful effects on sea life (since we aren’t only talking about humans here), this damages coral reefs, and coral reefs are a useful source of tourist-related revenue[10]. Ergo we can reasonably conclude that ocean acidification will harm the economy of some areas. C4: Cloud Forests: Mountains have climates that vary based on elevation. For instance, the bottom might be forest, and the top might be an icecap. Cloud forests follow this pattern; the temperature depends on elevation. Plant and animal species in cloud forests rely on specific temperatures and humidity levels. In fact, the cloud forests of Costa Rica and the Andes have been rising over time—as the climate warms, the preferable temperature area moves upwards, resulting in the preferable elevation moving upwards. As a result, species have to move upwards—plants, for example, will have to move an average of 2600 feet to remain in equilibrium with climate, and they’ll have to do that by 2100 (based on 2006 statistics). In the Monteverde cloud forest, this may be already happening. Dry seasons are longer (since the mid-1070s) and this has coincided with some local extinctions (a few amphibian species, for instance) </t>

    <t>I accept, and wish the best of luck to my opponent.</t>
<h>I'm new here as well, best of luck.  The Pro's opening argument consists of two basic ideas; that technology is advancing fast and that that it is beneficial to us. Now, I won't deny my usage of technology. I think everyone in industrialized countries in fact takes technology for granted at time. But I can't say I agree that technology advancement is necessarily for the better. In a world that has made so many technological developments in the past century alone, we can see that it's probably been more of a detriment to us than beneficial. I have 5 primary contentions to the Pro. I will label all of the arguments so you can address them easier.  1. Terrorism Harms Increase in weapons such as bombs, guns, and even using vehicles to kill people (whether it's cars or planes). I think this is a common argument and doesn't need much elaboration. In the next century we're bound to blow up the planet. Technology has shown to hurt our collaboration between countries, and terrorism is (sadly) a growing danger to people of the 'superpower' countries on our planet.  2. Social Media Impact Harms We become self-reliant on technology; things like social media have absolutely consumed young peoples' lives. I can't deny that when I don't have Internet for an extended period of time I feel beyond deprived. But after awhile, I realize I don't need it. I think technology hurts face-to-face communicative ability of our youth. I'll admit I like things like Facebook, but I don't let it affect my schooling. When I can seriously see people in an 8-hour day of school use their phone so much I can't believe it. They text, IM, they use social media, they take pictures, they don't focus on the material being taught at that moment in class, they act inappropriately if they get their phones taken away. Technology hurts our youth far too much.  3. Social Media Harms - Extension (thought this little portion needed it's own section) There is further concern when people can go as far as to RUINING someone's life on the Internet. People are much more hurtful in modern times..  4. Human Extinction Harm Population increase is shown to be a big problem, we're expected to surpass our carrying capacity within the next century, and quite frankly we don't have a good solution for that. When technology has helped with the developments of medicine by preventing death and increasing life spans its made for a big problem on Earth. The increase in technology can go as far as put us through extinction! If that doesn't shoot down your belief that technological growth (especially at this rate) is good... I'm not sure what will!  5. Animal Extinction/Habitat Destruction My final argument is going to simply be showing the effects on other life on Earth. Many species have faced extinction because of man, we do things like deforestation that destroys their habitat, polluting oceans. I don't want to extend on this too much to be quite honest.  By reflecting on what has been said by both sides so far; I agree that progress can help out in life.. I don't think technological growth is beneficial to our planet, to other species on this planet, and furthermore.. to us.</h>

<h>Sorry for the late post.  Well, this is my last round, and I will have no more to say after you post your final argument. It was a pleasure debating with you thus far and you have provided some formidable cases to me. I will invite you to another debate that I am planning to create soon, probably the effects of a free market on a population.  A point I want to make is that while one animal is going extinct, scientists are figuring out ways to bring back two animals. The idea is that while forests are being cut down, some are being preserved and much more action is being taken to relive those forests' once glory. Or, while some unlucky few are being embarrassed online, many more others are gaining a large benefit for the same reason. Think of how education has changed - even if youth are slightly more inclined to desire to be occupied with a phone, the class parts that they pay attention to are growing exponentially in terms of effectiveness. With the arrival of iPads, SmartBoards, and other multimedia presentation technologies, students are able to learn what was a week's worth of knowledge in the 20th century in a single day today.  Technology is also a new frontier in careers. Not to forget the availability of applications and online work jobs that are improving people's lives, but there are thousands of new prospects for those with a talent in technology. These jobs pay well, and they wouldn't be here without this recent Industrial Revolution. That's another benefit that technology bestows upon us.  Now think of factories. Without an assembly line, robotic arms, or the easy transport of goods, the huge industrial booms of the 20th century could not have been possible. Cars would be more expensive and less frequently used if not for the technological advances that gave people robotic arms, assembly lines, and easy transportation. Cars, specifically, are a perfect example of the way technology has been affecting our lives. At first, production explodes and the environment is taking a big hit, but eventually cars are getting more and more efficient. Now, as technology is really growing fast, cars that run on cleaner sources or cars that run for twice or thrice as long are being sold. People saw that they were hurting the environment and were a quickly growing problem. Now guess what? 'SmartCars' and bicycles are the new preference, and some completely electric automobiles are on the way. It goes to show that while almost every aspect of technology's advance can yield harsh costs, if applied directly, these drawbacks can be reduced to minor issues that aren't important.  On the topic of climate change and the extinction of animals, there has been action diverted to this issue as well. Many new organizations and parks are being created for the preservation of nature, and for the life of animals. In my previous statement, I didn't mean to say that animals were unimportant, but that the people who can choose to collect some money and destroy an acre of forest or do nothing would prefer to rake in the cash. However, people who live like that are quickly being thrown out of their position.  Now on to your statements about terrorism and such, specifically. If we simply cannot come to an agreement with terrorist groups to leave each other alone (which could be made easier by technology, by the way), then the least we can do is use the very same technology breakthroughs to arm ourselves well from any attack they hold on us. Honestly, though, I doubt that if we remove ALL our troops from their country, make up for our troubles with some support for their people, and completely be isolated from those areas, that they will still burn with desire to bomb us. If anyone in power had the idea to try that out and focus on more important internal issues such as climate change or homelessness, well who knows things would change.  With human extinction problems, the current answer has been to build up. That works, really, and it makes for beautiful developed cities, but there is still overpopulation in India and China! Why is this? If you know the geographic phrase 'The rich get richer and the poor have more kids', then you may be familiar with this. Poor families need more children to do more survival farming, but they are still not able to feed them more than the bare minimum, and those kids each have their own children, and it grows extremely quickly. If, say, a more developed government was there to help its citizens instead of dictating the country, this issue wouldn't be happening. In addition, even if this problem would still exist with a helpful government, large apartment buildings or multi-houses can be build with new technologies and help to reduce the overcrowding population in places such as India or China.  The final statement that I want to make clear:  Whatever harms technology will bring due to man's unjust intentions can be reversed and sent flying in the opposite direction as long as attention is brought to the problem. This example is shown well with the evolution of commercial automobiles and the cutting down (and rebuilding) of forestry around the world.</h>

    <t>I'll cover all of the standing arguments in this speech; in order.  1. Terrorism - You recognize yourself that there is an increase in terrorism which can be directly correlated with technological development. The problem with this is that we can't come to an agreement with other countries, above all else, it's empirically proven that technology separates us from other parts of the world. Countries that view things differently from one another (i.e. The United States and the majority of corrupt Middle Eastern countries) won't have any reason to make agreements with us. It's a bit outrageous to think we can actually make some countries come to full agreements with us (as much as you and I both would like to see). The biggest point here is simply... with the increase of technology we see ourselves getting further away from other countries, it's a sad reality. -You're absolutely correct, technology does come with a cost. We both agree with this statement. Unfortunately, the cost is too much to handle, as I'm stressing in all of my arguments in this debate.  2. Social Media -I think that the fact they use it in school was more of an example and you shouldn't disregard the other points I brought up. I don't care to argue whether or not they would read a book if they didn't have a phone (which I think would still be better..) The argument I have here.. the one I want to stress is that it consumes our lives everywhere. Not just in school. Just for further clarification, people will stop communicating at a dinner table. I come from a family where we can't have our phones out at dinner time, I talk about my day and I find interest in mundane things about my family members' days. I go to a good friend's house and they all (parents included) text on their phones. They don't bother to ask about their day. This might be pure speculation, but it's odd that I have people skills and can show emotions better than my friend. I think there's a strong line of correlation that displays people who use technology less are more personable. There will be exceptions of course, I'm sure. I mean, even our writing/spelling/grammar skills are hurt. Shorthand on the things you write and the proper spelling of things. It hurts me to see people in my high school class not know how to spell things I vividly remember learning in... 2nd grade.  3. Social Media/Bullying I actually planned on kicking this argument after my initial post, but your response has actually made me want to continue it. You're absolutely right on everything you say, but there are so many cases (recent) where it doesn't matter. This is just one example, take into consideration there are a lot of other similar stories, but I can recall a few years back I heard about a college student who was *doing his man stuff*, and a group of students must have recorded him somehow, they posted that video of him on multiple sites and he went on to kill himself. No 'Terms of Service' and deactivation of an account can automatically stop you from becoming a meme and living a life of embarrassment. I don't think that this argument is NEARLY as important as my others, but it is a good example of showing how Internet can have negative impacts.  4. Human Extinction I agree that we are doing our best to make sure our carrying capacity is increased. But even if that's true, we're only increasing our maximum capacity at a slow rate, in the mean time we continue to do things like pollute the air and destroy the ozone (with technology, mind you). And I don't mean to be disrespectful to scientists, but come on.. we haven't made any progress in the last 30 years as far as space exploration with man made missions. When it's too late, it will be too late. Where are we honestly going to go? Sure we've talked about the Moon and Mars, but there isn't any underlying evidence that shows we'll be able to support colonies of people on other celestial bodies.  5. Animal Extinction -This has got to irritate me the most, that you really think it's okay for us to put so many groups of animals in endangerment and push it further to extinction. When you say that 'if it wasn't worth it to people, it wouldn't be happening' you sound so ignorant. Aside from being able to witness the beauty of animals in their natural habitat and the beauty of nature, that isn't going to my focus as I near the end of my argument. -The animals and plants we lose, are the important ones.. I'm going to take this from a study from Drew Harvell a professor at Cornell University that basically says, 'the ones that help us fight disease are the ones that are being killed by human carelessness, and the species that do survive are the ones that pass on things like lyme disease and west nile.' -For example, when forests are fragmented, opossum numbers decline and white-footed mice thrive. Opossums serve as buffers for Lyme disease because they absorb and kill some of the ticks that carry the disease; at the same time, mice amplify both the numbers of ticks and the Lyme disease pathogen. Scientists do not know why the most resilient species, such as mice, are the ones that also amplify pathogens.  6. I don't mean to throw a new argument your way at this point, but I do want to point out that climate change can be linked to my 4th and 5th arguments. Climate Change is a real issue that we're not compensating for with our so to speak 'green policies' where we try and help the environment. The fact is, we deteriorate the ozone layer more than we compensate for it with what we try and do.  You're right; that probably is very true explanation and definition of what technology is, we create it so it makes life easier, and to help with our desires. That doesn't mean our desires are good, man is selfish and we are willing to do things like kill animals, and destroy the environment, and be completely reckless with it. A lot of your arguments are kind of around this principle of 'technology isn't bad, people are the ones doing the bad things' but I just want to highlight that your topic of discussion here is technological advancements are good and they can't be good when we see all 6 of the things I've pointed out. Technology obviously can't be bad, since it's an inanimate object... but it's creation is what separates man on many levels.</t>

    <t>Thank you for accepting.  It is true that technology can be used in harmful ways, one of them being increased terrorism. However, the real problem lies in the actions the US and other countries do to 'provoke' terrorist peoples to use technology against us. Although they wouldn't be such a threat without such abilities, the more important thing is to make an agreement with them and make the best out of technology. As they say, there is no free lunch, so the arrival of new weapons is going to come with a cost, but not one that overwhelms the benefits.  The effect of TV, email, and text messages is that youth who participate with these inventions are becoming much more connected and, yes, occupied. While a student may use a phone in school, the issue is the boredom of the scholar and the barely enforced rule of 'no phones allowed' or whatever. If they didn't have this technology, then they would be sneaking a book underneath their desk, and their attention would still be diverted.  The Internet can be a vile place. However, it comes with a 'Terms of Service' that is automatically accepted every time you open a browser. What it states is that - Whatever you participate in, whether it be Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, or others, you are responsible for your words and others can say or do anything they want. If you don't like their comments, it is your utmost responsibility to delete your account, or you are wandering back into flame war territory. If you don't like the Internet, or what people will do there, don't use it. In addition, I am almost sure most people would prefer getting insulted online than getting cornered and pounded by the very same bully.  This is a challenging area to talk about because what people WANT to do is help all others live longer, but they KNOW the population is increasing at an unsafe rate and increased life expectancy is a major cause of this problem. However, technology is not only for healing the sick or prolonging the lives of the old, it can be applied to eliminating the side effects of overpopulation. As the world's population skyrockets, so does space exploration technology. If massive crowds of people at every corner on this planet turns into such a problem, then we know that scientists will get their butts in gear to send people off to another habitable planet. In the end, what you are doing is helping more people live longer without causing too much trouble with the population. With a drawback, technology brings a better bonus.  It is quite sad that animals are dying out and forests are being eliminated as we speak, but if it wasn't worth it to people, it wouldn't be happening. Technology, like a market, fits to whatever people want or need best. If people don't care about a forest, then they will cut it down, even if they know of the harm to the animal species that once lived there.  Overall, technology helps people achieve what they want, so it reflects mankind's desires. This may be the survival of its kind, the ability to communicate more easily, or to clear out land for farming or other uses. Regardless of what it is, it is not the fault of new technology that these bad situations are popping up, it is man's own fault, and his decisions are what need to change.</t>

    <t>I'm new here as well, best of luck.  The Pro's opening argument consists of two basic ideas; that technology is advancing fast and that that it is beneficial to us. Now, I won't deny my usage of technology. I think everyone in industrialized countries in fact takes technology for granted at time. But I can't say I agree that technology advancement is necessarily for the better. In a world that has made so many technological developments in the past century alone, we can see that it's probably been more of a detriment to us than beneficial. I have 5 primary contentions to the Pro. I will label all of the arguments so you can address them easier.  1. Terrorism Harms Increase in weapons such as bombs, guns, and even using vehicles to kill people (whether it's cars or planes). I think this is a common argument and doesn't need much elaboration. In the next century we're bound to blow up the planet. Technology has shown to hurt our collaboration between countries, and terrorism is (sadly) a growing danger to people of the 'superpower' countries on our planet.  2. Social Media Impact Harms We become self-reliant on technology; things like social media have absolutely consumed young peoples' lives. I can't deny that when I don't have Internet for an extended period of time I feel beyond deprived. But after awhile, I realize I don't need it. I think technology hurts face-to-face communicative ability of our youth. I'll admit I like things like Facebook, but I don't let it affect my schooling. When I can seriously see people in an 8-hour day of school use their phone so much I can't believe it. They text, IM, they use social media, they take pictures, they don't focus on the material being taught at that moment in class, they act inappropriately if they get their phones taken away. Technology hurts our youth far too much.  3. Social Media Harms - Extension (thought this little portion needed it's own section) There is further concern when people can go as far as to RUINING someone's life on the Internet. People are much more hurtful in modern times..  4. Human Extinction Harm Population increase is shown to be a big problem, we're expected to surpass our carrying capacity within the next century, and quite frankly we don't have a good solution for that. When technology has helped with the developments of medicine by preventing death and increasing life spans its made for a big problem on Earth. The increase in technology can go as far as put us through extinction! If that doesn't shoot down your belief that technological growth (especially at this rate) is good... I'm not sure what will!  5. Animal Extinction/Habitat Destruction My final argument is going to simply be showing the effects on other life on Earth. Many species have faced extinction because of man, we do things like deforestation that destroys their habitat, polluting oceans. I don't want to extend on this too much to be quite honest.  By reflecting on what has been said by both sides so far; I agree that progress can help out in life.. I don't think technological growth is beneficial to our planet, to other species on this planet, and furthermore.. to us.</t>

    <t>Sorry for the late post.  Well, this is my last round, and I will have no more to say after you post your final argument. It was a pleasure debating with you thus far and you have provided some formidable cases to me. I will invite you to another debate that I am planning to create soon, probably the effects of a free market on a population.  A point I want to make is that while one animal is going extinct, scientists are figuring out ways to bring back two animals. The idea is that while forests are being cut down, some are being preserved and much more action is being taken to relive those forests' once glory. Or, while some unlucky few are being embarrassed online, many more others are gaining a large benefit for the same reason. Think of how education has changed - even if youth are slightly more inclined to desire to be occupied with a phone, the class parts that they pay attention to are growing exponentially in terms of effectiveness. With the arrival of iPads, SmartBoards, and other multimedia presentation technologies, students are able to learn what was a week's worth of knowledge in the 20th century in a single day today.  Technology is also a new frontier in careers. Not to forget the availability of applications and online work jobs that are improving people's lives, but there are thousands of new prospects for those with a talent in technology. These jobs pay well, and they wouldn't be here without this recent Industrial Revolution. That's another benefit that technology bestows upon us.  Now think of factories. Without an assembly line, robotic arms, or the easy transport of goods, the huge industrial booms of the 20th century could not have been possible. Cars would be more expensive and less frequently used if not for the technological advances that gave people robotic arms, assembly lines, and easy transportation. Cars, specifically, are a perfect example of the way technology has been affecting our lives. At first, production explodes and the environment is taking a big hit, but eventually cars are getting more and more efficient. Now, as technology is really growing fast, cars that run on cleaner sources or cars that run for twice or thrice as long are being sold. People saw that they were hurting the environment and were a quickly growing problem. Now guess what? 'SmartCars' and bicycles are the new preference, and some completely electric automobiles are on the way. It goes to show that while almost every aspect of technology's advance can yield harsh costs, if applied directly, these drawbacks can be reduced to minor issues that aren't important.  On the topic of climate change and the extinction of animals, there has been action diverted to this issue as well. Many new organizations and parks are being created for the preservation of nature, and for the life of animals. In my previous statement, I didn't mean to say that animals were unimportant, but that the people who can choose to collect some money and destroy an acre of forest or do nothing would prefer to rake in the cash. However, people who live like that are quickly being thrown out of their position.  Now on to your statements about terrorism and such, specifically. If we simply cannot come to an agreement with terrorist groups to leave each other alone (which could be made easier by technology, by the way), then the least we can do is use the very same technology breakthroughs to arm ourselves well from any attack they hold on us. Honestly, though, I doubt that if we remove ALL our troops from their country, make up for our troubles with some support for their people, and completely be isolated from those areas, that they will still burn with desire to bomb us. If anyone in power had the idea to try that out and focus on more important internal issues such as climate change or homelessness, well who knows things would change.  With human extinction problems, the current answer has been to build up. That works, really, and it makes for beautiful developed cities, but there is still overpopulation in India and China! Why is this? If you know the geographic phrase 'The rich get richer and the poor have more kids', then you may be familiar with this. Poor families need more children to do more survival farming, but they are still not able to feed them more than the bare minimum, and those kids each have their own children, and it grows extremely quickly. If, say, a more developed government was there to help its citizens instead of dictating the country, this issue wouldn't be happening. In addition, even if this problem would still exist with a helpful government, large apartment buildings or multi-houses can be build with new technologies and help to reduce the overcrowding population in places such as India or China.  The final statement that I want to make clear:  Whatever harms technology will bring due to man's unjust intentions can be reversed and sent flying in the opposite direction as long as attention is brought to the problem. This example is shown well with the evolution of commercial automobiles and the cutting down (and rebuilding) of forestry around the world.</t>

    <t>debate: technolog I gave an example of one animal, great for scientists who are figuring out ways to return animals. But we're not losing just one animal, we're losing tons of animals at a fast rate. This contention alone should win me the entire debate. Same thing with the forest argument. I feel like if you pull across all of my previous arguments from the previous two speeches you should be able to see my point that while things may or may not be preserved.. we are still losing things at a greater rate than we are keeping them.  I agree that education has changed for the better, that isn't my argument. My argument is that kids are more ineffective not only in classrooms, but in everyday life. Communication has been hindered greatly. Yes it is a new frontier in jobs, a new frontier does not mean we benefit from it more than before. We still had jobs and careers before technological expansion.  clean cars are a great thing, they impact the environment a lot less.. I'm aware, but right now in an economy that's not at it's best in the United States.. we can't afford these cars. Almost everyone I know (living in the Midwestern part of the states) can't really afford clean cars.. green cars for example are extremely expensive and there is almost no one who can afford it.  There is still little being about the issue of extinction.. steps take place, but just looking from a real-world perspective we see that so much of the earth is in demise whether it be: Animals who are important to our survival, forests, depletion of the ozone. I've really stressed this in the debate. I think I should win on those arguments if nothing else. Not to mention we're at risk of our own extinction because of these things.  And I don't even want to really discuss terrorism, I think it's implied that carelessness and lack of cooperation has continued (otherwise we wouldn't be so heavily targeted)  ANYONE VOTING ON THIS.. VOTE ON THIS FINAL POINT I WANT TO BRING ACROSS: -Your arguments look like this throughout the entire debate; 'Yes technology does some bad, but it also does good.' I'm saying, 'we were fine before technology because we didn't create bad things.. and the good things are not a necessity for living.' A lot of his arguments (and I pointed this out in the last speech) go around the premise that we need to better learn to manage the way we use technology. Empirically speaking, we aren't willing to learn to manage it in an effective and safe way.  Please vote for the con based on my arguments from all 3 speeches.</t>

    <t>Wake up, Rip Van Winkel</t>
<h>I would like to thank Magic8000 for accepting this debate. I. The Universe and Global WarmingThe current state of the Galaxy and our Sun is affecting our temperatures.I.i. The Rest of the Solar SystemThe Sun clearly is in a warmer phase, because all of the other planets have increasing temperatures as well. 'In 2005 data from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor and Odyssey missions revealed that the carbon dioxide 'ice caps' near Mars's south pole had been diminishing for three summers in a row.Habibullo Abdussamatov, head of space research at St. Petersburg's Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory in Russia, says the Mars data is evidence that the current global warming on Earth is being caused by changes in the sun.'[1]''Global warming on Neptune's moon Triton as well as Jupiter and Pluto, and now Mars has some [scientists] scratching their heads over what could possibly be in common with the warming of all these planets … Could there be something in common with all the planets in our solar system that might cause them all to warm at the same time?''[2] Two things can be drawn from this. One, that if other planets are warming, that it is only natural for the Earth to be warming as well. And second, that even if all these planets did have natural causes, then that is a sign of Earth's natural climatic change, instead of man-made. I.ii. The Position of the Milky Way GalaxyEvery approximately 135 million years, Earth enters a more populated area of the Milky Way, and as a result, more cosmic rays hit the Earth, which causes cooling. Currently, we are in a less populated area of the Milky Way, which means that less of these cosmic rays will be hitting the Earth, which means less cloud formation, and of course, warming. [3] for the source on this hypothesis. The sun can also cause this through evaporation.II. Earthly CausesThere are many internal causes of Global Warming as well. II.i. Ocean Current Anomalies Ocean temperature anomalies seem to be rising-along with the temperature. '...one can model past temperatures as a linear trend (that started well before CO2 was added in any substantial quantity) and periodic bumps... ...temperatures over the last 100+ years look a lot like a linear trend plus ocean cycle-driven bumps'[4] What is causing all the bumps?: [4]As shown in the graph, the PDO, or ocean currents, temperature has affected the average Earth's temperature.    II.ii. Clouds: A Continuation of Point I.ii.I mentioned about the position of the Milky Way Galaxy and the Sun in regards to these 'cosmic rays'. Here is a more in depth look at the effects of position. 'The implications, if true, had potentially enormous implications for the debate about natural causes of warming. When the sun is very active, it can be thought of as pushing away cosmic rays from the Earth, reducing their incidence. When the sun is less active, we see more cosmic rays. This is fairly well understood. But if Svensmark was correct, it would mean that periods of high solar output should coincide with reduced cloud formation (due to reduced cosmic race incidence), which in turn would have a warming effect on the Earth, since less sunlight would be reflected back into space before hitting the Earth.Here was a theory, then, that would increase the theoretical impact on climate of an active sun, and better explain why solar irradiance changes might be underestimating the effect of solar output changes on climate and temperatures.'[4]'Since he first suggested his hypothesis over a decade and a half ago, Svensmark and other researchers have slowly been putting together research to test it.' The results were: 'Scientists found that when shielding was removed and natural cosmic rays allowed to hit the chamber, cloud seeding increased dramatically, and it increased substantially again when additional artificial cosmic rays were added. Svensmark appears to have gotten it right.'[5] Proof here is in the next points. III. The 1500-Year Cycle This has to do with a cycle of the climate that can explain the warming. 'Through at least the last million years, a moderate 1500-year warm-cold cycle has been superimposed over the longer, stronger Ice Ages and warm interglacials.'[6]  Here is a graph related to this:  [7]There are two things we can conclude from this graph. First, that up-and-down cycles are normal for the long-term climate. This century's global warming is nothing new. The second thing we can conclude, is that today's global warming is not as bad as the Medieval Warm Period's peak yet, and the Medieval Warm Period was less than the Holocene Maximum Period.    'Even more important, the earth is not 'the warmest it has ever been.' In fact, the earth was much warmer during the Medieval Warm Period when human agriculture flourished!'[7]'The scientists found evidence that on average, every 1,470 years, plus or minus 500 years, cold, ice-bearing waters, which today circulate around southern Greenland, pushed as far south as Great Britain.'[8] There seems to be a full cycle of up-down-up temperatures of the climate every 1470 years. And this goes as far back as at least 1 million years ago. Currently, we are in an upswing of temperatures, just coming off of the Little Ice Age, the peak to be in a few hundred years, making the peak-to-peak difference between today's global warming and the Medieval Warm Period a little less than 1500 years. So today's Global Warming is a natural, cyclical occurence.    IV. The Sun: The Proof of Theories I.ii and II.iiThe sun's cycles have a lot to do with temperatures also.  'In this chamber, 63 CERN scientists from 17 European and American institutes have done what global warming doomsayers said could never be done — demonstrate that cosmic rays promote the formation of molecules that in Earth’s atmosphere can grow and seed clouds, the cloudier and thus cooler it will be. Because the sun’s magnetic field controls how many cosmic rays reach Earth’s atmosphere (the stronger the sun’s magnetic field, the more it shields Earth from incoming cosmic rays from space), the sun determines the temperature on Earth.'[9]'Svensmark matched the data on cosmic rays from the neutron monitor in Climax, Colorado, with the satellite measurements of solar irradiance from 1970 to 1990. Over the period between 1975 and 1989, he found cosmic rays decreased by 1.2 percent annually, amplifying the sun's change in irradiance about four-fold'[6]So, as the sun's activity increases, so does the temperature. This below graph shows the correlation:   [10]This graph clearly shows that temperature goes up and down with solar activity, because an increase in solar activity directly correlates with an increase in average temperature 1-2 years later. And as a final side note, I would like to present this graph that helps disprove the anthropogenic cause theory, regarding again, ocean temperature anomalies:     [4]So 'nature' created the same temperature trend as 'humans' did.</h>

    <t>Global warming causes climate change</t>
<h>To save on space I will summerize my opponents arguments1. The sun is warming since other planets are warming.2. The sun via cosmic rays are causing global warming.3. Oceans are causing global warming.4. We’re going though a 1500-Year Cycle4a. The Medieval Warm Period5. Temperature of 1895-1946 vs 1957-20081. The sun is warming since other planets are warming.The sun isn’t warming at all, in fact it’s cooling. A study by Usoskin in 2005 debunks the claim that the Earth is warming due to a warming sun. He writes '...during these last 30 years the solar total irradiance, solar UV irradiance and cosmic ray flux has not shown any significant secular trend, so that at least this most recent warming episode must have another source.' [1]In fact, the sun has been contributing to some cooling in the past few decades. [2]Other studies have also debunked the claimA study by Erlykin says“We deduce that the maximum recent increase in the mean surface temperature of the Earth which can be ascribed to solar activity is 14% of the observed global warming.' [3]'Although solar and volcanic effects appear to dominate most of the slow climate variations within the past thousand years, the impacts of greenhouse gases have dominated since the second half of the last century.' -Ammann [4]'The variations measured from spacecraft since 1978 are too small to have contributed appreciably to accelerated global warming over the past 30 years.'- Foukal [5]So what about the other planets? First off Con commits the fallacy of composition, his reasoning is “if 1 planet is warming naturally all planets are warming naturally”. You must agree other planets are very different from Earth.Mars: Observations show Mars is experiancing short term regional warming, but not long term global warming. [6]Pluto: MIT scientists explain “Pluto’s orbit is much more elliptical than that of the other planets, and its rotational axis is tipped by a large angle relative to its orbit. Both factors could contribute to drastic seasonal changes.” [7]Jupiter: Global warming isn’t happening on Jupiter, it’s predicted. It's said to warm not because of the sun, but because “the loss of these atmospheric whirlpools, the average temperature on Jupiter will change by as much as 10 degrees Celsius, getting warmer near the equator and cooler at the poles,' [8]Neptune: Neptune is warming. Its orbit is 164 years, our observations are less than a third of Neptune's year. The climate modeling of Neptune says Neptune is undergoing a seasonal change into summer. [9]This also would cause Triton's atmosphere to become thinner, causing warming. [10]2. The sun via cosmic rays are causing global warming.Looking at the data disproves this hypothesis. While cosmic rays are high the temperature is also high.Annual average GCR counts per minute (blue - note that numbers decrease going up the left vertical axis, because lower GCRs should mean higher temperatures) vs. annual average global surface temperature (red, right vertical axis)From NOAA [11], The Neutron Monitor Database [12], and Skeptical Science [13]'between 1970 and 1985 the cosmic ray flux, although still behaving similarly to the temperature, in fact lags it and cannot be the cause of its rise. Thus changes in the cosmic ray flux cannot be responsible for more than 15% of the temperature increase'- Krivova [14]'galactic cosmic rays appear to play a minor role for atmospheric aerosol formation events, and so for the connected aerosol-climate effects as well.'- Kulmalahttp://www.atmos-chem-phys.net...Correlations between low clouds and cosmic rays broke in 1991, then cloud cover began to lag cosmic rays by 6 months [15] ,even though cloud formation should happen within a few days [16]Svensmark said the loss of correlation was because of long term calibration drift in ISCCP satellites, but the ISCCP themselves disagreehttp://www.realclimate.org...Sloan and Wolfendale pointed out Chernobyl disaster should've produced increased cloud cover according to this hypothesis, but there was nonehttp://arxiv.org...'In this chamber, 63 CERN scientists from 17 European and American institutes have done what global warming doomsayers said could never be done — demonstrate that cosmic rays promote the formation of molecules that in Earth’s atmosphere can grow and seed clouds,”This was based off a false understanding of the CERN paperSee the first video.3. Oceans are causing global warming.The oceans would cool when its heat goes to the atmosphere. Observations show oceans are warming [17]. The oceans are actually good evidence for the resolution.'the observed ocean heat-content changes are consistent with those expected from anthropogenic forcing, which broadens the basis for claims that an anthropogenic signal has been detected in the global climate system.' [18]4. 1500-Year CycleCon makes another category error here. There’s defiantly a 1500 year climate cycle. We know that from ice core data from Greenland -as Con cited-, but these events known as the “Dansgaard-Oeschger events” don’t increase the global temperature. It’s only a temperature shift or a see-saw temperature change in the 2 hemispheres. [19]Also see the second video.4a. The Medieval Warm PeriodCon cites the Medieval Warm Period to try and prove his claim about the 1500 year cycle. However there’s no evidence that shows the MWP was as warm globally as it is today.NOAA says“In summary, it appears that the late 20th and early 21st centuries are likely the warmest period the Earth has seen in at least 1200 years.” [20]and“The idea of a global or hemispheric 'Medieval Warm Period' that was warmer than today however, has turned out to be incorrect.” [21]Here’s the differences5. Temperature of 1895-1946 vs 1957-2008At the very end Con posts a chart of the temperature of 1895-1946 and 1957-2008. Both are very similar and seem to prove climate change is by nature. Based on data from Hadlet, GISS, NOAA, NCEP R1, NCEP TCR, ERA-40, and AMTI, Skeptical Science formed these 2 charts around those time periods. It’s close enough to see the claim is wrong[22]Back to ConSources in link below[1] </h>

    <t>I would like to thank Magic8000 for this great debate. I. The Sun Is Warming Since the Other Planets Are WarmingI admit, the sun is cooling currently, but the correlation between the sun and the climate is reinforced by this by my earlier proof that the Earth's temperature is stabilizing, and thus beginning to cool.The sun is warmer now than at any time in the last 11500 years.[1] 'Moreover, changes in the heliospheric magnetic field have been linked with changes in total cloud cover over the Earth, which may influence global climate change. Here we report that the measurements of the near-Earth interplanetary magnetic field reveal that the total magnetic field leaving the sun has risen by a factor 1.4 since 1964.'[2][3]This can be seen in this graph:    [3]Recently, the sun has cooled compared to recent times. But one, climate lags behind solar activity, and two, this is being seen in the recent temperature slowdown. '... the Sun is now changing from its Solar Grand Maximum to its Solar Grand Minimum. The Earth heats up after a Solar Grand Maximum, lagging a bit after the peak. With a Solar Grand Minimum now on its way, a 'global cooling' may be on the horizon--a natural oscillation occurring in much longer solar cycles.'[4]Changes in the Sun can account for major climate changes on Earth for the past 300 years, including part of the recent surge of global warming, 300 years, including part of the recent surge of global warming.[5]This can also be seen in climate data:    [6]. Longer term, here is a correlation of a solar proxy to a temperature proxy for a period of 3000 years. Values of carbon-14 (produced by cosmic rays, hence a proxy for solar activity) correlate extremely well with oxygen-18 (temperature proxy).  The lower graph shows a particularly well-resolved time interval from 8,350 to 7,900 years BP.  The above graph summarizes data obtained from a stalagmite from a cave in Oman.Finally, we see the correlation between temperature and CO2 amp; solar activity:   [7]. It's easy to see the sun is more determinent.   On the planets, here are some solar system wide effects:  Sun - 'Recent Activity Highest in 8000 Years [meaning it's not just the 11-year cycle] and magnetic field has decreased in size by 25% 300% increase in galactic dust entering solar system Mercury - magnetosphere experiencing significant increases Venus  - 2500% Increase in Green Glow Mars - Rapid Appearance of Clouds, Ozone and'Up to 50% Erosion of Ice Features in one year alone Jupiter - Plasma Torus increasing and'Jupiter's Disappearance of White Ovals since 1997 ' recent increase in storms Io - 'observing same changes -' 200% Increase in Density of Plasma Torus and Ionosphere 1000% Higher Europa - Much Brighter Than Expected Ganymede - 200% brighter Saturn's - Plasma Torus 1000% Denser and'Aurora First Seen in polar regions in recent years Uranus - featureless in 1996, now exhibiting huge storms since 1999 and markedly brighter in 2004 than in 1999 Neptune - 40% Brighter, Near Infrared Range ' 1996 ' 2002 Triton - Severe atmospheric changes, warming Pluto - 300% increase in atmospheric pressure.  [8]. You can't be telling me all of this is a coincidence. Also, on Pluto, it is moving further away from the sun despite the fact it is warming.II. The Sun Via Cosmic Rays Is Causing Global Warming    Looking at the Earth's long climatic history, it is easy to see the correlation:[9]      [10]Low clouds means warmer temperatures: 'Cloud cover has decreased over the past 39 years globally, and temperatures have risen during that time. This global decrease in cloud cover alone could account for all surface warming observed since the 1970s.'[11]So more solar radiation (and galatic positioning) causes fewer cosmic rays, which cause the creation of fewer clouds, which leads to warming. This was confirmed with the Svensmark experiement: 'Preliminary results show that these faux cosmic rays indeed have an effect on the atmosphere: When high energy protons stream in, production of nanometer-sized particles in the atmosphere increases by more than ten times.'[12]In addition, for the predictions made by the AGW theory and the cosmic ray/solar theory, the latter is the effects currently being experienced.[6] For example, the AGW theory predicts the fastest tropospheric warming will be in the tropics, and the cosmic ray/solar theory predicts the warming will be uniform. The surface warming is similar or greater than troposphere warming. The latter theory wins.[6]Finally, it is clear the cosmic ray/temperature correlation:     [6].  'The graph below a correlation between the cosmic ray counts and the global troposphere temperature radiosonde data. The cosmic ray scale is inverted to correspond to increasing temperatures. High solar activity corresponds to low cosmic ray counts, reduced low cloud cover, and higher temperatures. The upper panel shows the troposphere temperatures in blue and the cosmic ray count in red. The lower panel shows the match achieved by removing El Nino, the North Atlantic Oscillation, volcanic aerosols and a linear trend of 0.14 Celsius/decade.'[6]III. Oceans Are Causing Global Warming  'Current research also shows that Earth's oceans are now beginning to cool. It is also now clear that temperatures over the last century correlate far better with cycles in oceans than they do with carbon dioxide; and, the temperature cycles in oceans are caused by cycles of the sun.'[4]The PDO correlates extremely well with global warming, and is not caused by humans.[13] Ocean currents correlate better than CO2:  [14]In fact,  Changes in global atmospheric CO2 are lagging about 11–12 months behind changes in global sea surface temperature, 9.5-10 months behind changes in global air surface temperature, and 9 months behind changes in global lower troposphere temperature.  Changes in ocean temperatures appear to explain a substantial part of the observed changes in atmospheric CO2 since January 1980.[18]  IV. The 1500-Year Cycle   The Medieval Warm Period (MWP) was globally warmer than today, and in both hemispheres:  'Chinese temperatures were 2 to 3 degrees C higher than present during China's climate optimum.' '...during the Medieval Warming... . Temperatures may have been as much as 2.5 degrees C warmer [than today] due to a southward shift of the climate belts.' '...the central Argentinean area had more precipitation during the Medieval Warming than today. Temperatures may have been as much as 2.5 degrees C warmer due to a southward shift of the tropical rainbelts.' 'The largest anomaly was a rapid warming-4 degrees C-between 350 B.C and A.D 450, reflecting a warmer climate in equatorial East Africa.' 'On Signy Island, halfway between Antarctica and the southern tip of South America, there clearly shows the Roman Warming..., the Dark Ages [cooling]..., the Medieval Warming, the Little Ice Age, and the 20th century warming-which is cooler to date than the Medieval Warming.'[15]  From Medieval manuscripts, it is easy to confirm that Europe was warm during the MWP, but so was the southern hemisphere:    [16]. This means it was a global event, and not a see-saw hemisphere event. 'Indirect evidence suggests that the average temperature was as much as 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer [during the Medieval Warm Period] than today.'[17] [17]  V. Three Equal Warmings                                    PeriodLengthTrend(Degrees C per decade)Significance1860-1880210.163Yes1910-1940310.15Yes1975-1998240.166Yes1975-2009350.161Yes  [19]  [20]  Conclusion Putting this all together, 'For example, the authors of a paper by NASA's JPL remark '...has compared the minimum aa [index of geomagnetic activity] values with the Earth's surface temperature record and found a correlation of 0.95 between the two data sets starting in 1885. The solar irradiance [solar activity] proxy developed from the aa minima continues to track the Earth's surface temperature until the present.''[21] There. Cosmic rays, the sun, and all the Earth's natural cycles have a .95 correlation.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank Magic8000 for presenting his arguments. My opponent begins by stating seven premises of global warming that he claims almost all scientists believe. I will leave 1-5 as is, but I will first attempt to counter premises 6 and 7 because those simply aren't true. I. The Temperature of Earth's Atmosphere Has Been Increasing Slightly, but No Longer Continues to IncreaseLooking at the bare temperature statistics, there has now been no net warming since 1997 - 15 years with CO2 rising with no global temperature increase. Since 2003, the trend has actually been negative.'[1]Then why is it that the 2000s had the warmest years on record? 'The “hottest year” claim depends on minute fractions of a degree difference between years. Even NASA's James Hansen, the leading proponent of man-made global warming in the U.S., conceded the 'hottest year' rankings are essentially meaningless. Hansen explained that 2010 differed from 2005 by less than 2 hundredths of a degree F (that's 0.018F).'[2]Here is a graph showing the last 35 years of temperature records, including a trend line: [4] As shown, temperatures are actually beginning to trend downward as the ocean cycles reverse.  This trend is actually set to continue for the next two decades: 'Because PDO cycles last 25 to 30 years, Easterbrook expects the cooling trend to continue for another 2 decades or so.  Easterbrook, in fact, documents 40 such alternating periods of warming and cooling over the past 500 years, with similar data going back 15,000 years.  He further expects the flipping of the ADO to add to the current downward trend.'[3]Even though this contradicts both many computer simulations and the IPCC's official claims, it is clear that they have not been so right before:      [5]That's a negative 0.1 degree C decrease in the last 10 years, contrary to my opponent's claim.     II. The Increase In Global Temperature Does Not Correlate With the Increases of Greenhouse Gases Looking back at history, premise 7 is simply not true:   [6]In fact, CO2 seems to lag behind temperature. 'In fact, the air's CO2 content did not begin to rise until 400 to 1,000 years after the planet began to warm. Ice cores provide a detailed record of local temperature and CO2 concentrations. A study finds that the CO2 increase lagged Antarctic deglacial warming by 800 +/- 200 years. CO2 does not seem to be following that well.'[5]This can be illustrated in this graph:        [7]It is easy to see that CO2 correlates with temperature increases, not the other way around. On a more modern frame,  'In the last decade, there has been no clear warming trend. In the last century, much of the warming occurred prior to 1940, when human emissions of CO2 were relatively small compared to today. During the post-war economic boom (when one would have expected the temperature to rise) the world cooled, from the 1940s till the mid-70s (again, this is evident from accepted data used by the IPCC).'[8]This graph shows the non-correlation of temperature and CO2 in the same timeframe:  [5]Or to take a hot topic of conversation, the Arctic. This century's Arctic temperatures do not really correlate with CO2 increases:   [9]In conclusion, ice core data also shows CO2 count is rising. When examining the temperature and CO2 data, the correlation is striking. CO2 only correlates on a .44 scale (r = .44). This means the correlation rates from “fair” to “poor”, which is bad news for an alarmist. It shows the correlation is not very strong.[10][11]In addition, by the greenhouse theory, both poles should be warming. However, the Antarctic is not (I'll leave the Arctic alone for space reasons): 'If the greenhouse thoery were valid, temperatures in the Arctic and the Antarctic would have risen several degrees Celsius since 1940 due to the huge emissions of man-made CO2... Recently, a team led by the University of Chicago's Peter Doran published a paper in Nature saying, '...our spatial analysis of Antarctic meteorological data demonstrates a net cooling on the Antarctic continent between 1966 and 2000'. The data from 21 Antarctic surface stations show an average continental decline of 0.008 degrees C from 1978 to 1998, and the infrared data from satellites operating since 1979 show a decline of 0.42 degrees C per decade. They report that satellite imaging shows increases in Souther Ocean sea ice parameters from 1978 to 1996 and an increase in the length of the sea-ice season in the 1990s'[12]III. My Opponent's Main Points  I will attack each of my opponent's points one by one. III.i. This is irrelevant, because I already showed that CO2 does not correlate with temperature. III.ii. Again, irrelevant.III.iii. Maybe, but, 'A short-term correlation does not imply that the CO2 increase caused the temperature increase. Causation can be inferred if there is a correlation over several cycles of CO2 concentration changes, with the CO2 change preceding the temperature change. The actual climate history shows no such correlation, and there is no compelling evidence that the recent rise in temperature was caused by CO2. Temperatures have been variable over time, and do not correlate to CO2 concentration. When CO2 concentrations were 10 times higher than they are now we were in a major ice age. As a greenhouse gas, CO2 is vastly outweighed by (natural) water vapour and clouds, which accounts for over 70% of the greenhouse effect. Human-related CO2 emissions soared after 1940. Yet most of the 20th century's world-wide temperature increase occurred beforehand.'[5] This point isn't really relevant either because it's having no effects on the climate.III.iv. Explain further how this is important.  III.v. Actually, this is not happening: '...satellite and high-altitude balloon data confirm that the lower atmosphere is not trapping lots of additional heat due to higher CO2 concentrations. It is hard to know how fast the Earth's highly variable surface is warming, but it is warming faster than the lower atmosphere where the CO2 is accumulating. This is strong evidence that CO2 is not the primary climate factor.'[12] Neither has CO2 caused cooling happened in the stratosphere: '...stratospheric cooling is predicted to occur due to both greenhouse gasses and ozone depletion. The ozone concentration in the stratosphere has declined from 1970 until 1995, and has not declined at all since then due to the implementation of the Montreal Protocol, which limits the emission of ozone reducing CFCs... The lower stratosphere temperature has not declined at all since 1995 (when the ozone levels are stable or slightly increasing), so the data does not indicate any greenhouse gas cooling of the stratosphere. In fact, it appears that there has been a slight warming of the lower stratosphere since 1995, the opposite of what is predicted by computer models of the greenhouse gas effects. The stratosphere cooling indicated by the radiosonde data is caused by the changing ozone concentration, not by greenhouse gases.'[5] In the end, a comparison of the records show that the surface has warmed faster than the troposphere, the opposite of what is predicted by the theory of CO2 warming. Observations agree with the Sun-Cosmic ray warming theory.[5]III.vi. Actually, on wavelengths, 'Comparing the CO2 and H2O absorption spectra shows that much of the CO2 spectrum overlaps with that of water. Parts of the CO2 spectrum are already fully saturated. Adding more CO2 will result in ever diminishing effects as more of the available wavelengths become saturated. The temperature effect of increasing CO2 concentration is approximately logarithmic. This means if doubling the CO2 concentration from 300 ppm to 600 ppm, a 300 ppm increase, causes the temperature to rise by 1 degree C it would take another 600 ppm increase to add a further 1 degree C temperature gain.'[5] Meaning that CO2 cannot have a 1-to-1 linear relationship with temperature, even though most correlation graphs show that.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank Subutai for this debate.My opponent rebuttals summarized.1. Warming stopped in the 90s2. No correlation with CO2 and temperature 2a. CO2 lags temperature2b. Antarctic isn't warming2c. Climate in the 40s3. My main points 1. Warming stopped Con says James Hansen claimed the hottest year records are meaningless. We need the context here, just what Con posted it seems like Hansen was saying the differences between 2005 and 2010 were meaningless and small, not that it wasn't the warmest year. So it's a red herring and does nothing to rebut the actual record.Con commits 2 fallacies to prove his claim here, category error and a sweeping generalization. You can't make long term signal claims based on short term noise and this is exactly what Con is trying to do. A large impact on short term temperatures can happen, such as El Nino (Con posted a chart that points out El Nino, but Con doesn't seem to take this in account and still claims that global warming stopped.) El Nino is an oceanic cycle that can suppress global warming for a while, but these cycles do nothing about long-term trends. [1]Foster and Rahmstorf used several tools to filter out short term noise to show the true long term trend [2] [3]  You can see the complete removal process in the first videoI'm curious why Con posted the first chart, as it actually proves my point. Skeptical Science explains [4]   Trend lines showing the sudden jump in temperatures in the 1995 La Niña (Green lines) and the 1998 (Pink lines) El Niño events. Brown line indicates overall increase in temperatures.The chart above clearly shows that temperatures have gone up...The overall trend from 1979 through November 2010 (Brown line) shows an unmistakable rise.Air temperatures are not the only or even the best way of determining the trends of warming. Most of the heat goes into our oceans [5]. So if Con's claim is correct, we should see a drop in the ocean’s heat records too. However the records show that the Earth is indeed warming, as if 1995 was nothing special.  [6] [7]The claim is unsubstantiated and debunked.2. No correlationAs said above, there can be short term cooling over long term trends -such as La Nina- because CO2 isn’t the only forcing that exists. It's a well established fact in physics that Co2 does cause warming. To claim there can’t be a correlation is a contradiction to well established physical discoveries. [8]2a. CO2 lags temperatureCO2 doesn't always initiate warming, as I said in my opening statement a forcing can naturally change climate. Co2 did however amplify the warming in times past, in fact roughly 90% of the global warming happened right after the CO2 increase. The Antarctic ice core data does show changes in the CO2 does follow the changes in temperatures by about 800 years. However, we can't conclude that CO2 always lags temperature, as to do so would be another compositional fallacy. The changes in the temperature at that time are because of the changes of the Earth's orbit causing the Earth to obtain more seasonal sunlight. Why a lag?The lag is easily explained. As it’s just the Milankovitch effect. When ocean temperatures rise, the oceans will release more CO2, then this release will contribute the warming trend, causing more CO2 to be released . Thus CO2 can lag and lead [9]Shakun et al has shown that historically CO2 has mostly led temperatures“...Here we construct a record of global surface temperature from 80 proxy records and show that temperature is correlated with and generally lags CO2 during the last (that is, the most recent) deglaciation...These observations, together with transient global climate model simulations, support the conclusion that an antiphased hemispheric temperature response to ocean circulation changes superimposed on globally in-phase warming driven by increasing CO2... [10]See the second video for more information2b. Antarctic isn't warmingA paper produced by nature concluded 'Central West Antarctica among the most rapidly warming regions on Earth' [11]. The Arctic argument can be debunked with what was already said above.2c. Climate in the 40sThe cooling was because of global dimming by aerosol emissions. This argument assumes a strawman, that CO2 is the only thing that controls climate. No proponent of A.G.W. claims this. The claim is that CO2 is the main driver of today’s warming.Take Mount Pinatubo for example. It dropped temperature, but this doesn't debunk CO2 correlations. Same in the 40s. There was a lot of aerosol pollution, volcanic activity, and solar forcing. All together this explains the cooling and doesn’t debunk my contention.   [12][13][14]This is a well known effect called global dimming [15]3. My main pointsSince I’ve debunked Con’s claims, 1-2 are now relevant3. I don't understand why Con says this is a short-term correlation or that it's irrelevant. As the source studied the heat loss since 1970 and it’s relevant as the heat would come back causing warming. Con then repeats what's already been debunked. CO2 is the main driver of climate today. Some things such as water vapor isn’t a forcing agent, it’s a “feedback loop” as when CO2 levels go up, more water vapor gets in the atmosphere [16]. Con’s rebuttal is not really relevant to the argument.4. Skeptical Science explains it better than I could.“If an increased greenhouse effect was causing warming, we would expect nights to warm faster than days. This is because the greenhouse effect operates day and night..if global warming was caused by the sun, we would expect the warming.. to be greatest in daytime temperatures.... we observe is a decrease in cold nights greater than the decrease in cold days, and an increase in warm nights greater than the increase in warm days... This is consistent with greenhouse warming.” [17]5. From what I found on google the source of what Con posted is from the book 'Every 1500 years, Unstoppable Global Warming' [18]. However it's a poor source, since I couldn't find the actual paper that's referenced. I do know there's a paper by John Christy and Roy Spencer that showed the troposphere was warming slower than the surface [19], which would be a problem in our current models. The information in these papers soon turned out to be false, as there were several errors made during the study. The adjustments that Christy and Spencer used at first was incorrect, but when the data was adjusted correctly, it was shown to be no problem in the climate models. [20] [21]All data now shows warming in the troposphere and cooling in the stratosphere. [22]The lead authors (including John Christy) said this on the first page“Previously reported discrepancies between the amount of warming near the surface and higher in the atmosphere have been used to challenge the reliability of climate models and the reality of human-induced global warming... This significant discrepancy no longer exists because errors in the satellite... New data sets have also been developed that do not show such discrepancies.'Con is clearly using outdated sources.6. The claim has actually already been refuted by my argument 6 and 3. In order for CO2 to be saturated, more CO2 shouldn't add an additional greenhouse effect.  'What they found was a drop in outgoing radiation at the wavelength bands that greenhouse gases such as CO2 and methane... The change in outgoing radiation over CO2 bands was consistent with...expectations. Thus the paper found 'direct experimental evidence for a significant increase in the Earth's greenhouse effect...This result has been confirmed by subsequent papers using the latest satellite data... the observed differences in CO2 bands matched the expected changes based on rising CO2 levels. Thus we have empirical evidence that increased CO2 is preventing longwave radiation from escaping out to space.[23] Thanks again Con! Let the voting begin! </t>

    <t>I would like to thank Magic8000 for accepting this debate. I. The Universe and Global WarmingThe current state of the Galaxy and our Sun is affecting our temperatures.I.i. The Rest of the Solar SystemThe Sun clearly is in a warmer phase, because all of the other planets have increasing temperatures as well. 'In 2005 data from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor and Odyssey missions revealed that the carbon dioxide 'ice caps' near Mars's south pole had been diminishing for three summers in a row.Habibullo Abdussamatov, head of space research at St. Petersburg's Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory in Russia, says the Mars data is evidence that the current global warming on Earth is being caused by changes in the sun.'[1]''Global warming on Neptune's moon Triton as well as Jupiter and Pluto, and now Mars has some [scientists] scratching their heads over what could possibly be in common with the warming of all these planets … Could there be something in common with all the planets in our solar system that might cause them all to warm at the same time?''[2] Two things can be drawn from this. One, that if other planets are warming, that it is only natural for the Earth to be warming as well. And second, that even if all these planets did have natural causes, then that is a sign of Earth's natural climatic change, instead of man-made. I.ii. The Position of the Milky Way GalaxyEvery approximately 135 million years, Earth enters a more populated area of the Milky Way, and as a result, more cosmic rays hit the Earth, which causes cooling. Currently, we are in a less populated area of the Milky Way, which means that less of these cosmic rays will be hitting the Earth, which means less cloud formation, and of course, warming. [3] for the source on this hypothesis. The sun can also cause this through evaporation.II. Earthly CausesThere are many internal causes of Global Warming as well. II.i. Ocean Current Anomalies Ocean temperature anomalies seem to be rising-along with the temperature. '...one can model past temperatures as a linear trend (that started well before CO2 was added in any substantial quantity) and periodic bumps... ...temperatures over the last 100+ years look a lot like a linear trend plus ocean cycle-driven bumps'[4] What is causing all the bumps?: [4]As shown in the graph, the PDO, or ocean currents, temperature has affected the average Earth's temperature.    II.ii. Clouds: A Continuation of Point I.ii.I mentioned about the position of the Milky Way Galaxy and the Sun in regards to these 'cosmic rays'. Here is a more in depth look at the effects of position. 'The implications, if true, had potentially enormous implications for the debate about natural causes of warming. When the sun is very active, it can be thought of as pushing away cosmic rays from the Earth, reducing their incidence. When the sun is less active, we see more cosmic rays. This is fairly well understood. But if Svensmark was correct, it would mean that periods of high solar output should coincide with reduced cloud formation (due to reduced cosmic race incidence), which in turn would have a warming effect on the Earth, since less sunlight would be reflected back into space before hitting the Earth.Here was a theory, then, that would increase the theoretical impact on climate of an active sun, and better explain why solar irradiance changes might be underestimating the effect of solar output changes on climate and temperatures.'[4]'Since he first suggested his hypothesis over a decade and a half ago, Svensmark and other researchers have slowly been putting together research to test it.' The results were: 'Scientists found that when shielding was removed and natural cosmic rays allowed to hit the chamber, cloud seeding increased dramatically, and it increased substantially again when additional artificial cosmic rays were added. Svensmark appears to have gotten it right.'[5] Proof here is in the next points. III. The 1500-Year Cycle This has to do with a cycle of the climate that can explain the warming. 'Through at least the last million years, a moderate 1500-year warm-cold cycle has been superimposed over the longer, stronger Ice Ages and warm interglacials.'[6]  Here is a graph related to this:  [7]There are two things we can conclude from this graph. First, that up-and-down cycles are normal for the long-term climate. This century's global warming is nothing new. The second thing we can conclude, is that today's global warming is not as bad as the Medieval Warm Period's peak yet, and the Medieval Warm Period was less than the Holocene Maximum Period.    'Even more important, the earth is not 'the warmest it has ever been.' In fact, the earth was much warmer during the Medieval Warm Period when human agriculture flourished!'[7]'The scientists found evidence that on average, every 1,470 years, plus or minus 500 years, cold, ice-bearing waters, which today circulate around southern Greenland, pushed as far south as Great Britain.'[8] There seems to be a full cycle of up-down-up temperatures of the climate every 1470 years. And this goes as far back as at least 1 million years ago. Currently, we are in an upswing of temperatures, just coming off of the Little Ice Age, the peak to be in a few hundred years, making the peak-to-peak difference between today's global warming and the Medieval Warm Period a little less than 1500 years. So today's Global Warming is a natural, cyclical occurence.    IV. The Sun: The Proof of Theories I.ii and II.iiThe sun's cycles have a lot to do with temperatures also.  'In this chamber, 63 CERN scientists from 17 European and American institutes have done what global warming doomsayers said could never be done — demonstrate that cosmic rays promote the formation of molecules that in Earth’s atmosphere can grow and seed clouds, the cloudier and thus cooler it will be. Because the sun’s magnetic field controls how many cosmic rays reach Earth’s atmosphere (the stronger the sun’s magnetic field, the more it shields Earth from incoming cosmic rays from space), the sun determines the temperature on Earth.'[9]'Svensmark matched the data on cosmic rays from the neutron monitor in Climax, Colorado, with the satellite measurements of solar irradiance from 1970 to 1990. Over the period between 1975 and 1989, he found cosmic rays decreased by 1.2 percent annually, amplifying the sun's change in irradiance about four-fold'[6]So, as the sun's activity increases, so does the temperature. This below graph shows the correlation:   [10]This graph clearly shows that temperature goes up and down with solar activity, because an increase in solar activity directly correlates with an increase in average temperature 1-2 years later. And as a final side note, I would like to present this graph that helps disprove the anthropogenic cause theory, regarding again, ocean temperature anomalies:     [4]So 'nature' created the same temperature trend as 'humans' did.</t>

    <t>To save on space I will summerize my opponents arguments1. The sun is warming since other planets are warming.2. The sun via cosmic rays are causing global warming.3. Oceans are causing global warming.4. We’re going though a 1500-Year Cycle4a. The Medieval Warm Period5. Temperature of 1895-1946 vs 1957-20081. The sun is warming since other planets are warming.The sun isn’t warming at all, in fact it’s cooling. A study by Usoskin in 2005 debunks the claim that the Earth is warming due to a warming sun. He writes '...during these last 30 years the solar total irradiance, solar UV irradiance and cosmic ray flux has not shown any significant secular trend, so that at least this most recent warming episode must have another source.' [1]In fact, the sun has been contributing to some cooling in the past few decades. [2]Other studies have also debunked the claimA study by Erlykin says“We deduce that the maximum recent increase in the mean surface temperature of the Earth which can be ascribed to solar activity is 14% of the observed global warming.' [3]'Although solar and volcanic effects appear to dominate most of the slow climate variations within the past thousand years, the impacts of greenhouse gases have dominated since the second half of the last century.' -Ammann [4]'The variations measured from spacecraft since 1978 are too small to have contributed appreciably to accelerated global warming over the past 30 years.'- Foukal [5]So what about the other planets? First off Con commits the fallacy of composition, his reasoning is “if 1 planet is warming naturally all planets are warming naturally”. You must agree other planets are very different from Earth.Mars: Observations show Mars is experiancing short term regional warming, but not long term global warming. [6]Pluto: MIT scientists explain “Pluto’s orbit is much more elliptical than that of the other planets, and its rotational axis is tipped by a large angle relative to its orbit. Both factors could contribute to drastic seasonal changes.” [7]Jupiter: Global warming isn’t happening on Jupiter, it’s predicted. It's said to warm not because of the sun, but because “the loss of these atmospheric whirlpools, the average temperature on Jupiter will change by as much as 10 degrees Celsius, getting warmer near the equator and cooler at the poles,' [8]Neptune: Neptune is warming. Its orbit is 164 years, our observations are less than a third of Neptune's year. The climate modeling of Neptune says Neptune is undergoing a seasonal change into summer. [9]This also would cause Triton's atmosphere to become thinner, causing warming. [10]2. The sun via cosmic rays are causing global warming.Looking at the data disproves this hypothesis. While cosmic rays are high the temperature is also high.Annual average GCR counts per minute (blue - note that numbers decrease going up the left vertical axis, because lower GCRs should mean higher temperatures) vs. annual average global surface temperature (red, right vertical axis)From NOAA [11], The Neutron Monitor Database [12], and Skeptical Science [13]'between 1970 and 1985 the cosmic ray flux, although still behaving similarly to the temperature, in fact lags it and cannot be the cause of its rise. Thus changes in the cosmic ray flux cannot be responsible for more than 15% of the temperature increase'- Krivova [14]'galactic cosmic rays appear to play a minor role for atmospheric aerosol formation events, and so for the connected aerosol-climate effects as well.'- Kulmala. Correlations between low clouds and cosmic rays broke in 1991, then cloud cover began to lag cosmic rays by 6 months [15] ,even though cloud formation should happen within a few days [16]Svensmark said the loss of correlation was because of long term calibration drift in ISCCP satellites, but the ISCCP themselves disagree. Sloan and Wolfendale pointed out Chernobyl disaster should've produced increased cloud cover according to this hypothesis, but there was none. 'In this chamber, 63 CERN scientists from 17 European and American institutes have done what global warming doomsayers said could never be done — demonstrate that cosmic rays promote the formation of molecules that in Earth’s atmosphere can grow and seed clouds,”This was based off a false understanding of the CERN paperSee the first video.3. Oceans are causing global warming.The oceans would cool when its heat goes to the atmosphere. Observations show oceans are warming [17]. The oceans are actually good evidence for the resolution.'the observed ocean heat-content changes are consistent with those expected from anthropogenic forcing, which broadens the basis for claims that an anthropogenic signal has been detected in the global climate system.' [18]4. 1500-Year CycleCon makes another category error here. There’s defiantly a 1500 year climate cycle. We know that from ice core data from Greenland -as Con cited-, but these events known as the “Dansgaard-Oeschger events” don’t increase the global temperature. It’s only a temperature shift or a see-saw temperature change in the 2 hemispheres. [19]Also see the second video.4a. The Medieval Warm PeriodCon cites the Medieval Warm Period to try and prove his claim about the 1500 year cycle. However there’s no evidence that shows the MWP was as warm globally as it is today.NOAA says“In summary, it appears that the late 20th and early 21st centuries are likely the warmest period the Earth has seen in at least 1200 years.” [20]and“The idea of a global or hemispheric 'Medieval Warm Period' that was warmer than today however, has turned out to be incorrect.” [21]Here’s the differences5. Temperature of 1895-1946 vs 1957-2008At the very end Con posts a chart of the temperature of 1895-1946 and 1957-2008. Both are very similar and seem to prove climate change is by nature. Based on data from Hadlet, GISS, NOAA, NCEP R1, NCEP TCR, ERA-40, and AMTI, Skeptical Science formed these 2 charts around those time periods. It’s close enough to see the claim is wrong[22]Back to ConSources in link below[1] </t>

    <t>'On the rebuttals, apologies. I misworded the debate structure. It should be 'no rebuttals by pro.' Just present your arguments affirming the resolution. Thanks.'As said by Con, I will present my argumentsThe typical argument is like this [1]  The Earth's atmosphere keeps the planet much warmer than it would be without an atmosphere.  The main gases which contribute to this are carbon dioxide, methane and water vapor. Collectively these are called greenhouse gases.  The ability of these gases to act as greenhouse gases can be shown in a laboratory.  The quantity of these greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has increased sharply since the Industrial Revolution, and their concentration continues to do so.  The concentration of these gases has increased as a consequence of human activity.  The temperature of Earth's atmosphere has been increasing and continues to increase.  The increase in global temperature correlates with the increases of greenhouse gases. Just about every scientist agrees with these 7 premises. Even some skeptics do too and I believe Con does (although I could be wrong). The following premise is the disputed one8. The increase in temperature has been caused by the increase in greenhouse gases from humans.We know the climate on Earth has changed before. We must understand that in order for a climate to rise naturally, A forcing must exist to force the climate to change. There's no known forcing that fits the fingerprint of the evidence we see, except one, anthropogenic greenhouse gases.We know that humans are producing 30 billion tons of Co2 a year in the atmosphere [3]. Let's see evidence that follows from this.I will paste 6 evidences from “10 Indicators of a Human Fingerprint on Climate Change” [2]1. When we measure the type of carbon accumulating in the atmosphere, we observe more of the type of carbon that comes from fossil fuels [4]2. This is corroborated by measurements of oxygen in the atmosphere. Oxygen levels are falling in line with the amount of carbon dioxide rising, just as you'd expect from fossil fuel burning which takes oxygen out of the air to create carbon dioxide [5]3. So we know humans are raising CO2 levels. What's the effect? Satellites measure less heat escaping out to space, at the particular wavelengths that CO2 absorbs heat, thus finding 'direct experimental evidence for a significant increase in the Earth's greenhouse effect'. [6]4. If an increased greenhouse effect is causing global warming, we should see certain patterns in the warming. For example, the planet should warm faster at night than during the day. This is indeed being observed [7]5. With the lower atmosphere (the troposphere) warming and the upper atmosphere (the stratosphere) cooling, another consequence is the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere, otherwise known as the tropopause, should rise as a consequence of greenhouse warming. This has been observed [8]. This also contradicts the hypothesis that the earth is warming because of solar activity.6. ....A closer look at the downward radiation finds more heat returning at CO2 wavelengths, leading to the conclusion that 'this experimental data should effectively end the argument by skeptics that no experimental evidence exists for the connection between greenhouse gas increases in the atmosphere and global warming.'</t>

<h>1st water is a renuable resource and we shouldn't worry about whether or not it takes more water for a cow then wheat, because it is all going to be renewed and if we chose not to eat those cows they would consume more water to live longer.  You could post the arguement to that that plants create oxygen and when we eat more and more plants that is depleting the oxygen so if everyone turns vegetarian we will start running out of oxygen. Neither of these I believe will have a big effect on humanity I believed was just stating the parralex argument that seemed to work with it.  Second We don't need to worry about fossil fuels causing climate change ohh that's right they used to call it global warming but since they were wrong and it didn't exist they changed it here is why climate change is false, 'Those who belive that there is no evidence for global warning often argue that extremely accurate temperature gauges that can measure temperatures to within .01-degrees Celsius have shown no evidence of global warming over the last 25 years. While some can consider this a plateau, these satellite readings correspond with land readings taken for years before this; there has been little recorded climbs in temperature.  Scientific Debate While many scientists are willing to go on record to point out trends in global warming, more than 17,000 scientists have signed a petition circulated by the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine saying that they see no evidence of global warming at all. Less formal surveys amongst climatologists have pointed in the same direction.  No Future Prediction While it is tempting to look ahead at what global warming could do if left unchecked or untreated, it is currently impossible to predict actual climate change in this manner. There are currently no computers sophisticated enough to extrapolate from current data in a reliable pattern that can indicate future climate temperatures.'(1)  Next I would like to say why animal rights shouldn't be a question. If you are an evolutionist you believe in survival of the fittest and that the better smarter species will weed out the lesser species, yes of course now days we try and keep a couple around but working against extinction of animals is very condridicting if your an evolutionist.  If you area Christian or Catholic or Mormon or Judiest you believe in the Torah 1st five books of the bible which say man is to rule over all the animals, 'Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.'(2)  So to all those religions their God says it is ethical to eat and rule over them.  And you say that it matters that a cow has 80 percent human DNA so they are part human well you also sited that rice is 15 percent well that means that are also part human so if you believe one you have to believe the others or that's almost unethical to say one human cousin is more important then the other. That is if you believe that which I don't. I'm going to start a Rice rights group  Rights for  Intellectual  Creatures that shouldn't be  Eaten  Rice lol  Now we should attempt better conditions for these animals like maybe put them to sleep before they are slaughtered not that it matters that much what an animal is feeling.  Most people fight for animal rights and no pain for animals but they believe abortion is fine they are just as alive in that stomach as some animal is but that child is going to grow into a living breathing human that could be having a debate like this in the future,so if you count feeling pain as a sign of being alive like a human you better not be an abortion supporter,'With the advent of sonograms and live-action ultrasound images, neonatologists and nurses are able to see unborn babies at 20 weeks gestation react physically to outside stimuli such as sound, light and touch. The sense of touch is so acute that even a single human hair drawn across an unborn baby's palm causes the baby to make a fist.  Did you know that this 20-week-old unborn child can feel pain? Surgeons entering the womb to perform corrective procedures on tiny unborn babies have seen those babies flinch, jerk and recoil from sharp objects and incisions.  'The neural pathways are present for pain to be experienced quite early by unborn babies,' explains Steven Calvin, M.D., perinatologist, chair of the Program in Human Rights Medicine, University of Minnesota, where he teaches obstetrics.  Medical facts of fetal pain Anatomical studies have documented that the body's pain network'the spino-thalamic pathway'is established by 20 weeks gestation.  ' 'At 20 weeks, the fetal brain has the full complement of brain cells present in adulthood, ready and waiting to receive pain signals from the body, and their electrical activity can be recorded by standard electroencephalography (EEG).' ' Dr. Paul Ranalli, neurologist, University of Toronto  ' An unborn baby at 20 weeks gestation 'is fully capable of experiencing pain. ' Without question, [abortion] is a dreadfully painful experience for any infant subjected to such a surgical procedure.' ' Robert J. White, M.D., PhD., professor of neurosurgery, Case Western University  Unborn babies have heightened sensitivities Unborn babies at 20 weeks development actually feel pain more intensely than adults. This is a 'uniquely vulnerable time, since the pain system is fully established, yet the higher level pain-modifying system has barely begun to develop,' according to Dr. Ranalli.  'Having administered anesthesia for fetal surgery, I know that on occasion we need to administer anesthesia directly to the fetus, because even at these early gestational ages the fetus moves away from the pain of the stimulation,' stated David Birnbach, M.D., president of the Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology and self-described as 'pro-choice,' in testimony before the U.S. Congress.  Given the medical evidence that unborn babies experience pain, compassionate people are viewing abortion more and more as an inhumane and intolerable brutality against defenseless human beings.  The unborn baby at 20 weeks Fetal development is already quite advanced at 20 weeks gestation:  ' The skeleton is complete and reflexes are present at 42 days.  ' Electrical brain wave patterns can be recorded at 43 days. This is usually ample evidence that 'thinking' is taking place in the brain.  ' The fetus has the appearance of a miniature baby, with complete fingers, toes and ears at 49 days.  ' All organs are functioning'stomach, liver, kidney, brain'and all systems are intact at 56 days.  ' By 20 weeks, the unborn child has hair and working vocal cords, sucks her thumb, grasps with her hands and kicks. She measures 12 inches.'(3)  Your last point about healthy sets doesn't have to do with ethics but I would like to see a test where they eat a doctors alloted mount of meat and healthy vegetables because the average American is a meat eater and the average American is obese so that test doesn't really work.  My conclusion  Eat meat there is nothing unethical about it.  It is a great source of protein.  And it tastes darn good and just the fact that eating a nice steak can make a good day for someone that's proof enough for me that it's a good thing.</h>

<h>Ecological  You state, “1st water is a renuable resource and we shouldn't worry about whether or not it takes more water for a cow then wheat, because it is all going to be renewed and if we chose not to eat those cows they would consume more water to live longer. “  Believe it or not, water usage is a concern. Though fresh water is replenished by the water cycle we have a limited amount at a given time and it takes vast amounts of energy (non-sustainable) to treat the water. In 50 years, our population will increase by 3 billion people. It will become increasingly difficult to provide water for everyone.  You can read about it here: http://www.whyzz.com...  Also, you say that if we didn't eat the cows, they would consume the water anyway. The meat industry breeds these animals in MASSIVE quantities. They are forced to reproduce much more frequently than if they were wild. If we stopped breeding them for slaughter their numbers would decrease dramatically in a few years. Also, you did not consider that meat production not only takes the water the animals drink directly, but all the water it takes to grow the food they eat.  You state that if we all switch to eating plants, we would decrease the world plant population and thus decrease the oxygen on earth. Most of the plants farmers grow are fed to meat animals. If we switched to plant diets there would be more plants, and, according to you, more oxygen. http://www.news.cornell.edu......  About global warming, if you don't believe it is a concern, I'm not sure what to tell you. You might consider having a look at some of these articles: http://www.huffingtonpost.ca...http://www.independent.co.uk... Animal Rights  You state: “Next I would like to say why animal rights shouldn't be a question. If you are an evolutionist you believe in survival of the fittest and that the better smarter species will weed out the lesser species, yes of course now days we try and keep a couple around but working against extinction of animals is very condridicting if your an evolutionist. “  Evolution is not a philosophy, it is a scientific concept. Survival of the fittest is not a code of conduct for life, it was never intended to be that. Evolution does not define morality.  Just because something behaves a certain way in nature does not make it ethical (e.g. causing other species' extinction).  97% of scientists accept evolution as scientific truth. This does not change what is ethical. http://www.people-press.org... I want to bring to attention that this is not a religious debate. It is a debate on ethics, which to some people does include religion, so I will address it briefly.   I am a protestant Christian and I think that evolution is probably true. I don't see a conflict between Christianity and evolution. God has the power to bring about life on earth in the way he chooses. I believe this way to be evolution. All the life on earth shares some percentage of DNA. This makes sense if you believe they come from the same Creator.  You mention that the Bible gives authority to man to rule over the creatures of the Earth. Does this mean we can do whatever we want to them? No, we must take care of them. Before the flood, God forbade the eating of meat. After the flood, he designated certain animals as “clean” to eat. Does this remove our responsibility to rule over the creatures with respect?  Here are some other things the bible has to say: 'The wolf and the lamb will feed together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox, but dust will be the serpent's food. They will neither hunt nor destroy on all my holy mountain,' says the LORD.” -Isaiah 65:25 “The godly care for their animals, but the wicked are always cruel. “ - Proverbs 12:10  “Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain. “ -Deuteronomy 25:4  “But ask the animals, and they will teach you, or ask the birds of the air, and they will tell you. Speak to the earth, and it will teach you, or let the fish of the sea tell you. Every one of these knows that the hand of the Lord has done this. The life of every creature and the breath of all people are in God’s hand.” -Job 12:7-10 (NCV)   Many early Christians were vegetarian, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, John Chrysostom, and Basil the Great to name a few. In some early church writings, Matthew, Peter and James (Brother of Jesus and first leader of the New Jerusalem Church) were all vegetarian. Clement wrote, 'It is far better to be happy than to have your bodies act as graveyards for animals. The Apostle Matthew partook of seeds, nuts and vegetables, without flesh'.   God giving us dominion over the animals does not give us license to mistreat them. God rules over us, and he is merciful to us. We rule over the creatures of the earth, should we not be merciful?    I do not think we should give rice plants rights. We only share 15% of our DNA with it. Plants have no brain, no central nervous system. There is no reason to think that plants have emotion or feel pain.There is a reason to think animals have emotion and feel pain. Animals are closer to us than plants, some animals are very close to us. Even bacteria share about 2% of our DNA. Does this give them rights? No. When you wash your hands, you kill thousands of bacteria. If you have ever felt pain, than you can surely understand why we should hesitate to inflict pain on the things that can feel it (animals, not plants and bacteria).  I agree with you about abortion. For the same reasons I think we should not kill animals, I feel we should not kill unborn humans. But this debate isn't about abortion.  Human Consumption  I'm not sure what you are saying about the health implications of a vegetarian diet. 8 years more of life is 8 years more of life. To me, that indicates it is healthy to be a vegetarian. Yes, there are many healthy, long-lived people who eat meat, but a diet without meat can be just as healthy (or possibly more-so). http://www.huffingtonpost.com......  You conclude: “Eat meat there is nothing unethical about it.”  18,000 children die every day for lack of food. If the entire nation switched to a completely plant-based diet, there would be 5 times more protein food than the meat produced. We feed farm animals enough to feed 800,000,000 people every year. This world needs all the extra food it can get. http://usatoday30.usatoday.com... “And it tastes darn good and just the fact that eating a nice steak can make a good day for someone that's proof enough for me that it's a good thing.“  Well, maybe punching my neighbor in the nose would “make a good day” for my neighbor's ex-wife, but that doesn't make it ethical.  Note: I apologize if my arguments seem a little strong, I'm just trying to present the situation as accurately as I can.</h>

<h>Topic:A vegetarian diet is more ethical than a meat-eating diet. I'll take on the Pro position of the debate, meaning I'll argue for vegetarianism.Definitions:A vegetarian is someone who does not eat any meat or fish, but does not necessarily abstain from eating animal derivatives like eggs and milk.By 'ethical' I mean morally right (as opposed to wrong) conduct. This includes examining the issue from both ecological and animal rights standpoints, as well as the implications to us as humans.By a 'meat-eating' diet, we'll just assume the average U.S. consumer (rather than a strict organic meat-eating person).

Most people fight for animal rights and no pain for animals but they believe abortion is fine they are just as alive in that stomach as some animal is but that child is going to grow into a living breathing human that could be having a debate like this in the future,so if you count feeling pain as a sign of being alive like a human you better not be an abortion supporter,'With the advent of sonograms and live-action ultrasound images, neonatologists and nurses are able to see unborn babies at 20 weeks gestation react physically to outside stimuli such as sound, light and touch. The sense of touch is so acute that even a single human hair drawn across an unborn baby's palm causes the baby to make a fist.  Did you know that this 20-week-old unborn child can feel pain? Surgeons entering the womb to perform corrective procedures on tiny unborn babies have seen those babies flinch, jerk and recoil from sharp objects and incisions.  'The neural pathways are present for pain to be experienced quite early by unborn babies,' explains Steven Calvin, M.D., perinatologist, chair of the Program in Human Rights Medicine, University of Minnesota, where he teaches obstetrics.  Medical facts of fetal pain Anatomical studies have documented that the body's pain network'the spino-thalamic pathway'is established by 20 weeks gestation.  ' 'At 20 weeks, the fetal brain has the full complement of brain cells present in adulthood, ready and waiting to receive pain signals from the body, and their electrical activity can be recorded by standard electroencephalography (EEG).' ' Dr. Paul Ranalli, neurologist, University of Toronto  ' An unborn baby at 20 weeks gestation 'is fully capable of experiencing pain. ' Without question, [abortion] is a dreadfully painful experience for any infant subjected to such a surgical procedure.' ' Robert J. White, M.D., PhD., professor of neurosurgery, Case Western University  Unborn babies have heightened sensitivities Unborn babies at 20 weeks development actually feel pain more intensely than adults. This is a 'uniquely vulnerable time, since the pain system is fully established, yet the higher level pain-modifying system has barely begun to develop,' according to Dr. Ranalli.  'Having administered anesthesia for fetal surgery, I know that on occasion we need to administer anesthesia directly to the fetus, because even at these early gestational ages the fetus moves away from the pain of the stimulation,' stated David Birnbach, M.D., president of the Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology and self-described as 'pro-choice,' in testimony before the U.S. Congress.  Given the medical evidence that unborn babies experience pain, compassionate people are viewing abortion more and more as an inhumane and intolerable brutality against defenseless human beings.  The unborn baby at 20 weeks Fetal development is already quite advanced at 20 weeks gestation:  ' The skeleton is complete and reflexes are present at 42 days.  ' Electrical brain wave patterns can be recorded at 43 days. This is usually ample evidence that 'thinking' is taking place in the brain.  ' The fetus has the appearance of a miniature baby, with complete fingers, toes and ears at 49 days.  ' All organs are functioning'stomach, liver, kidney, brain'and all systems are intact at 56 days.  ' By 20 weeks, the unborn child has hair and working vocal cords, sucks her thumb, grasps with her hands and kicks. She measures 12 inches.'(3)  Your last point about healthy sets doesn't have to do with ethics but I would like to see a test where they eat a doctors alloted mount of meat and healthy vegetables because the average American is a meat eater and the average American is obese so that test doesn't really work.  My conclusion  Eat meat there is nothing unethical about it.  It is a great source of protein.  And it tastes darn good and just the fact that eating a nice steak can make a good day for someone that's proof enough for me that it's a good thing.</t>

    <t>Thank you for accepting. :)Let's begin.Ecological ConcernsIn 2006, the United Nations calculated that the total climate-change emissions of animals bred for meat was 18% of the global total; this is more than cars, planes, and all other transportation combined. Besides greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide, cows and pigs produce many other polluting gases.It takes 108 pounds of water to produce one pound of wheat. It takes a pound of beef around 20,000 pounds of water. Farming uses 70% of the water available to humans.The majority of plant food grown on farms is used as animal feed. It takes 8.4 kilograms of plant-food to produce 1 kg of pork. The 7 billion livestock animals in the US consume 5 times as much grain as the entire population directly consumes. A Cornell analysis states: 'Animal protein production requires more than eight times as much fossil-fuel energy than production of plant protein while yielding animal protein that is only 1.4 times more nutritious for humans than the comparable amount of plant protein,''Each year an estimated 41 million tons of plant protein is fed to U.S. livestock to produce an estimated 7 million tons of animal protein for human consumption. About 26 million tons of the livestock feed comes from grains and 15 million tons from forage crops. For every kilogram of high-quality animal protein produced, livestock are fed nearly 6 kg of plant protein.''If all the grain currently fed to livestock in the United States were consumed directly by people, the number of people who could be fed would be nearly 800 million,''More than 302 million hectares of land are devoted to producing feed for the U.S. livestock population -- about 272 million hectares in pasture and about 30 million hectares for cultivated feed grains.''On average, animal protein production in the U.S. requires 28 kilocalories (kcal) for every kcal of protein produced for human consumption. . . . Grain production, on average, requires 3.3 kcal of fossil fuel for every kcal of protein produced.'So, by producing meat, the population loses a vast majority of protein. In addition, the amount of energy and land used is far greater than that of plant food. On top of this, the soil erosion and greenhouse gases produced by raising livestock makes it far less sustainable than plant foods. Animal RightsThe first thing to address here is the most basic question, 'why should we care about the plight of the animals involved?' Ok, that's valid. After all we're humans, we have to look out for our own species first. However, we are the most intelligent of animals (probably), so we can examine ourselves and other species logically. Modern science concludes that humans evolved from other animals, specifically apes. Since we evolved from these creatures, they are basically distant relatives (of course, plants are much more distant relatives). Coming from the same ancestors, we have many similarities to other animals, especially mammals. The DNA of the chimpanzee is 98% identical to that of humans. Of course, not many of us eat chimpanzees. The cow's (Bos taurus) DNA is 80% similar. (Source 1) On the other hand, we share 15% with a rice plant. (Source 2) So what does this similarity mean? This brings us to animal intelligence. A dog, for instance, is thought to hold an intelligence that measures up to a 2 to 2.5 year old human. (Source 3) Pigs are thought to be more intelligent. Some apes are able to communicate with humans via simple sign language. Some chimpanzees have been found to perform some intellectual tasks better than humans. (Source 4) This isn't to say they are more intelligent than humans, it's just a testament to the fact they are somewhat intelligent.It is the widely accepted by scientists that an animal's brain complexity is directly linked to their ability to feel pain and suffering. The Discovery Channel stated, 'Psychologist B.F. Skinner proved that animals feel pain in a clinical test in which animals were shocked with electrical current as they approached their food.' (Source 5) A recent study indicates that even crabs feel pain. (Source 6)Ok, so we've established animals are somewhat intelligent and can feel pain (similarly to that of a young child). Now, does the meat industry cause suffering to the animals used?Well, take a look. A pig's natural lifespan is 15 years, pigs are generally killed for pork at 6 months of age. Male pigs are usually castrated without anesthetic. They often have their tails removed and teeth clipped. Many pigs die in the bad conditions of transit. (Source 7)In 2010, 62 billion animals died for American food. Here's the ones that made it to the slaughterhouse:23,627,000 ducks35,330,800 cattle110,367,000 pigs242,619,000 turkeys8,790,478,000 chickens7.3 billion fish12 billion shellfishIn 2010, the average meat-eater's diet is responsible for 207 animal deaths. At that rate, it is around 16,000 animals over the course of a person's lifespan. (all from source 8)Human ConsumptionThe above arguments must be balanced with this. How is meat useful to humans? Humans are, after all, naturally omnivores. However, there is much research that indicates humans lived almost solely on plant matter as recently as 10,000 years ago. (Source 9 and 10) This isn't to say they were strict vegetarians, like the great apes, they very occasionally ate meat. However, it is likely that humans ate much less meat than they do today.Probably the hardest arguments about vegetarianism is health. Can you be healthy without eating meat? Well, apparently, vegetarians live on average 8 years longer than regular meat-eaters (this is comparable to the difference between smokers and non-smokers). (Source 11) The protein and vitamins of meat can be derived from vegetable sources, except without the cholesterol and fat. That's not to say that all vegetarians lead a healthy diet, if they replace meat with high-fat dairy, it does little good. But, on the whole, vegetarians live longer.ConclusionToday, we live in a society where it is possible (and beneficial) to choose a vegetarian diet. Perhaps in some parts of the world, eating meat may impact health or survival. But if you aren't in poverty, you don't need to sacrifice health to abstain from meat. Therefore, for us, eating meat is a choice of leisure, rather than need. A vegetarian diet greatly lessens our ecological impact and decreases the food we need to produce. A vegetarian diet undoubtedly lessens the hardship on animals as well as other human beings. I would call that more ethical.Nothing will benefit human health and increase chances for survival of life on Earth as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet. -- Albert Einstein. </t>

    <t>Ecological  You state, “1st water is a renuable resource and we shouldn't worry about whether or not it takes more water for a cow then wheat, because it is all going to be renewed and if we chose not to eat those cows they would consume more water to live longer. “  Believe it or not, water usage is a concern. Though fresh water is replenished by the water cycle we have a limited amount at a given time and it takes vast amounts of energy (non-sustainable) to treat the water. In 50 years, our population will increase by 3 billion people. It will become increasingly difficult to provide water for everyone. Also, you say that if we didn't eat the cows, they would consume the water anyway. The meat industry breeds these animals in MASSIVE quantities. They are forced to reproduce much more frequently than if they were wild. If we stopped breeding them for slaughter their numbers would decrease dramatically in a few years. Also, you did not consider that meat production not only takes the water the animals drink directly, but all the water it takes to grow the food they eat.  You state that if we all switch to eating plants, we would decrease the world plant population and thus decrease the oxygen on earth. Most of the plants farmers grow are fed to meat animals. If we switched to plant diets there would be more plants, and, according to you, more oxygen. About global warming, if you don't believe it is a concern, I'm not sure what to tell you. Animal Rights  You state: “Next I would like to say why animal rights shouldn't be a question. If you are an evolutionist you believe in survival of the fittest and that the better smarter species will weed out the lesser species, yes of course now days we try and keep a couple around but working against extinction of animals is very condridicting if your an evolutionist. “  Evolution is not a philosophy, it is a scientific concept. Survival of the fittest is not a code of conduct for life, it was never intended to be that. Evolution does not define morality.  Just because something behaves a certain way in nature does not make it ethical (e.g. causing other species' extinction).  97% of scientists accept evolution as scientific truth. This does not change what is ethical. I want to bring to attention that this is not a religious debate. It is a debate on ethics, which to some people does include religion, so I will address it briefly.   I am a protestant Christian and I think that evolution is probably true. I don't see a conflict between Christianity and evolution. God has the power to bring about life on earth in the way he chooses. I believe this way to be evolution. All the life on earth shares some percentage of DNA. This makes sense if you believe they come from the same Creator.  You mention that the Bible gives authority to man to rule over the creatures of the Earth. Does this mean we can do whatever we want to them? No, we must take care of them. Before the flood, God forbade the eating of meat. After the flood, he designated certain animals as “clean” to eat. Does this remove our responsibility to rule over the creatures with respect?  Here are some other things the bible has to say: 'The wolf and the lamb will feed together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox, but dust will be the serpent's food. They will neither hunt nor destroy on all my holy mountain,' says the LORD.” -Isaiah 65:25 “The godly care for their animals, but the wicked are always cruel. “ - Proverbs 12:10  “Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain. “ -Deuteronomy 25:4  “But ask the animals, and they will teach you, or ask the birds of the air, and they will tell you. Speak to the earth, and it will teach you, or let the fish of the sea tell you. Every one of these knows that the hand of the Lord has done this. The life of every creature and the breath of all people are in God’s hand.” -Job 12:7-10 (NCV)   Many early Christians were vegetarian, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, John Chrysostom, and Basil the Great to name a few. In some early church writings, Matthew, Peter and James (Brother of Jesus and first leader of the New Jerusalem Church) were all vegetarian. Clement wrote, 'It is far better to be happy than to have your bodies act as graveyards for animals. The Apostle Matthew partook of seeds, nuts and vegetables, without flesh'.   God giving us dominion over the animals does not give us license to mistreat them. God rules over us, and he is merciful to us. We rule over the creatures of the earth, should we not be merciful?    I do not think we should give rice plants rights. We only share 15% of our DNA with it. Plants have no brain, no central nervous system. There is no reason to think that plants have emotion or feel pain.There is a reason to think animals have emotion and feel pain. Animals are closer to us than plants, some animals are very close to us. Even bacteria share about 2% of our DNA. Does this give them rights? No. When you wash your hands, you kill thousands of bacteria. If you have ever felt pain, than you can surely understand why we should hesitate to inflict pain on the things that can feel it (animals, not plants and bacteria).  I agree with you about abortion. For the same reasons I think we should not kill animals, I feel we should not kill unborn humans. But this debate isn't about abortion.  Human Consumption  I'm not sure what you are saying about the health implications of a vegetarian diet. 8 years more of life is 8 years more of life. To me, that indicates it is healthy to be a vegetarian. Yes, there are many healthy, long-lived people who eat meat, but a diet without meat can be just as healthy (or possibly more-so). You conclude: “Eat meat there is nothing unethical about it.”  18,000 children die every day for lack of food. If the entire nation switched to a completely plant-based diet, there would be 5 times more protein food than the meat produced. We feed farm animals enough to feed 800,000,000 people every year. This world needs all the extra food it can get. “And it tastes darn good and just the fact that eating a nice steak can make a good day for someone that's proof enough for me that it's a good thing.“  Well, maybe punching my neighbor in the nose would “make a good day” for my neighbor's ex-wife, but that doesn't make it ethical.  Note: I apologize if my arguments seem a little strong, I'm just trying to present the situation as accurately as I can.</t>

    <t>Topic:A vegetarian diet is more ethical than a meat-eating diet. I'll take on the Pro position of the debate, meaning I'll argue for vegetarianism.Definitions:A vegetarian is someone who does not eat any meat or fish, but does not necessarily abstain from eating animal derivatives like eggs and milk.By 'ethical' I mean morally right (as opposed to wrong) conduct. This includes examining the issue from both ecological and animal rights standpoints, as well as the implications to us as humans.By a 'meat-eating' diet, we'll just assume the average U.S. consumer (rather than a strict organic meat-eating person). Rules:1. This first round is just for acceptance, please do not begin with your argument.2. Please cite your sources. Don't just say 'you can't survive without meat' unless you back it up with a reliable link. Also, it is best if you tell us why this source is credible.Well, that's pretty much it.

<h>Overpopulation is the root of many political conflicts and virtually all environmental problems. Aside from avoiding nuclear war, lowering the human population needs be set as a top priority. The limits of the human population are debatable, but the repercussions of having more then 7 billion humans inhabit the planet are not. One could argue that the issue at hand isn't the current population per se, but rather, it is the exponential growth of the human population that is a cause for concern. Data suggests that the world population grows by two percent each year. Some speculate that another two billion will be added to the world population by the year 2030. This rate of growth is far beyond reasonable. Overcrowding in poorer nations can cause countless immigrants to flee to many western nations as well. This is a large factor in the growth of richer nations as well. For example, the U.S. population will grow by over 100 million by year 2050. Either way, overpopulation has played the leading role throughout history in famine, warfare, political organization, political disorganization and arguably countless other social problems.  The conflicts that arise from overpopulation are often very obvious. For example, the spread of disease is magnified by a dense population; overcrowding invariably leads to territorial disputes; and in order for a society to maintain sustainable consumption rates of natural resources, higher populations require lower per-capita consumption rates. Problems such as climate change, pollution, and soil erosion can all be attributed to the fact that the number of humans far exceeds this planets capacity.  Logic would state that any given population should be able to survive solely off of their natural, immediate environment, and in the case that required resources or an abundant food supply is not readily available, the group may migrate, in the best interest of survival, to another region in order to meet their needs.  Possibly one of the largest contributing factors, however, is the overproduction of food. After the birth of agriculture, the ability to produce food outgrew the need, and the overabundance of it led to an intense population explosion. Overproduction of food allows for more people to be born and, therefore, allows for a greater population. Human population growth is a rapidly cycling positive feedback loop in which food availability drives population growth. Some suggest that advancement in medical science is the greatest influence over the population. Medical science and technology greatly affect the mean life expectancy, but play a small part in the population equation.  No matter what the definitive cause, the Earth simply cannot sustain more then 7 billion humans. If humans are to survive on this planet, we need to drastically begin to reduce our population. Coupled with conservation efforts and the spread of environmental awareness, we might stand a chance, but overpopulation is nothing short of a crisis, and needs to be addressed with urgency.</h>

    <t>Thank you for bringing up the “humane” options for meat. I think these are definitely better for the animals involved. As long as the animals are treated as well as they say and they are killed swiftly, I think it is just as ethical as a vegetarian diet. I really hope more people do get into that.  :D Before I close, I must address the seeming inconsistency in my position. The resolution of the debate is “A vegetarian diet is more ethical than a meat-eating diet.” I define “meat-eating” in the rules of the first-round. Let me quote myself from the first round of the debate:   “By a 'meat-eating' diet, we'll just assume the average U.S. consumer (rather than a strict organic meat-eating person).“   To determine whether it is ethical to eat meat, we must look at what people TYPICALLY do, not what people CAN do. People can choose organic or “ethical” meat, but the truth is that 99% of the meat we eat in America (and most developed countries) is factory-farmed. As I stated in the first round, my argument is for the “average U.S. consumer” not the oddball 1% that choose ethically raised meat.   Ethically raising animals takes more land. It would be impossible to set aside enough land to pasture-raise animals in order to feed us. To provide everyone animal products at the rate we consume, we have to confine livestock animals into small cages and make there lives unusually short. Some fifty-five billion land animals are raised and slaughtered each year world wide for agriculture. That's about 8 times the global human population, each year. Animal production occupies 80 percent of the Earth’s total usable arable land. Would it be possible to farm all of these animals with enough space to allow free movement? Would it be possible to let them live longer and still produce the same amount of meat overall? No. It wouldn't be possible. That is why only 1% of the meat we eat is not factory-farmed.   So, organic or “humane” meat is better for the animals involved, which is definitely good, but it is not necessarily better for the people. Pasture-raising animals provides just as much strain on the environment as factory-farming the animals. Also, pasture-raising animals takes more land and time to produce the same amount of animals, meaning less food.   I'm not arguing for factory-farms, there are definite benefits to moving away from that type of farming. However, not everyone could eat pasture-raised meat for lack of land. Luckily, there is another option. A vegetarian diet takes far less land and produces more food than an organic or non-organic meat based diet.   However, you don't have to completely avoid meat to reduce ecological strain, increase the world food supply, and decrease animal suffering. More people eating less meat can have the similar effect; this too is more ethical than eating excessive meat.   Conclusion  As more countries become developed, the issue continues to grow. The Telegraph reports, “China now eats twice as much meat as the United States and must rein in its appetite or face a food crisis, one of the country's leading farm experts has warned.“ The average Chinese person eats around 52 kg of meat yearly while the average American eats 124 kg. Some experts predict that within 40 years time, we may all have to switch to a vegetarian diet to avoid catastrophic water shortages. In addition, it has been determined that a diet of meat is not necessary for survival or health, at least for those in developed nations. The American Dietetic Association states:    'Vegetarian diets offer a number of nutritional benefits, including lower levels of saturated fat, cholesterol, and animal protein, as well as higher levels of carbohydrates, fiber, magnesium, potassium, folate, and antioxidants such as vitamins C and E and phytochemicals. Vegetarians have been reported to have lower body mass indices than nonvegetarians, as well as lower rates of death from ischemic heart disease; vegetarians also show lower blood cholesterol levels; lower blood pressure; and lower rates of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and prostate and colon cancer.'    Source: American Dietetic Association. (2003). Position paper on vegetarian diets. J Am Diet Assoc, 103, 748-765.    For those in developed nations such as America, eating meat is a leisure. It is not necessary for survival or health, and there is much research that indicates too much meat can harm a person. It takes on average 41 grams of plant protein to produce 7 grams of animals protein (not to mention the extra water and energy used). The 7 billion livestock animals in the US eat 5 times the grain the entire human population eats.    Eating meat is less ethical than a vegetarian diet because:     Meat production strains the environment far more than plant production, partly because animals eat the majority of crops we grow. Also, animal production produces more greenhouse gases than all transportation of any kind combined.   Meat production wastes food that could be fed to humans. It is like taking the food, and throwing 83% of it into the trash. 18,000 children die every day of starvation. We need more food.   Modern cost-driven meat production causes mass suffering of animals. 55,000,000,000 farm animals are killed yearly. 99% of those in America (around 7 billion animals) are bred, raised, and killed on a factory farm.      If eating meat was necessary for health or survival, these three results listed above MIGHT be justifiable. It is pretty shaky though. But it has been proven that meat is not necessary for health or survival, at least for those in developed countries.  I'm not trying to say eating meat is completely unethical. It certainly has a place our culture and our history. It used to be necessary for survival. But today it isn't. This makes eating meat in a developed country LESS ethical than not eating meat. A vegetarian diet has potential to improve conditions for animals, but more importantly it can improve the lives of the people of the world.     I want to thank you for participating, Locke33. You've brought to my attention some new issues and interesting ideas. You've been patient and a great opponent.</t>

    <t>No need for apologies. I hear you, school absolutely does suck. I'm glad we can find some common ground though.   Let me clarify my position a little. Personally, I don't think eating animal flesh is wrong in itself. I think if a person doesn't cause an animal pain before slaughter, kills it swiftly, and this action doesn't hurt any other person, there is nothing unethical about the consumption of the meat. I see 3 problems with the ethics of eating meat:     Factory farming causes great pain for the entire life of the animals involved. 99% of the animals we eat are raised and slaughtered on a factory farm.   Meat production in mass quantities causes ecological problems. Three-quarters of the world's agricultural land is devoted to raising livestock, either for grazing or for growing feed.   Meat production causes us to have less food. Meat returns a fraction of the food we put into it. A study in 2011 found that if we ate less meat, the world food supply could double.     On the health issue, this isn't directly related to ethics. What I'm saying about health is that a person (in a rich country at least) can be JUST as healthy without eating meat. So, eating meat is a preference rather than a necessity. I do agree that more tests need to be conducted about a balanced meat and vegetable diet, rather than extremes.   You mention people in poor countries who rely on meat for survival, such as Eskimos and tribes in Africa. These people are not the worst offenders. If they continued their practices, we'd be fine. They can't afford factory-farmed meat and they don't produce animals an a massive scale. What they do is NOT unethical.   But the reality is that the poor don't consume or produce much meat in comparison to rich countries. Over 80% of meat eaten in the world is consumed by people in the richest half of world countries. We in rich countries are the main offenders. The average American eats around 280 lbs of meat per year (more than recommended for health), the average person from Sierra Leone or the Republic of Congo eats only 10 lbs of meat. Why should Americans eat more meat than recommended while people from other countries have little food at all? It is the excess of rich countries like America that is unethical, not the small tribes of the world.   Let's address the issue of eating plants, which sometimes share 15% of our DNA. Who says we shouldn't discriminate between different forms of life when choosing what to eat? After all, we must eat something that is alive. Everything that is alive shares some of our DNA. If we didn't discriminate between different forms of life, we would starve.   Let's look at it this way. Humans share 99% of there DNA between each other, humans are obviously not ethical to eat. Bacteria shares around 2% DNA with us, we kill and eat bacteria constantly, every day. But that's OK, because it is unavoidable and bacteria doesn't feel pain. A plant shares a little more DNA with us, around 15%. They are not much more like us than bacteria, plants also don't feel pain. However, a cow shares more than 5 times the DNA with us than a rice plant, 80% similar to ours. It is proven that cows feel pain.   Isaiah 1:11-17 (NIV) 11 “The multitude of your sacrifices—what are they to me?” says the Lord. “I have more than enough of burnt offerings,of rams and the fat of fattened animals; I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats. 12 When you come to appear before me, who has asked this of you, this trampling of my courts? 13 Stop bringing meaningless offerings! Your incense is detestable to me. New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations— I cannot bear your worthless assemblies. 14 Your New Moon feasts and your appointed festivals I hate with all my being. They have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them. 15 When you spread out your hands in prayer, I hide my eyes from you; even when you offer many prayers, I am not listening. Your hands are full of blood! 16 Wash and make yourselves clean. Take your evil deeds out of my sight; stop doing wrong. 17 Learn to do right; seek justice. Defend the oppressed. Take up the cause of the fatherless; plead the case of the widow.”  God may have called for sacrifices of animals at one time, but it was always more important to “defend the oppressed.” After the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, animal sacrifices became obsolete. This matches the message of compassion Jesus brought.   Excuse me, but I don't understand how I did not refute the statement that if we all ate plants only, we'd have an oxygen shortage. Less plants are killed by a vegetarian diet than a meat diet. This is a fact, it is not disputable. It takes 41 tons of plant protein to produce 7 pounds of animal protein. Most of the plants we grow are fed to animals, who inefficiently convert it to animal protein, losing 83% of the protein in the process. 3/4 of the world's agricultural land is used for livestock production, which provides less food for us than plants. Again, I don't think eating meat is unethical in itself. Two-hundred years ago, I don't think it was unethical at all.

    <t>First I will start with quoting what my opponent said in the start of the last round, 'Let me clarify my position a little. Personally, I don't think eating animal flesh is wrong in itself. I think if a person doesn't cause an animal pain before slaughter, kills it swiftly, and this action doesn't hurt any other person, there is nothing unethical about the consumption of the meat.  You can get meat this way today it costs more money but you can. Since you said there is nothing wrong ethically with eating meat, there really is no argument. Something can't be more ethical then something else if it is completely ethical. Here is some proof of humane meat out there this is one of many, 'Wouldn't it be great if farm animals were raised compassionately? Well, some people are way ahead of you on that. Whole Foods Markets has decided to come up with standards to create a line of meats bearing an 'animal compassionate' label, meaning farmers raised the animals humanely. It's not the first animal-welfare label out there. There's also the 'certified humane' label administered by Humane Farm Animal Care, and the 'free farmed' label overseen by the American Humane Association. And the Animal Welfare Institute issues the label 'Animal Welfare Approved.'  All aim for humane lives for farm animals, though each program is different. Examples: The New York Times pointed out that the Animal Welfare Institute and the 'free farmed' label let pigs have nose rings to prevent them from tearing up the ground when they root around, but the other programs forbid rings. At AnimalWelfareApproved.org, the Animal Welfare Institute posts a comparison chart showing how it's the most favorable program.  The nonprofit watchdog group Consumers Union so far has examined only the 'certified humane' label, which it deemed a 'highly meaningful label that indicates that meat, dairy and egg products came from animals that were treated humanely,' according to its eco-oriented web site, Eco-labels.org. The 'certified humane' label has several requirements. Among examples: Livestock must have access to clean and sufficient food and water; they must have sufficient room to move naturally; and their environment must not endanger their health.  In the end, the vast majority of livestock don't fall under any of these humane-labeling programs, and you may achieve your goal of buying humanely raised meats via other routes -- by buying from farmers markets or small local farms. Another way: Quiz local co-ops about what they know about how their meats were produced.  For more info:  To find out where to buy 'Certified Humane' foods, go to CertifiedHumane.com. To find Animal Welfare-approved foods, go to www.AnimalWelfareApproved.org. To find 'Free Farmed' producers, go to AmericanHumane.org.'(1)  So I really have nothing else to say as long as you get humanly raised meat like up above me and my opponent both agree eating meat is completely ethical and since eating a vegetarian diet is completely ethical, they are both equally ethical and that's the debate.  So basically whenever you eat meat make sure you get humanly raised and slaughtered meat and then you will be eating just as ethically as a vegetarian in both mine and my opponents eyes.  Good luck with your closing statement in the last round remember no rebuttals or new arguments, like we agreed. Lets end this.</t>

    <t>1st no need to opologise we share some of the same beliefs like evolution in creation. I believe based on proof that micro evolution is an important part of what goes on in the earth. That is the only proven part of evolution. But that's for another debate.  Many more people in foreign third world country's would go hungry with out the ability to eat meat. How bout the Eskimos or Inuits meat is a vital food source in a place that's unforgiving, what about tribes in Africa even more of there kids would be go hungry without meat, especially in the small untouched tribes.  We still need to test a balanced diet of meat and vegetables against a all veggie diet to conclude that no meat is healthier.  If we should not kill a living thing because it is 85 percent human then why should we be able to kill one that is only 15 that's a little bit discriminating if we are going to go to the point of 85 percent human DNA means a animal is a sentient bien.  Yes we should rule over them with care not slaughtering them, but why would God require living animals as sacrifices if they were sentient. And Isaiah 65:25 is a prophesy of the 1000 year reign when animals will live together in peace and there will be no wars. But that again is another debate I will save escatology for later. :)  I never said evolution was a guidelines of life but why would anyone who believes in it want to mess with the natural cycle of the earth.  Yes we do breed lots more cows now but they would eventually get way larger in population then now and consume just as much water just like our population continues to increase.  And you didn't really rebute my plant oxygen argument.  My apologies for the hasty sound of this round this is a last minute debate on the last hour off the top of my head.  Bed times in 10 minutes.

    <t>Overpopulation is the root of many political conflicts and virtually all environmental problems. Aside from avoiding nuclear war, lowering the human population needs be set as a top priority. The limits of the human population are debatable, but the repercussions of having more then 7 billion humans inhabit the planet are not. One could argue that the issue at hand isn't the current population per se, but rather, it is the exponential growth of the human population that is a cause for concern. Data suggests that the world population grows by two percent each year. Some speculate that another two billion will be added to the world population by the year 2030. This rate of growth is far beyond reasonable. Overcrowding in poorer nations can cause countless immigrants to flee to many western nations as well. This is a large factor in the growth of richer nations as well. For example, the U.S. population will grow by over 100 million by year 2050. Either way, overpopulation has played the leading role throughout history in famine, warfare, political organization, political disorganization and arguably countless other social problems.  The conflicts that arise from overpopulation are often very obvious. For example, the spread of disease is magnified by a dense population; overcrowding invariably leads to territorial disputes; and in order for a society to maintain sustainable consumption rates of natural resources, higher populations require lower per-capita consumption rates. Problems such as climate change, pollution, and soil erosion can all be attributed to the fact that the number of humans far exceeds this planets capacity.  Logic would state that any given population should be able to survive solely off of their natural, immediate environment, and in the case that required resources or an abundant food supply is not readily available, the group may migrate, in the best interest of survival, to another region in order to meet their needs.  Possibly one of the largest contributing factors, however, is the overproduction of food. After the birth of agriculture, the ability to produce food outgrew the need, and the overabundance of it led to an intense population explosion. Overproduction of food allows for more people to be born and, therefore, allows for a greater population. Human population growth is a rapidly cycling positive feedback loop in which food availability drives population growth. Some suggest that advancement in medical science is the greatest influence over the population. Medical science and technology greatly affect the mean life expectancy, but play a small part in the population equation.  No matter what the definitive cause, the Earth simply cannot sustain more then 7 billion humans. If humans are to survive on this planet, we need to drastically begin to reduce our population. Coupled with conservation efforts and the spread of environmental awareness, we might stand a chance, but overpopulation is nothing short of a crisis, and needs to be addressed with urgency.</t>

    <t>You are simply wrong.  Again, our population increase is slowing down greatly. There is not a single country on earth who's fertility rate is is larger today than in 1960. Everywhere (except in Khazakstan) fertility rates are falling, and they keep falling faster and faster, and they will fall below the replacement rate. Currently in half the world fertility rates are below the replacement rate.  The pattern is this: mortality falls, causing a population boom, then a few decades later fecundity falls suddenly and rapidly.  The UN's best estimate is that the world population will start falling after reaching a peak at 9.2 billion people in 2075.  And again, there is plenty of food. At 7 billion people we keep eating better and better every decade and agricultural production keeps going up and up, and will continue to do so thanks to (among other things) GM crops, better irrigation methods, etc, as I described in post 1. Food is not a problem in the least.  We won't destroy forests for housing. There is no need to. The world population will become more urbanized, requiring less and less space per person as people move into dense cities and live in multistory apartments.  The world is not becoming polluted either. There have been various scares in the past such as predictions that by 1985 you would need a gas mask to live in the USA and Rachel Carson's prediction of a cancer epidemic caused by chemicals. It is total nonsense. The quality of air in western countries is better than it has been since the beginning of the industrial revolution and is continuing to get better. The same goes for water. Our waste management (filters for cars, water purification, etc) is better than ever and keeps getting better. Preventing pollution is largely a simple matter of lawmaking. Do not panic, the sky is not falling.  Fresh water is abundantly available to everyone not living in extreme poverty in deserts. There is no impending catastrophe of water wars, or whatever. Water isn't destroyed: the water you flush down your toilet is purified and can be used again. Our drinking water is purer than ever. Water comes from the sky and from underground and it can be made by purifying salt water. In fact, global warming on average will cause more rain. This means more fresh water. The warmth and water also means more arable farm land and more food.  Everything you said stems from completely irrational pessimism and your gut feel on how things will go. Your view doesn't take in to account any actual evidence on the subjects and you see no possible change in sight. If something can't keep on going forever, it won't.</t>

    <t>I urge you to read 'The Rational Optimist' by Matt Ridley, where he goes into ALL of these issues in wonderful depth.  I will try to keep this short because I have to wake up in 6 hours.  The population will not go on increasing as the world becomes healthier. Indeed as you know, in many western countries the fertility rate is so low that the populations are decreasing. Where the fertility rate is high and rising, it is rising slower all the time. If I remember correctly, he argues that the world population will not go much above 10 billion.  Sufficient food can be made with continuing agricultural advancement. This involves GM crops, urbanization, proper methods of irrigation (water pipes under the soil, already in use), fertilization etc. Arable surface area can be increased with things such as multistory fields, etc.  The fears related to global warming are greatly exaggerated and the effects occur slowly, they are easy to adapt to and easy to manage in fact global warming will increase the amount of arable land. Global warming can conceivably even be reversed given the right engineering solutions.  There is less war, conflicts and violence than ever before and the world is becoming more peaceful continuously. Trade between nations is an engine for peace, prosperity and progress.  The problem of diminishing natural resources (oil, coal) is greatly exaggerated, with more and more oil and coal being found all the time. Also historically there has been a trend of 'peak ' crises which have never come true (e.g. fears in the 19th century that coal would run out). People will start using other energy sources than fossil fuels.  The planet can easily sustain much more than 7 billion people, no sweat.  About predictions: global famine fear mongering has been going on forever, with books like Famine, 1975! and The Population Bomb. For example early editions of the latter book by Paul Ehrlich he promised (in the 70s) this: 'Hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash program embarked upon now. At this late date nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate...'  People seem to be in a sense hardwired to be pessimistic about the future regardless of the evidence or past experience. They look at the way things are going now and extrapolate to the future assuming things won't change, just as The Times of London estimated in 1894 that there would be 9 feet of horse dung on every street of London by 1950. I think you are doing exactly this.</t>

    <t>Too much of anything is bad, no matter what the argument is. Big is better if it is contained. More is better if there is control. Anything that is excessive is definitely destructive. Overpopulation is one of them.  For the animal kingdom, a large number of members in a group are an advantage when you talk about dominance of the area. There will be more members who will defend and stay guard to protect their territory and their group. On the other hand, a large group of animals will be in a disadvantage when it comes to feeding their group for they must hunt and kill more than other groups who are on an average number.  The same goes with the human race. An overpopulated community needs a lot of supply of basic necessities to support their existence. Basic needs like clean water, staple food, shelter and clothing are now posing a problem for some parts of the world. Lack of basic needs leads to starvation, chaos and deaths.  Our planet earth has limited resources and there will come a time when the whole world will be overpopulated and will need to ration all meager resources just to provide for the peoples existence.  For now, the situation is not yet overwhelming but the signs are already here for the past decade or so. We have the phenomenon of El Ni'o and La Ni'a, Global warming and famine on some parts of the world. These are the effects of overpopulation of humans. We are producing products which we need for our daily activities and this are done by factories and plants that emits dangerous chemicals, toxic wastes and some other forms of hazardous materials which contributes to the degradation of our planet.  Overpopulation is a world issue. This is threatening not only our planet and our lives but also our race and all the things here on earth. There should be a concrete plan to arrive at a concrete solution for this problem. Otherwise, we may start to count the time for our planet. Many people are now considering other planets or moons where the human race will start a new life and make a new earth. In any way, even if that dream will become a reality one thing is for sure. Humans will still overpopulate any place wherever our race will go.  Is overpopulation a world threat? Yes, it is a world threat.</t>

I predict that by 2050 our population will be so large that there will be no more habitat for animals, the world will be so polluted it will almost be inhabitable, food will become scarce and there won't be enough fresh water to survive.

Factories do not generally pollute in the western world. - More and more environmental regulation coming all the time. - Everyone is eating better every decade, and will continue to do so. No impending famine. - The world GDP is going up, everyone is getting richer and healthier. - It is easy to adapt to global warming. It will mean more arable land and rain = more food.</t>

<h>I would like to thank my opponent’s response.   Rebuttals:   1. First, consensus is irrelevant to science. Galileo opposed consensus, Einstein opposed consensus. As Einstein noted, it only took one person, one paper, to disprove his theory. Further, getting a mere list actually does not represent the opinion of climate scientists. Other scientists are irrelevant (except geologists and meteorologists). The majority of debate only happens in political literature, not scientific literature. There is actually a consensus in favor of global warming. No major scientific organization opposes man-made global warming. 97% of climate scientists say global warming is man-made. Although this point is mainly irrelevant, the opposite of my opponents argument is true [1]. 2. Long term trends cannot be decided in 15 years. Richard Muller, former skeptic, website notes, “Some people draw a line segment covering the period 1998 to 2010 and argue that we confirm no temperature change in that period. However, if you did that same exercise back in 1995, and drew a horizontal line through the data for 1980 to 1995, you might have falsely concluded that global warming had stopped back then. This exercise simply shows that the decadal fluctuations are too large to allow us to make decisive conclusions about long term trends based on close examination of periods as short as 13 to 15 years.”[2] Many temperature datasets do not include the Arctic where it has been warming. Studies accounting for many factors, such as the 1998 El Nino, and others, conclude the earth is still warming at the same rate it was in the 1990s [3]. 3. Stopping global warming and its effects on the economy are irrelevant to what causes the warmth. This is totally irrelevant in this debate.   Case 1. Many studies indicate the overall human impact on global warming is far greater than the natural impact, interestingly many natural impacts are having a cooling effect on the warming. Teet et al. 2000 finds human activity caused over 100% of the warming from 1940 – 1997. How do you get 100%? Natural forcing’s causing a cooling effect, meaning we reversed those factors and caused warming. Meehl et al. 2004 finds humans caused 80% of the warming in the last century. Stone et al. 2007 found we caused almost 100% of the warming in the last 60 years. In a second paper, he noted humans caused 50% of the warming, the other half displaced by areosols, and the sun and volcanoes were responsible for 13 and 37% of the warming. Lean and Rind 2008 finds humans have caused 80% of the modern warming. Sott et al. used the same approach of Lean and Rind, but finds humans have caused 86% of the global warming. Huber and Knutti 2011 finds humans have caused 75-100% of the modern global warming. Foster and Rhmstorf 2011 finds that humans have caused 100% of the warming in the last 60 years. Gillet et al. 2012 finds we caused over 100% of the modern warming, as it had to overstep cooling effects and cause warming, making it over 100% [4]. 2. The sun, what my opponent argues causes global warming, is not the cause of modern warming. Sun Spots, overall, have no trend proving they likely do not cause the modern warming phase. The current sun spot number is like it was in 1913, when it was very cold, unlike this year, again showing the sun- not a candidate for modern warming [5]. 3. Scientific bodies have ruled out natural factors, man-made theory is the only possible thing left. Conclusion: Humans are the cause of global warming. </h>

    <t>Thank you, it was a pleasure :)</t>
<h>Thank you Pro for accepting this debate.  I believe global warming is not real and any temperature change is caused by the sun. I have three main points to back my argument.  1. People believe in global warming because political figures do 2. The earth is cooling 3. 'Global Warming' hurts jobs  1. My sources say that the majority of scientists studying climate change will say that global warming is not true. About 17,000 scientists agree with the fact that it is not true. How can we possibly agree with something that is not proven by fact? The reason people believe that global warming is true is because major political figures believe it and say it is true. Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Al Gore, and many others are examples of my point. The fact is people believe this because people they trust believe, not because of fact.  2. In the last ten years the earth has gone from warming to cooling. The global temperatures are expected to decline for the next two decades. This does not need very much arguing because it is backed by pure fact.  3. If we continue to believe global warming as a society, we will lose millions of jobs and be less energy efficient. If we cannot use oil, cannot use coal, and cannot use nuclear power, how do you expect any country to be energy efficient? You can't. Without these ways of producing energy, America will lose jobs and we will be forced to find new methods of energy which will cost billions.

    <t>So true</t>
<h>Refutations:  1. You just countered your own argument. You said that the number of scientists does not matter yet you argue that because more scientists agree with global warming it is true. In fact more scientists actually agree with me, your source is not reliable. You also dodged the majority of my argument. My point was people believe what political figures tell them to. My argument was not pure fact like yours.....  2. Just because I said it is PREDICTED that the earth would continue cooling does not mean that was my entire argument. Yes I did say that, but people that believe in global warming say the earth will continue getting 'warmer' It is called argument anticipation. My main argument was that the earth is getting colder by temperature change that we have observed and experienced. You dodged most of my argument because you cannot argue with fact.  3. If we continue to believe in global warming then we will lose jobs. I think that the effects of the belief would go with the debate so I would say you dodged this argument as well.  To counter your case I will say that I can get a bunch of sources to back my opinion too but that does not make a case, or a debate. You should get some actual arguments instead of plain sources because that is not what debating is. You use sources to back your arguments not the other way around.  As my main points were either halfway refuted or ignored completely, I will not be providing new points and I ask voters to give arguments to me for a poor case on pro.</h>

    <t>Rebuttals:  1. My opponent claims I have 'contradicted' myself. This is untrue. I argued consensus was irrelevant, however according to my opponents reasoning he loses the point because the majority of climate specialists and scientific organizations support my position. If I said consensus is always wrong, my point would be defeated. However disproving your point then arguing its irrelevancy isn't really a contradiction. It's merely extra information. Pointing out that 1) you are wrong and b) the point is irrelevant anyway weakens your point even further. My opponent then claims 'more scientists' agree with him. Problem with numbers much? A list of names and a poll are two different things. Take the whitehouse petition. One petition, which has 32,000 signatures, argues Senator Feinstein should be impeached... because she supports an assault weapons ban [1]. However, 58% of the public supports such a ban [2]. A list of scientists and a massive scientific survey are different things. Surveys are more accurate as they include all groups of the population they are polling, lists merely show one opinion (not the other, one sided analysis) making it unreliable. And again, as stated, the vast majority of the signers are not specialists in climate, making the list irrelevant. My data stands on the issue showing a vast consensus from climate experts. Whether my argument, consensus is irrelevant, or my opponents, its the be all and end all, I win this point as I have shown consensus on my side (or) the irrelevancy of the point.  2. Strawman by my opponent. I did not refute his predictions, I merely pointed out the data the predictions are based on is bogus. The predictions are based on the claims of current cooling. I rebutted in two ways: First, I noted a small trend out of a longterm trend is irrelevant showing the same could have been done in earlier decades however the long term trend is up. Secondly, I noted he world isn't cooling at all, nor is it flat-lining. I showed the rate of warming is the same as in earlier decades (1990s, when the warming was exceptional). My opponents argument:  'In the last ten years the earth has gone from warming to cooling. The global temperatures are expected to decline for the next two decades. This does not need very much arguing because it is backed by pure fact.'  I did not jump the gun on anything. I noted the first part of this, the earth is cooling currently, was false. That is based on the 1998 el Nino artificially changing the trend, and when this is accounted for the earth is still warming. If the first part is wrong, the following assumptions have no evidence behind them. Therefore, my opponent has decided to dodge my rebuttal instead to strawman the point: claim I only argued predictions. will reiterate my point: 'Studies accounting for many factors, such as the 1998 El Nino, and others, conclude the earth is still warming at the same rate it was in the 1990s.' I showed it is still currently warming, I did not focus on any prediction whatsoever. My opponent claims I am dodging the point, which is false, and mostly is a cop-out argument. Anyone who cared to read round two can see that this is false.  3. I didn't dodge anything, this is a pure red herring. I didn't think I would have to use semantics for an obvious point. Lets do this like a first grade teacher so we can all get this.  Class, what is the resolution? Humans cause Global warming Mr. Adams. Good. Does the economics of preventing global warming relate to the cause of global warming. No.  The economics of preventing global warming is irrelevant to what causes it. Let's use a probably poor analogy but its all I can think of: what causes the battery on my laptop to die? Usage of the device. To fix it, I must charge it. But wait, its bad to charge it because I have to walk!!! (I am not saying you are wrong by making a bad analogy on the costs of charging, by the way). But does the cost of charging it relate to what is causing it? No, not at all. What is causing the problem is an independent variable to the costs of fixing the problem. Many people support the global warming theory because the facts support it, but oppose mitigation due to its effects on the economy. The fix is irrelevant to the cause, and if you read the resolution the cause is what the debate is about. The point is irrelevant. I am not dodging anything, you are landing an argument where its easier for you to argue but is irrelevant to give the illusion you have one (one) of the points made in the debate. Its a red herring.  DEFENDING MY CASE  1. My opponent merely argues I have source spammed. Although I usually do, this isn't really source spam. I gave data points and observations from multiple studies showing humans are the cause of global warming. When you present data, is is courteous to cite the source. Source spam would be this.  'Global warming is natural' No, its not. Link times 100  I cited the data and the observations in the study. If my opponent wants, I can provide the methodology next round or in a PM so he can ridicule the results. Presenting a study, its results, and, if needed, a short explanation is not source spam. The argument is simple:  1. We emit greenhouse gases (we agree upon this). 2. Natural factors likely don't cause the current warming (we disagree here). 3. Man-made factors explain the modern warming (we disagree here). 4. Therefore, warming is man-made (obviously we disagree on the conclusion).  For 2, I showed the sun had no correlation with temperature since the 1980's and said '. Sun Spots, overall, have no trend proving they likely do not cause the modern warming phase. The current sun spot number is like it was in 1913, when it was very cold, unlike this year, again showing the sun- not a candidate for modern warming'  Yeah, providing data and a lack correlation is such a weak argument...  For three, I provided data points based on multiple regression analysis which happens to be done by many academic studies showing man likely has caused the modern warming.  My opponent merely drops my case with no ounce of rebuttal, it's like he is not even trying. I could expand on my argument, with more data and observations. Actually I will, let's hope this isn't spamming.  My argument was he majority of data supports my position. I provided data. Instead of refuting it, my opponent ignores it with the cop-out argument of source spam. I showed co2 caused the current warm phase. Let's take another route.  CO2 causes the current warming, as shown by many points of evidence. CO2 causes warming, as many measurements have shown. CO2 is a greenhouse gas. When more CO2 and methane are added to containers, the amount of outgoing radiation decreases, providing evidence of the CO2 warming effect. The amount of outgoing radiation is falling as temperatures increase, indicating a strong correlation between CO2 and temperature. These data points have been shown by surface and satellite temperature datasets. CO2 has caused the earths energy imbalance causing the modern warm period of man made origin [3]. I am low on room, so that is all I can say. Data backing up my assertions can be found here. And last round, but thats somehow spam. ====== Am I really dodging arguments?

    <t>I would like to thank my opponent’s response.   Rebuttals:   1. First, consensus is irrelevant to science. Galileo opposed consensus, Einstein opposed consensus. As Einstein noted, it only took one person, one paper, to disprove his theory. Further, getting a mere list actually does not represent the opinion of climate scientists. Other scientists are irrelevant (except geologists and meteorologists). The majority of debate only happens in political literature, not scientific literature. There is actually a consensus in favor of global warming. No major scientific organization opposes man-made global warming. 97% of climate scientists say global warming is man-made. Although this point is mainly irrelevant, the opposite of my opponents argument is true [1]. 2. Long term trends cannot be decided in 15 years. Richard Muller, former skeptic, website notes, “Some people draw a line segment covering the period 1998 to 2010 and argue that we confirm no temperature change in that period. However, if you did that same exercise back in 1995, and drew a horizontal line through the data for 1980 to 1995, you might have falsely concluded that global warming had stopped back then. This exercise simply shows that the decadal fluctuations are too large to allow us to make decisive conclusions about long term trends based on close examination of periods as short as 13 to 15 years.”[2] Many temperature datasets do not include the Arctic where it has been warming. Studies accounting for many factors, such as the 1998 El Nino, and others, conclude the earth is still warming at the same rate it was in the 1990s [3]. 3. Stopping global warming and its effects on the economy are irrelevant to what causes the warmth. This is totally irrelevant in this debate.   Case 1. Many studies indicate the overall human impact on global warming is far greater than the natural impact, interestingly many natural impacts are having a cooling effect on the warming. Teet et al. 2000 finds human activity caused over 100% of the warming from 1940 – 1997. How do you get 100%? Natural forcing’s causing a cooling effect, meaning we reversed those factors and caused warming. Meehl et al. 2004 finds humans caused 80% of the warming in the last century. Stone et al. 2007 found we caused almost 100% of the warming in the last 60 years. In a second paper, he noted humans caused 50% of the warming, the other half displaced by areosols, and the sun and volcanoes were responsible for 13 and 37% of the warming. Lean and Rind 2008 finds humans have caused 80% of the modern warming. Sott et al. used the same approach of Lean and Rind, but finds humans have caused 86% of the global warming. Huber and Knutti 2011 finds humans have caused 75-100% of the modern global warming. Foster and Rhmstorf 2011 finds that humans have caused 100% of the warming in the last 60 years. Gillet et al. 2012 finds we caused over 100% of the modern warming, as it had to overstep cooling effects and cause warming, making it over 100% [4]. 2. The sun, what my opponent argues causes global warming, is not the cause of modern warming. Sun Spots, overall, have no trend proving they likely do not cause the modern warming phase. The current sun spot number is like it was in 1913, when it was very cold, unlike this year, again showing the sun- not a candidate for modern warming [5]. 3. Scientific bodies have ruled out natural factors, man-made theory is the only possible thing left. Conclusion: Humans are the cause of global warming. </t>

    <t>Thank you Pro for accepting this debate.  I believe global warming is not real and any temperature change is caused by the sun. I have three main points to back my argument.  1. People believe in global warming because political figures do 2. The earth is cooling 3. 'Global Warming' hurts jobs  1. My sources say that the majority of scientists studying climate change will say that global warming is not true. About 17,000 scientists agree with the fact that it is not true. How can we possibly agree with something that is not proven by fact? The reason people believe that global warming is true is because major political figures believe it and say it is true. Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, Al Gore, and many others are examples of my point. The fact is people believe this because people they trust believe, not because of fact.  2. In the last ten years the earth has gone from warming to cooling. The global temperatures are expected to decline for the next two decades. This does not need very much arguing because it is backed by pure fact.  3. If we continue to believe global warming as a society, we will lose millions of jobs and be less energy efficient. If we cannot use oil, cannot use coal, and cannot use nuclear power, how do you expect any country to be energy efficient? You can't. Without these ways of producing energy, America will lose jobs and we will be forced to find new methods of energy which will cost billions.  I believe I have proved my points and I await pro's case.</t>

    <t>Refutations:  1. You just countered your own argument. You said that the number of scientists does not matter yet you argue that because more scientists agree with global warming it is true. In fact more scientists actually agree with me, your source is not reliable. You also dodged the majority of my argument. My point was people believe what political figures tell them to. My argument was not pure fact like yours.....  2. Just because I said it is PREDICTED that the earth would continue cooling does not mean that was my entire argument. Yes I did say that, but people that believe in global warming say the earth will continue getting 'warmer' It is called argument anticipation. My main argument was that the earth is getting colder by temperature change that we have observed and experienced. You dodged most of my argument because you cannot argue with fact.  3. If we continue to believe in global warming then we will lose jobs. I think that the effects of the belief would go with the debate so I would say you dodged this argument as well.  To counter your case I will say that I can get a bunch of sources to back my opinion too but that does not make a case, or a debate. You should get some actual arguments instead of plain sources because that is not what debating is. You use sources to back your arguments not the other way around.

    <t>Do you think global warming is cause by the greenhouse effect?</t>
<h>My opponent has argued that the moderate to poor correlation of CO2 is enough to be considered major, however this is illogical. First, I never said CO2 had no effect, I argued it was not the main cause. Second, it is unlikely increasing CO2 has a large impact because CO2 increases are logarithmic, in other words the more CO2 there is the less warming effect each unit has. If we double the amount of CO2 from pre-industrial levels (we have gone through 30-50% increase) then warming per I increase would be extremely small. A 20 ppm increase of CO2 would be much less then 0.2 degrees Celsius [1]. Second, the climate is not very sensitive; a better way to put it would be an increase in CO2 would have little effect. The evidence claiming climate to be sensitive are very flawed, they ignore climate feedbacks and other factors relating to sensitivity. If CO2 were to double, only a 1 degree increase would occur, we have not doubled CO2 levels from the pre-industrial era and have warmed less then one degree Celsius. With current emissions it is unlikely we could argue CO2 is the main driver of climate change, when sensitivity is taken into account [2].  Second, my opponents rebuttal to the PDO and AMO argues the correlation is due to the seas space, however he ignores the fact the PDO and AMO go into cooling cycles and the correlation I cited showed when they cooled, the earth cooled, and in a warming phase the land warmed. Dr. Roy Spencer has argued the PDO may cause three quarters of the current warming due to its effects on clouds (therefore our albedo) winds, and obviously tropical winds. And it heats the pacific, obviously warming the earth in that way too. Spencer has argued, 'mankind's CO2 emissions are not strong enough to have caused the global warming we've seen over the last 100 years.' And that 'Here I present new evidence that most of the warming could be the result of a natural cycle in cloud cover forced by a well-known mode of natural climate variability: the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). While the PDO is primarily a geographic rearrangement in atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns in the North Pacific, it is well known that such regional changes can also influence weather patterns over much larger areas, for instance North America or the entire Northern Hemisphere (which is, by the way, the region over which the vast majority of global warming has occurred).[emphasis added]'[3] For my opponents argument to work, he would need to prove the PDO and other currents would only affect the regional areas (as he argued with his map). However, the cloud cover changes caused by the PDO would change the earths albedo and cause warming for the entire northern hemisphere, and as he noted that's where the warming is primarily occurring.  1. Global warming is real and is a threat  My opponent has argued this warming is unusually fast, which is interesting, as I have argued above that warming has stopped in recent years. With the stop of warming in recent years, it is odd to argue it is rising unusually fast. Models have overestimated the effect of CO2, claiming over the last 15-20 years the warming should have increased'a lot'however the warming has stopped [4]. The earth has actually been significantly warmer throughout its time period, when comparing us to other time periods in geologic history we are in an ice age. According to the 1995 IPCC report, our warming as been extremely insignificant and fairly normal. Climate geologists, generally, oppose climate alarmism. Many of the most well known geologists have argued the current warming is 'right on schedule'. Nothing about our warming is odd, different, or one of a kind [5].  The sea level raises my opponent points too are exaggerated. There is vast evidence that sea level rise is meager to nonexistent. A 2003 study finds sea level rise has only been about .5 mm a year, half of what my opponent has argued. A 2004 study finds before 1940, sea level rise was about 1mm per year'my opponent's number'but finds there has been no sea level increase (overall) after that date. Another 2004 study found, when you averaged the whole 20th century, we get 1.8mm rise per year, but when you break it into chunks (1950-2000) no sea level rose in that time period. And yet another 2004 study finds that the sea level increase is overall uncertain. They note in their study they believe sea level has risen 2 mm per year, however they failed to control for regional variability. They said their study answers many questions and creates many more, and conclude one cannot conclude anything. A 2005 study finds no increase in sea levels since 1950. And the list continues, the evidence that sea level rise is meager is growing [6].  My opponent has admitted no increase of hurricanes was argued. In other words, even if intensity increases but the number falls, we are left with a wash. However, even the intensity argument fails. Pro argues my data is incomplete'focusing on landfall hurricanes'although that's what really matters (or at least matters more) then sea hurricanes, his argument still falls when I extend the data set. So let me again note: the number of hurricanes overall has fallen, and my opponent overall drops that point. Many studies project a 5% increase in hurricane intensity, however a 2005 study (although concluding higher intensity) says that number is twice as high as it should be. Other studies have found intensity to be the same or actually decrease. The 2005 study agreeing with my opponent, in a way, argues reducing CO2 emissions (which would occur by using green energy as the resolution states) would not change Hurricane intensity. A 2006 study finds there is no correlation between global warming and wind speeds in Hurricanes. A second 2006 study replicates the results, arguing there is no current correlation between Hurricane intensity and warming. Multiple 2007 and 2008 studies replicate these findings, arguing 'if there is an increase in hurricane activity connected to a greenhouse gas induced global warming, it is currently obscured' (Chylek, P. and Lesins 2008) and that 'no evidence that the distributional mean of individual storm intensity, measured by storm days, track length, or individual storm power dissipation index, has changed (increased or decreased) through time.' (Briggs 2008) [7]. The evidence is pretty compelling: no Hurricane intensity changes have occurred. Remember: this is using non-landfall data too (making my opponents objection refuted). And there is some evidence that global warming reduces the total number of hurricanes meaning an overall decrease of extreme weather occurs.  My opponent plays semantics. In this debate climate change, as implied in round one, is global warming. The dust bowl, as I argued, was caused by farming and not a warming earth. Therefore, his objection is irrelevant. A drought in the 16th century has been deemed a mega drought by a 2000 study. It was the largest drought in human history, before humans could have caused it. Droughts within the last 1000 years are much more severe then now, and a 1998 study noted there was a decrease of droughts in the 20th century. Warming has no correlation with droughts, however overall sun intensity (which, sometimes, means warming may correlate with droughts) and regional warming from the suns rays caused droughts, not human processes [8]. Hunnington (2006) has pointed out rainfall globally has been increasing. Many studies have concluded rainfall will increase because of global warming; plant growth will increase, decreasing the possibility of a drought [9].  2. Caused by humans  My opponent uses flawed data, my data was 60 million years ago, and my opponent has used data from the creations, 5-6 million years before. As CO2 naturally fluctuates with climate change'climate change often causes more CO2'it would not be unheard of for the ppm levels to be close too, or far from, other dates. My opponent also falsely correlated CO2 with temperature; by arguing it cannot be that close, the Cambrian was warmer. As stated, the historical correlation between CO2 and temperature is nonexistent, with CO2 lagging temperature or not correlating at all. The CO2 was 2000-3000 ppm 60 mya, by measuring oxygen isotopes. This data is impeccable, and my opponents Cambrian objection makes little sense, its not odd that CO2 was not much lower at this time period, as CO2 and temperature historically don't correlate well his Cambrian objection is a weak one [10].  My opponent really doesn't refute my lagging argument, only posts links. Those links only talk about modern temperature trends, meaning source seven stands. And when looking at data millions of years ago, it won't matter if the study was published in 1999 or 2012. But if date is what he wants, recent papers back my findings too [11].  3. Fixing the problem  The resolution is in present tense, so saying 'it will get better later' is against the wording of the resolution. However, lets refute the 'future' argument. It is impossible to replace fossil fuels with green energy, New York would need 60 square miles of wind turbines and the wind to be blowing 100% of the time to power the city. Wind power has always been more expensive then fossil fuels, and new research has still failed to fix that problem. Bio fuels and other sources are quite inefficient and waste other resources in the process. Current renewable are a joke, and billions (if not trillions) of dollars are needed to make them competitive, which is not worth the cost, especially as I argued warming may help humans and more CO2 = more plants. Green energy is not a logical solution [12]. If the Kyto agreement would not stop warming, and is only a first step, converting to green energy would likely have no effect [5]. Further, photovoltaic's are inefficient, and uncompetitive [6].  4. Extinctions  First, CO2 is not a pollutant, meaning his position is illogical here.  Second, mass extinctions are not occurring. A 2009 study notes, ''after five years, a re-visitation of the summit areas revealed a considerable increase of species richness at the upper alpine and subnival zone (10% and 9%, respectively) and relatively modest increases at the lower alpine zone and the treeline ecotone (3% and 1%, respectively).' In addition, with respect to threats of extinction, they reported that 'during the last five years, the endemic species of the research area were hardly affected,' while 'at the highest summit, one endemic species was even among the newcomers.'[14]  As we can see, animals are not being affected by warming.  CONCLUSION:  Global warming is (1) exaggerated, (2) not man made, (3) fixing it is impossible, and would not help anyone, and (4) extinctions are a widely popularized myth that has been refuted.  http://www.debate.org...</h>

    <t>Hello, Mac, and I am glad you instigated this debate.   My opponent’s arguments rely on three main contentions:   1)   Global warming is real and is a threat 2)   Global warming is caused by human activity 3)   We should attempt to stop global warming   I will refute them as follows:   1. Global warming is real and a threat   My opponent’s main point here is the expected sea level rise. However, some scientific papers have been released showing the sea level rise has been over predicted and that in many parts of the world, sea level rise isn’t happening at all. The IPCC’s data claiming massive sea level rise has been grossly exaggerated and is utterly incorrect. For example, Bangladesh should have been engulfed in water, or should be seeing significant problems. In 2007, the IPCC proclaimed their doomsday. However recent data shows the sea levels there are not rising [1].   My opponent also forgets the possible benefits of Global Warming. For example, parts of Canada, Russia, and Argentina too cold for industrialization and farming would become reachable. Historically, warmer temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere acted as a benefit for the Vikings. Greenland and Iceland’s productivity rose, the increased rain caused better harvests, and lead to the Vikings making landfall in the New World. The increased CO2 would make plant growth easier and enhance the world, making it muck more habitable. Some of the warmest periods in our history, the world flourished with resources aplenty; a warmer climate could easily be good for you and me [2].   My opponents other point here is the reality of global warming, and here I agree. There has been an overall warming trend since 1850, however I dispute current warming. Global warming stopped in 1997, with an overall decrease in temperature since then. Using NOAA data starting from 2000, to avoid the El Niño year in 1998 (which ‘refutes’ the global warming stopped theory) shows no change. A slight decrease in temperature, although the trend is less. There has been no warming since 1997, and no statistically significant warming since 1995 [3].   2. Humans are the cause of global warming    This is the main contention of the debate; if it is awful, but natural, we can’t stop it: changing our ways of life would be worthless. If it is still happening but is natural, we can’t stop it and changing would, again, be a pointless exercise. So, I explain the reasoning on why claiming humans cause global warming is illogical.   First, CO2 and other emissions increase during a good economy. After the 1940’s, a post-war economic boom occurred. At this time, when CO2 increased, is when scientists said humans first began to have a large impact on global warming. Interestingly, temperatures decreased at this time. Alarmists have tried to counter these claims, but their logic fails to hold up [4].   Either way, my opponent has only assumed humans are the main cause of the warming; he has given little evidence himself that we are the cause.   Correlation is always an argument in this debate. People have argued there is a strong correlation between CO2 and temperature, however this is simply untrue. CO2 only correlates r= .44, with 1 being perfect and 0 being none at all. This means the correlation rates fair to poor. The sun scores better, with an r= .57, meaning it rates to fair to good. And the PDO correlates the best, with an 0.83 rating good [5]. It seems hard to argue CO2 causes the warming when it fails to correlate to a degree of ‘good’ and its rivals for the title—the sun and the PDO—correlate much better then it.   Further, the current warming should have been predicted, as according to Singers 1,500 sun cycle the current warming was right on time. The majority of geologists—about 50%—believe global warming is a natural cycle and the current warming is right on time [6].   Other explanations, like cosmic rays, also seems like a possible factors. In short wording: Humans likely do not play a major role in global warming, although we likely exacerbate the situation a little bit.   3. It should be stopped—specifically with green energy   If my opponent wishes to bring up another solution, I am all ears. However he currently argues green energy is the solution. Lets go down the list:   a) Wind power   There is a simple problem with wind: the fact that wind is not always blowing, and its upfront capital costs more then outweighs the fact that wind, itself, is free. Wind itself has lees value then its fossil fuel competitors and must be placed in areas with constant (or higher then average) wind amounts, limiting its universality. Unlike Fossil fuel plants, which can be planted anywhere. There is other, in my opinion more real, issues then global warming. Wind stations kill the avian populations and take up a lot of space, often ruining natural beauty. Many rodents actually like the wind farms and live inside the fan. Rodents—a food source for many predators—get killed trying to eat them. And, obviously, other birds will fly through the places and get whacked and die. Some Wind projects take 10 billion pounds of raw materials. If we assume global warming is man made, the CO2 created by the mining and construction often times shrinks the overall benefit. b) Solar   Potential market chare for solar has been overestimated time and time again and the subsidies that the industry relies on—because it is not competitive with fossil fuel because the marker does not favor it—costs millions of dollars, even more then the Wind subsidies. Thermal solar plants need 1,000 times more the resources fossil fuel plants need. Some studies argue:   “Solar Two looks good on paper, and it is expected to provide steady baseload electricity as well as late afternoon peaking capacity, but the future of all the central solar generators is in doubt. They are expensive to build, their very scale escalates financial risks--as with nuclear power--and their massive height (in excess of 200 meters) may attract opposition.”[7]   Other Solar industries (there are many) require millions of dollars to operate and to even be on the market and commercialize their products. Many environmentalists have a actually given up on some solar markets, like photovoltaic, in favor of nuclear (something they usually despise) because of the destruction of those solar plants.   c) Hydro   Even environmentalists have left hydro power, uttering the power source in the same breath as they do natural gas, coal, and nuclear. From a conservative standpoint, the construction of Hydro power is actually very invasive on the surrounding community and cost millions. On a more liberal note, the hydro plants take a lot of resources to build and kill and disturb many fish populations. The cost of current hydro plants are 5-6 times more expensive per kilowatt hour then other fossil fuels.   d) Case study: Michigan   There has been no net job growth because of their green energy, they have created jobs in one sector but have taken them away from another. Their energy prices have increased and their prices continue to increase. Other states, like North Dakota, have welcomed fossil fuels and have had a net job growth and prices fall. Studies have shown for every one job created in their oil industry, another three are created because of decreased energy costs [8].   CONCLUSION:   I have proven my opponents premises to be incorrect and his solution of green energy is impractical, harmful to the economy, and, sometimes, not even green.

    <t>1. Global warming is real and is a threat      It was implied that there was global warming, because if there wasn’t this debate would be futile. Hence my wanting to bring it up. My opponent has claimed there has been no rapid changes in climate before. This is untrue, according to the 1995 IPCC our warming really isn’t unusual at all.       So my opponent and I agree, on balance it has warmed since the 1800s, but we differ on when it stopped. My opponent has been vague on the 1995 tipping point, saying it is a true statement but we are seeing the effects of global warming. This makes little sense, however, because if global warming stopped over 10 years ago why are we seeing the effects now? Regardless, the hurricane theory is a weak one. In the 1990s, for example, hurricanes were rare and not intense. Since the 1940s, the National Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory finds that the number of hurricanes and the intensity of hurricanes have actually been falling [1]. In the past 50 years, not one decade experienced an above average amount of hurricanes (7 is the average – where we are in our current decade). Within the last 50 years, an average of 5.6 hurricanes hit the US. In the 50 years before humans supposedly began to cause global warming, the average was 8.4 hurricanes—an overall downward trend [2].   Since 1900, the US hurricane intensity trend has flat lined, and decreased since the 1950’s intensity has fallen [3].   My opponent has also argued Global warming has caused droughts. Plotting the drought severity index over the last 60 years, a new paper published in Nature shows little trend in droughts throughout the world [4]. My opponent links GW to the dust bowl, which is actually odd: even climate scientists arguing humans caused global warming claim we had no impact on climate until the 50’s, after the dust bowl ended. The cause of the dustbowl, although partly not enough water, was also caused by overgrazing and over farming, wearing out (and drying out) the soil, leaving the land with little vegetation giving way to large sandstorms. Land cultivation tripled in the 30’s, causing the plants to wither away. Then drought struck, leaving over cultivated, dry, weak soil, none of which caused by man made global warming [5]. When narrowing down to the US, our precipitation (on balance) has been increasing and droughts exhibit no trend [6].   2. Humans are the cause of Global Warming   My opponent has argued past climate changes prove CO2 is the cause, however when you look at the data there is actually no correlation between CO2 and temperature. Temperature changes regardless of CO2 levels.           Using past historical trends actually refutes my opponent’s argument. Many studies done through ice cores show co2 lags temperature, in other words temperature rises before co2 rises. Lets look at these studies:   Pearson and Palmer, 2000: They show co2 was about 3000 ppm 60 million years ago (mya) with a 0.3 oxygen isotope ratio. However, 13 million years later, the co2 dropped to 500 ppm; the oxygen isotope temperature dropped to zero (meaning a rise in temperature). Temperatures rose as CO2 drastically fell.   Pearson and Palmer 1999: 43 mya it was 5 degrees warmer Celsius, but co2 concentrations were only 385 ppm, below our current concentration today.   Pagani et al., 1999: this study found 150 mya cot concentration was only 180 ppm, but it was 6 degrees celcius warmer.   And the studies go on and on [7]. Past temperature records fail to prove global warming is caused by CO2.   Now, if warming is a natural cycle (I have shown how CO2 correlates poorly, but natural factors correlate much better) then the methane melt will happen regardless, and cannot be stopped. This is only significant if my opponent can argue global warming is driven by human emissions. And it is interesting, my opponents only data point for this I that they are melting too fast. When looking at glacier melt, worldwide there is no overall trend. For example, southern glaciers seem to be melting (Europe wise) but northern ones seem to be growing [8]. Interestignly, glaciers have been melting since 1850. And although arguably still losing mass, the amount they lose each year shrinks. According to Dowdenswel et al., 1997, “Hence, although these Arctic glaciers continue to lose mass, as they have probably done since the end of the Little Ice Age, they are losing smaller amounts each year, in the mean, which is hardly what one would expect in the face of what climate alarmists incorrectly call the 'unprecedented' warming of the latter part of the twentieth century.”[9]     3. Fixing the problem   I agree we cannot just drop fossil fuels, if we change anything I recommend it is slowly, and preferably to nuclear. My opponent, however, makes weak points and are merely asserted. He does not prove renewable will become cheaper. It would be unlikely, as stated, though. Wind, for example, has no value (unlike fossil fuels). Many good alternatives (like hydro) have been taken out of the picture due to river destruction and invasive buildings (so its not really good). Wind and Solar are inefficient, and current subsidies are costing millions merely for failed companies to fail. These green energies fail to compete with fossil fuels because of their failure to be a viable option [10].   My opponent has conceded my points to be true but argues green energy will, in the future, be viable without little proof. I would also like to note the resolution is in present tense, so unless he can prove green energies will be viable soon or beneficial now he has lost this point.   Obviously we should not brush aside these sources, but combating climate change with them at the current time, and in the near future, would be illogical. Here is my solution: nuclear power. Its not a renewable, so I am not conceding the resolution, and it is “green”. I only support it due to its efficiency and ability to compete. If we cut down regulations, this solution would work (if you are worried about CO2, and if you’re like me: it would work if you are worried about our economy).   Conclusion:   I have proven (1) CO2 is likely not the cause of global warming, (2) even if it is, global warming is not dangerous and will likely benefit mankind (see round one, too)[11], and (3) combating global warming, a natural cycle, would be frivolous, and even if it is real green energy would be illogical and non-renewables such as Nuclear should be preferred.</t>

    <t>Thank you, Con, for accepting this debate so quickly.I would like to begin my rebuttal of the three main counterarguments made in my opponent's last round. 1. Global Warming is real and a threatAs I recall, in my opening round I never proclaimed that there was global warming; merely that there is rapid changes in the Earth's climate as never before documented or noticed in geological records. There is a definite warming in specific parts of the world, [1] but there are also other areas with the same -- or even colder -- temperatures as when weather recording began in the U.S.A. in 1869. [2]Climate change is not only occurring, according to many scientific studies, but will be a threat if these trends continue. My opponent says that the temperature has not risen since 1995, and all months since have been colder on average. This statement is valid. However, the effects of our changing climate are growing each year, as showing by increases in hurricane severity in the last 60 years [3], as well as droughts that will soon rival the Dustbowl of the 1920s (which was a major factor in the Great Depression). [4]As for the possible benefits of climate change, this massive release of CO2 may, in the short term, bring benefits to organisms that undergo photosynthetic processes, but we must remember that more than carbon dioxide is released through the burning of fossil fuels. Carbon, for example, provided 33% of America's energy needs in 2011 [5]. The maximum thermodynamic efficiency of this fuel source in the common steam-turbine is only 35%. Heat is wasted, and adding more heat may increase the efficiency of combustion, but it continues to produce more waste heat and requires even more input energy, raising the output energy by a maximum of 5%. [6] To save time, I will only discuss air pollutants of coal burning. Over 20 toxic impurities are released through this process, including arsenic, lead, mercury, and fly ash. [7]2. Humans are the cause of global warming climate change*There are many ways to prove either side of this point. Geological evidence shows that there have been shifts in the Earth's mean temperature many times. The most notable being that of the Carboniferous era from 359.2 (± 2.5) m.y.a. (1*) to 299 (± .8) m.y.a. This era had an atmospheric content of 1,173 ppm (2*), which spurred plant growth unrivaled by any other era. [8,9] However, this change in carbon content took millions of years, and is actually a decrease from any previous time. During this time, the mean temperature in the Cambrian Era fell from 21 degrees centigrade to 14 degrees centigrade, which shows a correlation between carbon content and average temperature. [10]Now that I have shown the connection between atmospheric carbon and temperature, allow me to refute Con's argument. Not only is the planet being filled with more atmospheric carbon faster than ever before, but it can only continue to worsen as the ice caps laden with carbon dioxide and methane melt. [11] This additional CH4 and CO2 will increase the pace of ice melt, releasing more gas. These ice caps would naturally melt on their own terms, but not as quickly as they currently are. The rapid nature of this melt is set off by humans adding tons of gases each year to the atmosphere that trap heat, and melt the ice. Human induced climate changes also change the temperature of the air and water that flows to the poles, hindering the ability to create seasonal ice in the first place. [12]We must also remember that this post-wartime economic boom was based in industry, not in the fact that there was a sudden release of CO2. This boom was man made, in the fact that people owed us money, and we had all the goods we could need (for the time being). 3. It should be stopped--specfically with green energyAs of today, we cannot just drop all our fossil fuel consumption. It may be at least two more decades before we can have a 50-50 split between cheap renewable energy and fossil fuel combustion. In the last 10 years, however, we have made many strides forward in the efficiency. My opponent's points are accurate, but we do not currently need to rely soley on renewable energy so we do not, as consumers, need to worry about the inefficiency of the current sources. Within the next few years we will be up to par with our dream energy production, but until then the best a normal person can do to acheive this goal is push for legislation to mandate cleaner sources and support current research.To give up on these new sources now would be illogical, and prove our years of prior research to have been frivilous.In Conclusion:I have rebutted all of my opponent's points which were based on interperatable data and sources, in effect, proving that Climate Change is a threat, it is aided in growth by humans, and we can stop it with more efficient energy.

    <t>If you were born after February 1985, [1] you have never experienced a colder than average month. This, coupled with obvious decrease in Arctic, Antarctic, and Greenland ice sheets is a frightening sight. [2]  It may seem obvious to most that this is a terrible thing, as sea levels rise and weather patterns change, we could be in a peck of trouble. However, there are always those who believe that Climate Change is just a hoax, thought up by Liberal politicians and science advocates. To them, I say, 'Nay!' for you would be incorrect. In the last years, climate change is beginning to gain conclusive evidence to support it's existence.  As the world becomes less of what it was a century ago, we must adopt new technologies and policies to save our Blue Planet and the beautiful life that exists on it (because, hey. No where else have we found life.).  This is our home, and even if it means sacrificing a little of our hard-earned cash to save it, we must do everything we can.

    <t>My opponent has argued that the moderate to poor correlation of CO2 is enough to be considered major, however this is illogical. First, I never said CO2 had no effect, I argued it was not the main cause. Second, it is unlikely increasing CO2 has a large impact because CO2 increases are logarithmic, in other words the more CO2 there is the less warming effect each unit has. If we double the amount of CO2 from pre-industrial levels (we have gone through 30-50% increase) then warming per I increase would be extremely small. A 20 ppm increase of CO2 would be much less then 0.2 degrees Celsius [1]. Second, the climate is not very sensitive; a better way to put it would be an increase in CO2 would have little effect. The evidence claiming climate to be sensitive are very flawed, they ignore climate feedbacks and other factors relating to sensitivity. If CO2 were to double, only a 1 degree increase would occur, we have not doubled CO2 levels from the pre-industrial era and have warmed less then one degree Celsius. With current emissions it is unlikely we could argue CO2 is the main driver of climate change, when sensitivity is taken into account [2].  Second, my opponents rebuttal to the PDO and AMO argues the correlation is due to the seas space, however he ignores the fact the PDO and AMO go into cooling cycles and the correlation I cited showed when they cooled, the earth cooled, and in a warming phase the land warmed. Dr. Roy Spencer has argued the PDO may cause three quarters of the current warming due to its effects on clouds (therefore our albedo) winds, and obviously tropical winds. And it heats the pacific, obviously warming the earth in that way too. Spencer has argued, 'mankind's CO2 emissions are not strong enough to have caused the global warming we've seen over the last 100 years.' And that 'Here I present new evidence that most of the warming could be the result of a natural cycle in cloud cover forced by a well-known mode of natural climate variability: the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). While the PDO is primarily a geographic rearrangement in atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns in the North Pacific, it is well known that such regional changes can also influence weather patterns over much larger areas, for instance North America or the entire Northern Hemisphere (which is, by the way, the region over which the vast majority of global warming has occurred).[emphasis added]'[3] For my opponents argument to work, he would need to prove the PDO and other currents would only affect the regional areas (as he argued with his map). However, the cloud cover changes caused by the PDO would change the earths albedo and cause warming for the entire northern hemisphere, and as he noted that's where the warming is primarily occurring.  1. Global warming is real and is a threat  My opponent has argued this warming is unusually fast, which is interesting, as I have argued above that warming has stopped in recent years. With the stop of warming in recent years, it is odd to argue it is rising unusually fast. Models have overestimated the effect of CO2, claiming over the last 15-20 years the warming should have increased'a lot'however the warming has stopped [4]. The earth has actually been significantly warmer throughout its time period, when comparing us to other time periods in geologic history we are in an ice age. According to the 1995 IPCC report, our warming as been extremely insignificant and fairly normal. Climate geologists, generally, oppose climate alarmism. Many of the most well known geologists have argued the current warming is 'right on schedule'. Nothing about our warming is odd, different, or one of a kind [5].  The sea level raises my opponent points too are exaggerated. There is vast evidence that sea level rise is meager to nonexistent. A 2003 study finds sea level rise has only been about .5 mm a year, half of what my opponent has argued. A 2004 study finds before 1940, sea level rise was about 1mm per year'my opponent's number'but finds there has been no sea level increase (overall) after that date. Another 2004 study found, when you averaged the whole 20th century, we get 1.8mm rise per year, but when you break it into chunks (1950-2000) no sea level rose in that time period. And yet another 2004 study finds that the sea level increase is overall uncertain. They note in their study they believe sea level has risen 2 mm per year, however they failed to control for regional variability. They said their study answers many questions and creates many more, and conclude one cannot conclude anything. A 2005 study finds no increase in sea levels since 1950. And the list continues, the evidence that sea level rise is meager is growing [6].  My opponent has admitted no increase of hurricanes was argued. In other words, even if intensity increases but the number falls, we are left with a wash. However, even the intensity argument fails. Pro argues my data is incomplete'focusing on landfall hurricanes'although that's what really matters (or at least matters more) then sea hurricanes, his argument still falls when I extend the data set. So let me again note: the number of hurricanes overall has fallen, and my opponent overall drops that point. Many studies project a 5% increase in hurricane intensity, however a 2005 study (although concluding higher intensity) says that number is twice as high as it should be. Other studies have found intensity to be the same or actually decrease. The 2005 study agreeing with my opponent, in a way, argues reducing CO2 emissions (which would occur by using green energy as the resolution states) would not change Hurricane intensity. A 2006 study finds there is no correlation between global warming and wind speeds in Hurricanes. A second 2006 study replicates the results, arguing there is no current correlation between Hurricane intensity and warming. Multiple 2007 and 2008 studies replicate these findings, arguing 'if there is an increase in hurricane activity connected to a greenhouse gas induced global warming, it is currently obscured' (Chylek, P. and Lesins 2008) and that 'no evidence that the distributional mean of individual storm intensity, measured by storm days, track length, or individual storm power dissipation index, has changed (increased or decreased) through time.' (Briggs 2008) [7]. The evidence is pretty compelling: no Hurricane intensity changes have occurred. Remember: this is using non-landfall data too (making my opponents objection refuted). And there is some evidence that global warming reduces the total number of hurricanes meaning an overall decrease of extreme weather occurs.  My opponent plays semantics. In this debate climate change, as implied in round one, is global warming. The dust bowl, as I argued, was caused by farming and not a warming earth. Therefore, his objection is irrelevant. A drought in the 16th century has been deemed a mega drought by a 2000 study. It was the largest drought in human history, before humans could have caused it. Droughts within the last 1000 years are much more severe then now, and a 1998 study noted there was a decrease of droughts in the 20th century. Warming has no correlation with droughts, however overall sun intensity (which, sometimes, means warming may correlate with droughts) and regional warming from the suns rays caused droughts, not human processes [8]. Hunnington (2006) has pointed out rainfall globally has been increasing. Many studies have concluded rainfall will increase because of global warming; plant growth will increase, decreasing the possibility of a drought [9].  2. Caused by humans  My opponent uses flawed data, my data was 60 million years ago, and my opponent has used data from the creations, 5-6 million years before. As CO2 naturally fluctuates with climate change'climate change often causes more CO2'it would not be unheard of for the ppm levels to be close too, or far from, other dates. My opponent also falsely correlated CO2 with temperature; by arguing it cannot be that close, the Cambrian was warmer. As stated, the historical correlation between CO2 and temperature is nonexistent, with CO2 lagging temperature or not correlating at all. The CO2 was 2000-3000 ppm 60 mya, by measuring oxygen isotopes. This data is impeccable, and my opponents Cambrian objection makes little sense, its not odd that CO2 was not much lower at this time period, as CO2 and temperature historically don't correlate well his Cambrian objection is a weak one [10].  My opponent really doesn't refute my lagging argument, only posts links. Those links only talk about modern temperature trends, meaning source seven stands. And when looking at data millions of years ago, it won't matter if the study was published in 1999 or 2012. But if date is what he wants, recent papers back my findings too [11].  3. Fixing the problem  The resolution is in present tense, so saying 'it will get better later' is against the wording of the resolution. However, lets refute the 'future' argument. It is impossible to replace fossil fuels with green energy, New York would need 60 square miles of wind turbines and the wind to be blowing 100% of the time to power the city. Wind power has always been more expensive then fossil fuels, and new research has still failed to fix that problem. Bio fuels and other sources are quite inefficient and waste other resources in the process. Current renewable are a joke, and billions (if not trillions) of dollars are needed to make them competitive, which is not worth the cost, especially as I argued warming may help humans and more CO2 = more plants. Green energy is not a logical solution [12]. If the Kyto agreement would not stop warming, and is only a first step, converting to green energy would likely have no effect [5]. Further, photovoltaic's are inefficient, and uncompetitive [6].  4. Extinctions  First, CO2 is not a pollutant, meaning his position is illogical here.  Second, mass extinctions are not occurring. A 2009 study notes, ''after five years, a re-visitation of the summit areas revealed a considerable increase of species richness at the upper alpine and subnival zone (10% and 9%, respectively) and relatively modest increases at the lower alpine zone and the treeline ecotone (3% and 1%, respectively).' In addition, with respect to threats of extinction, they reported that 'during the last five years, the endemic species of the research area were hardly affected,' while 'at the highest summit, one endemic species was even among the newcomers.'[14]  As we can see, animals are not being affected by warming.  CONCLUSION:  Global warming is (1) exaggerated, (2) not man made, (3) fixing it is impossible, and would not help anyone, and (4) extinctions are a widely popularized myth that has been refuted. </t>

    <t>Before I begin, I would like to bring up a prior statement you made from Round One: 'Correlation is always an argument in this debate...It seems hard to argue CO2 causes the warming when it fails to correlate to a degree of ‘good’ and its rivals for the title—the sun and the PDO—correlate much better then it.' (See Round one for full quote.) . I would like to point out that this is true, but the Regression Factor of CO2 would of course not be as effectual as the Irradiance of the Sun, as that is where all energy on our planet originates. The r=.44 of Carbon is not as large as the PDO and AMO (Pacific and Atlantic Decadal Oscillation), but .44 still means that there is a strong enough correlation, that it may affect our mean temperature. Of course, the .83 r factor of our currents is more effectual, since a large amount of our world’s heat is stored in our oceans as shown in the following chart: [2]  Notice that there are more high temperature areas in the oceans (mostly since the ocean is 75% of the Earth's surface area), and that they go farther North and South than the land masses do. This was meant to be included in my last round, I'm sorry for including it now.   1. Climate Change is real and is a threat   There definitely have been natural warmings of our planet, but never as fast as these last 162 years in which we have kept records of our planet's weather. In the last 7 years alone, Carbon counts globally have risen 18ppm according to various studies. [1, 3] In regards to the end of a noticeable rise in temperature being 1995, I still wholly agree. However: it is well known that just because one thing happens, the effects of it are not immediately felt. Just as how we are only now seeing light from stars that shone that light millions of years ago. The ocean's currents will not change immediately, but slowly over a few years, as will sea level. Though sea levels aren't rising worldwide, they are growing by an average rate of 3.11mm per year, an increase in the average (documented prior to 2000) of 1.63mm more per year. [4] 'However, the effects of our changing climate are growing each year, as showing by increases in hurricane severity in the last 60 years,' is a quote from my Round Two which you referenced in your rebuttal: 'Regardless...the average was 8.4 hurricanes—an overall downward trend [2].' (See Round two for full quote) I would like to point out that I never said there were more hurricanes, only that these storms were stronger than before. Again, I will cite this: [5] As for your claim that hurricane intensity has flat lined, realize that your source only documents hurricanes post-landfall. Landfall is when the eye of the hurricane is only on land, and hurricanes begin to lose force as the storm's boundaries cross the shore line, so most hurricanes are documented at a weaker strength after they have already done the majority of the damage they can. [6] Allow me to define climate: noun. 1. The composite or generally prevailing weather conditions of a region, as temperature, air pressure, humidity, precipitation, sunshine, cloudiness, and winds, throughout the year, averaged over a series of years. 2. The prevailing attitudes, standards, or environmental conditions of a group, period, or place: a climate of political unrest.  [7] According to this, the dust bowl was an effect of climate change, and my opponent even says that it was caused by humans through over-farming.   2. Humans are the cause of climate change First thing I would like to say in this section is that your source 7 is out of date, as many more have been released since then that contradict what is put forth here. [3, 8] As for Carbon ppm being 3000ppm 60mya, I must cry false, as 3000ppm is only a few thousand ppm lower than during the Cambrian era, in which the mean temperature was 7 degrees centigrade higher than today. 60mya, Carbon ppm was, at its highest peak, 1700ppm during the last years of Cretaceous era, and 500ppm only 6 million years later in the Paleocene era. [9-11] In accordance to your claim that glaciers are growing, I will argue that, saying that they grow in height, but not enough to compensate for the amount lost -- or not even gained in the first place -- each year. I can agree that these ice masses slowed their ice loss, but they resumed to lose more after your source 8 and 9 were published. [12, 13]   3. Fixing the problem   Renewable energy sources are continuing to become more efficient. Remember: it took us, as Hominids, 400,000 to achieve the level of efficiency we have today in combustion. [14, 15] To dismiss our strides in renewable energy so quickly is rash and immature as a species. Sure, wind turbines are dangerous to avian life. Hydro plants are obtrusive and change the local climate due to human interference. [16] Solar cells are expensive and large, and the output is not always sufficient. However! These innovations are from the last century, and in the next decade, we will have technologies that will far surpass what we have today as a renewable source. Even now, the photovoltaics which Con so easily dismissed are being produced and developed more than any renewable source (nuclear excluded, not renewable) with 1/100th the cost and 50% more efficiency. These are simply trial versions as well. [17] Wind kites can harness energy for the average home with no human maintenance and a 30-50-killowatt/hour range, with even more effective versions in development. [18] Biomass fuels are becoming more common [19] and soon may be one of the must substantial sources of fuel. Nuclear energy is the best we have (for now) in lieu of a completely clean renewable energy. If these energies were more substantial in countries such as China, India, Bangladesh, etc., the crisis we may be facing in the next decade can be stopped before it even starts. New Section: 4. The animal effect Concentrated atmospheric pollution kills millions of animals and gives humans living there life-threatening complications. [20] As these animals die from new diseases, pollution, and habitat loss (also climate change), we face a grim future. The complex chain of animals in our environment is so precarious, that one extinction or introduction could topple a whole ecosystem, throwing that climate in to turmoil, domino-ing the whole planet. In Conclusion! I believe that this round gives a broader view of the problem than Con is willing to propose, but cannot be neglected. </t>
<h>    Before I begin, I would like to bring up a prior statement you made from Round One: 'Correlation is always an argument in this debate...It seems hard to argue CO2 causes the warming when it fails to correlate to a degree of ‘good’ and its rivals for the title—the sun and the PDO—correlate much better then it.'</h>
  </pair>

    <t>I would also like to thank my opponent for this debate.   My opponent has admitted CO2 is not the chief cause in global warming, but that it has an effect. I have never denied CO2 has some effect, however I denied that it had a large one. My opponent has not negated this contention, and with it unrefuted it stands that the CO2 effect (and therefore the anthropogenic effect) is negligible, and taking a stand with green technologies would be a waste of money and effort.   My opponent has also dropped my PDO argument, conceding that the natural factors cause at least ¾ of the current warming. This only leaves ¼ of the current warming for any man-made forcing, and as stated the sun correlates better with climate. Accepting the fact that sun spot length correlates extremely well with climate, and other forgings such as cosmic rays and our position in the galaxy hint we should be warming, it leaves a small percentage of the current warming for man-made causes [1].   With this in mind, and global warming mainly a natural cycle, my opponent has failed to meet the BOP and prove global warming is man made and should be stopped.   1. Global warming is real and is a threat   My opponent has admitted that global warming does not exist. To be honest, I am confused by this statement. Is my opponent assuming global warming has stopped, or that it is mainly in the northern hemisphere? Regardless, it seems as though he has conceded that a global phenomena of global warming exists. I only partially agree. There was global warming in the 20th century, but the rate of warming has slowed and no warming has occurred since 1995 [1]. My opponent then continues saying he thinks warming will continue. This seems like a contradiction from his first point here. No matter, he has conceded multiple times the warming has stopped. So it seems illogical that it will keep increasing if it has already backtracked.   My opponent finished by saying our data is biased. Yes, it is. The question, however, is whose bias is correct. I have given, in my opinion, a more compelling case that my bias is correct and my side on the correct side of history. Therefore, biased data is irrelevant, but whose bias is correct is relevant. And I hope the voters, and others reading, can see my bias is correct.   My opponent has also dropped (and therefore conceded) that global warming does not cause hurricanes. I have provided many peer reviewed studies denying this effect, proving global warming is not a threat.   My opponent has also conceded my point that global warming helps the human race (see round 1 and two). So even if warming is man-made (it is not) then why should we stop a beneficial force?     2. Global warming is anthropogenic    My opponent starts with a NASA favorite: records breaking CO2 levels. However, when you look at the ice record, CO2 levels are at an all time low [1]. Interestingly, if we move the data back in time we see CO2 was breaking record in 1750 with 284 ppm, before human emissions where significant. From 1750 – 1875, CO2 rose 10 times faster ten anthropogenic CO2 emissions. It took humans 100 years to catch up with CO2 emissions (new emissions, not the total. We are less then 5% of the CO2 emissions in the atmosphere). The CO2 growth rate, although fast, is not “out of control” [2].   I would like to reiterate my sensitivity argument. Doubling CO2 would only increase temperatures by one degree Celsius. We have warmed .6 degrees Celsius (less using satellite data). We have only increased co2 35%. Therefore, CO2 likely had little effect on the current warming.   Now to my opponents data:   -- The first data set was irrelevant, it was before the date --The other data was far before the respected time period --Only your last data applied   The last data Wikipedia cherry picked as I stated Pearson 2000 documented the carbon ppm 60 million years ago. It said ppm was actually 500 ppm, we agree, but “the oxygen isotope ratio has dropped (implying a rise in temperature) to zero, which is, of course, just the opposite of what one would expect from the 'large and predictable effect' of CO2 on temperature that is commonly assumed.” Meaning carbon dropped but temperature rose. And the drop was substantial, showing co2 is not a strong climate driver [4]. My argument was that the spike near that time increased ppm to 3000, while temperature fell. The argument has been misinterpreted. We actually agree on the carbon count, but my opponent misses the point that there is no correlation between carbon and temperature.  I tried to post this in round one; it didn't work. It is the same point (so I am not bringing up anything new here), it merely makes it visual.   CO2 and Global Temp.? No correlation! And my opponent only speculates on the age of my data. If you read the source (round two, source 7) you see they used ice core data and tree ring proxies, still used in the climate debate and is a widely accepted proxy today.   3. Fighting the problem    “We are not ready to drop non-renewable fossil fuels. The profit is greater, and the amount of energy produced from these fuels far exceeds renewable energy. Hopefully, that can change. If not for a hopefully cleaner planet, then simply for the fact that we are going to run out one day. However, we will continue to grow in our ability to produce cheaper sustainable energy.” – My opponent My opponent invests his whole argument in faith that it will improve. Although passive solar houses might be a good idea (for those off the grid), my opponents point will always fail: the sun isn’t always shining, the wind not always flowing, the water not always flowing, but the pumps will keep on drilling and the nuclear plants will keep on burning. Fossil fuels should last 200 years, nuclear another 100. These estimates keep growing because we keep discovering new oil every day, not to mention some sea exploration would likely add the oil count by hundreds of years. We really don’t seem to be running out of oil because we keep finding more. Either way, green energy is not a constant or reliable energy source. Fossil fuels and nuclear power is. Take that how you wish; facts vs the faith of my opponent.   Conclusion: --Global warming is not man-made, stopping it would be pointless --Global warming is not harmful, and it is beneficial, why should we stop a good force? --Green energy is impractical --My opponent dropped (and therefore concedes as the truth) the: PDO, warming stopped, extinctions are not happening, the harm of global warming, droughts, and the fact that sea levels are not rising   Reading the debate (I hope) and my conclusion, I believe the voters should see it logical to vote for CON.     1.

    <t>I would like to thank 16kadams for a wonderful first debate, here at DDO.I also must admit that my opponent has put forth very valid arguments, some of which I greatly agree with. I hope that in the future -- when I am a more developed debater -- I may challenge him again.As for my correlation of CO2 to warming, I must stand strong with it. I am aware that it was not the largest factor, but this correlation rate will continue to drop as the ppm of Carbon Dioxide rises, as it is an inverse equality. This is not me conceding the fact that there is a correlation, but that as our world becomes more laden with CO2, each molecule will have less and less of an effect. 1. Global Warming is real and is a threatI do not believe in Global Warming, as it means to show that the whole planet is warming (which I do not believe), but I understand the general use of the term now, even in ways to describe climate change. I believe that there is a vast change in our climate, and will continue to be as such. Perhaps now our data is biased on both sides, pro- or con-climate change.2. Caused by humansI am well aware of the natural cycles of warming in Earth's geological history. Never before have we experienced such a sharp upward clime of Carbonppm without a natural calamity (such as eruptions, meteor collisions, etc.). To refute Con's claims on the 2,000-3,000ppm pf Carbon 60mya, I will use the same data as in my round 3. I used data from 66mya, 60mya, and 58mya, just to make sure I had all my bases covered, in case of his 60mya figure being an estimate.My attempted refute on your round2 source 7 was based on the grounds that our methods of measuring have become more efficient and accurate, so the data could be deemed inaccurate today (only a speculation).3. Fixing the problemWe are not ready to drop non-renewable fossil fuels. The profit is greater, and the amount of energy produced from these fuels far exceeds renewable energy. Hopefully, that can change. If not for a hopefully cleaner planet, then simply for the fact that we are going to run out one day. However, we will continue to grow in our ability to produce cheaper sustainable energy.In conclusion I have done the best in my ability to refute the claims Con has made and stabilize my views and hopes for the future. I hope to one day challenge another debater to a similar topic when I am more experienced. Vote PRO!</t>

    <t>Introduction:The problem I and many others have with the Cato Institute is the fact that it allows special interest groups (individuals, corporations and foundations) who fund it to hijack its message, even when that message is controversial. I will show three prominent examples of this, and then say why this matters to Cato's credibility.Argument #1Cato was a large proponent of the Big Tobacco industry, accepting large donations from Big Tobacco and in turn jumping on the Big Tobacco bandwagon.Proof that Cato recieves funding from Big Tobacco: Source: Americans for Nonsmoker's Rights, August 2004.'1. The Cato Institute received a $10,000 “philanthropic contribution” from Philip Morris in 1991.2. Between 1995 and 1998 alone, Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds jointly contributed at least $425,000 to the Cato Institute. One Philip Morris document budgets a $175,000 “policy payment” for the Cato Institute to focus on “Individual Liberties” and “Regulatory Issues”.3. The Wall Street Journal quoted Cato analyst Jerry Taylor as stating that the Cato Institute received over $100,000 from tobacco giant Philip Morris and $50,000 from RJ Reynolds in 1995 alone.4. According to a memo prepared and drafted by the law firm Covington and Burling for Philip Morris, entitled “1995 Tort Reform Program,” $600,000 was allocated for “National Think Tanks/Retained Consultants (e.g. Citizens for a Sound Economy, Cato Institute, Manhattan Institute, Hudson Institute)” to reduce the potential legal liability of corporations, including tobacco companies, for wrongfully harming their customers.5. Media mogul Rupert Murdoch sat on the Board of Directors at Philip Morris and the Cato Institute. Murdoch’s News Corporation owns numerous broadcasting and print media corporations, including Fox Broadcasting. News Corporation voted Philip Morris CEO Geoffrey Bible onto its board in 1998.'So know we know that Cato got the funding. How did they pay Big Tobacco back? Source: (1-4: Same as above) (4-6): National Review (4/20/12)'1. The Cato Institute has challenged credible science that links secondhand smoke exposure to death and disease and has organized opposition to smoke-free environments.2. An article in the San Francisco Chronicle, based on a report published by Public Citizen, stated that the Cato Institute was one of seven conservative think tanks that received at least $3.5 million between 1992 to 1995 from the drug and tobacco industries to “curb the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory powers.” Of the $3.5 million, Cato reportedly received at least $152,500 to counter the FDA’s regulatory process. According to the article:The think tanks have used the money to produce a “steady stream of reports, fact sheets, op-ed articles and newspapers, radio and television advertisements purporting to document the FDA’s deadly overcaution and bullying of manufacturers.”3. A 1995 Philip Morris document cites the Cato Institute as one of its “messengers” for relaying the tobacco company’s opposition to the FDA.4. In July 2000, the Cato Institute co-filed a brief with the National Smokers Alliance in the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit alleging that the Master Settlement Agreement violated U.S. antitrust law.Philip Morris listed Cato VP David Boaz as one of its “National Allies in a 2000 memo.5. Cato chairman Robert Levy, who today accuses the Kochs of turning Cato into “a mouthpiece of special interests,” once faithfully served the tobacco industry as a leading tobacco-death denialist. In his article, “Lies, Damn Lies amp; 400,000 Smoking-Related Deaths”, Levy claimed, “children do not die of tobacco-related diseases” and “there is no credible evidence that 400,000 deaths per year—or any number remotely close to 400,000—are caused by tobacco.” (In fact, tobacco use kills more than 5 million people a year worldwide.)6. In 2001, a British-American Tobacco executive sent a thank-you letter to Levy and the Cato Institute, noting: “I was also pleased to learn after our meeting that our subsidiary company, Brown amp; Williamson, provided the Cato Institute with funding in 2000.”Argument #2Cato and many of it's scholars are outspoken climate change skeptics, and really take it to the next level.Cato's actions on climate change/global warming: Source: (1-5: Greenpeace) (6: Wikipedia page on the Cato Institute)'1. Cato is a member of the State Policy Network, a network of state level think tanks and policy organizations that act as a coordinated front for a variety of corporate priorities including delaying action to mitigate global warming. The State Policy Network has promoted climate science denial conferences hosted by the Heartland Institute and circulated unscientific reports from Heartland's 'Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change.' Heartland's 'Climate Change Reconsidered' reports are authored by career climate deniers such as S. Fred Singer and Craig Idso.2. The organization's 2009 'Handbook for Policymakers' on global warming begins with the suggestions that Congress should 'pass no legislation restricting emissions of carbon dioxide' and 'inform the public about how little climate change would be prevented by proposed legislation.'3. Robert Bradley, an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute, is also a founder and the CEO of the Institute for Energy Research.4. In 2007 the Cato Foundation gave $120,000 to New Hope Environmental Services, an 'advocacy science consulting firm' founded and run by long-time climate science denier Patrick Michaels, who uses New Hope to publish his World Climate Report, a sort of ongoing journal of denial of climate science. Michaels is also a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, which paid him $98,000 to write a book, The Satanic Gases, with fellow skeptic Robert Balling. Over the years, Michaels' work has been financed by a number of coal and polluter interests, including the Western Fuels Association, the Intermountain Rural Electric Association, and others.5. In 2012, the Koch brothers sued the Cato Institute in order to exert more control over the organization. The lawsuit was dropped after an agreement was reached between the two parties, following months of highly-publicized attacks back and forth. David Koch remains on Cato's board of directors.6. Three out of five 'Doubters of Global Warming' interviewed by PBS's Frontline were funded by, or had some other institutional connection with, the Institute. Cato has often criticized Al Gore's stances on the issue of global warming and agreed with the Bush administratons's skeptical attitude toward the Kyoto protocols.Rationale for these actions: Source: (1: Greenpeace article above) (2, 3: Wikipedia page on Cato) (4: Sierra Club Magazine)'1. $1,285,750 received from Koch foundations 2005-2010 [Total Koch foundation grants 1997-2010: $5,535,750]2. Charles G. Koch cofounded Cato, was chairman of the board, was a shareholder along with David Koch, his brother, who are both anthropogenic climate change skeptics.3. David Koch is a member of Cato's board, and Kevin Gentry, employee and top aide to the Koch's also serves on the board.4. Charles and David Koch own Koch Industries. 'For Koch Industries, the amounts of money it can save by sabotaging environmental rules make the sums diverted to the think tanks that do the dirty work pale in comparison. The year 2000 was particularly rough for the Kochs. In January, Koch Industries agreed to pay about $35 million for violations of the Clean Water Act related to 310 oil spills in six states. Two months later, Koch admitted to environmental violations at its oil refinery in Rosemount, Minnesota, and was forced to cough up another $8 million in penalties. Then in July, it agreed not only to spend about $80 million to cut emissions from its Rosemount facility and from two other refineries in Texas, but also to pay a $1 million fine for air-pollution violations.'More examples to follow, but for now, out of characters.</t>

    <t>'C1: Cato and Big Tobacco'1) I may have been a touch misleading here, and I apologize for any confusion I may have caused. I am not arguing that the Institute is tailoring it's content to match it's donors interests in the way you just described, which, unfortunately, is difficult to prove without further evidence. I am not arguing that Cato exclusively accepted Big Tobacco funding to coincide with its anti-smoking efforts; I am arguing that the reason the Cato Institute exists is primarily to produce academic and legislative proposals that coincide with the interests of large corporations (note that they exist solely to make an economic profit) make those policies mainstream, and push them through Congress. What I am accusing Cato of is corporatism, and hijacking legislative policy to serve the interests of corporations, not citizens, not the public, not the world. It is no surprise ExxonMobil, Koch Industries, ChevronTexaco, Tenneco Gas, the American Petroleum Institute, the Amoco Foundation, the Claude R. Lamb Charitable foundation, the Charles G. Koch foundation, the Philip Anschutz foundation and the Atlantic Richfield Organization all fund the Cato Institute, to name the ties it has with the petroleum industry, but Cato also recieves funding from Big Pharma (Eli Lilly amp; Company, Merck amp; Company and Pfizer, Inc.) Big Finance (Citibank, Prudential, Chase Manhattan, American Express, Salomon Brothers) and Big Tech (Verizon, Microsoft, Sun Microsystems, Verisign, Netscape, BellSouth). It was from its start as you correctly described in line with general libertarianism and the belief in individual liberties that put it against a smoking ban, the FDA, etc. The reason you and I should take note of this is because while Cato claims to be nonpartisan and independent, those are selective definitions of the real meaning behind the words. Cato is a bastion of policies that coincide with the philosophy of the largest multinational conglomerates. We later discovered smoking was a problem, along with secondhand smoking, and it was banned and regulated. This of course was a loss for the corporations and Cato. If people knew who was behind Cato, they would be more skeptical of its policy proposals, just as many people are today of corporation's proposals, and for good reason.2) I suggest you read 'Lies, Damned Lies, and 400,000 Smoking related deaths,' (www.cato.org/pubs/regulation/regv21n4/lies.pdf) written by Robert A. Levy, chairman of Cato's board of directors, and senior fellow emeritus of constitutional studies, which ironically has little to do with science, especially medical science.This article was later refuted by the American Council of Science and Health, whose two authors, Alicia M. Lukachko, and Elizabeth M. Whelan, who each have a Masters degree in Public health, and a Doctor of Science. Read an excerpt from their critique: 'In the Fall 1998 issue of Regulation (“The Cato Review of Business and Government”), the Cato Institute published an article by Robert Levy and Rosalind Marimont titled “Lies, Damned Lies, amp; 400,000 Smoking-Related Deaths.” In their article, Levy and Marimont contend that the U.S. government’s estimate of approximately 400,000 annual premature deaths due to cigarette smoking is scientifically unsound and substantially inflated. The authors assert that “the war on smoking . . . has grown into a monster of deceit and greed, eroding the credibility of government and subverting the rule of law.” In this report, scientists at the American Council on Science and Health refute Levy and Marimont’s key arguments (presented below) as unscientific and inflammatory. ACSH’s critique concludes that the estimate of 400,000 annual deaths due to cigarette smoking is indeed reliable and may even be an underestimate.The authors make four primary assertions leading to their conclusion that the figure of 400,000 is inflated. Those four assertions and a summary of ACSH’s critique of each of them follow.' Response to my second claim, public places is what I am referring to. Smoking bans are dangerous to free soceity's health. And there's more where that came from. Read “the case against smoking bans” 'www.cato.org/pubs/regulation/regv29n4/v29n4-4.pdf'3)-Refer to above, where I underline why opposition to regulation not from the standpoint of society but instead corporate interests has a negative effect on society and is undeserving of respect.1) First, Pro's only claim is that Cato holds to a certain position without actually even attempting to show why it should discredit Cato...'Umm... Because you have business interests tied to that, and other issues, which you have surreptitiously accepted funding to reaffirm your position. For example, read this headline. 'Patrick Michaels, fellow at the Cato Institute, claimed 3% of his funding came from industry, later revealed that figure to be 40%.'2) Oxford Handbook on Climate Change: 'The earlier-mentioned conservative resurgence began when wealthy conservative philanthropists such as Joseph Coors began to fund, typically through their family foundations, the establishment of conservative think tanks (CTTs) such as the Heritage Foundation towage a ‘war of ideas’ against the progressive gains of the 1960s (Himmelstein 1990; Lapham 2004). By the 1990s conservative foundations were funding a ‘conservative labyrinth' designed to implant conservative values and goals in academic, media,governmental,legal, and religious institutions (Covington 1997: 3). Particularly important is the network of well-heeled and inﬂuential think tanks that churn out an endless ﬂow of policy proposals credited with moving the US policy agenda signiﬁcantly to the right (Krehely et al. 2004) and—since the 1990s—influencing climate policy (McCright and Dunlap 2003, 2010). Major funders include foundations controlled by Richard Mellon Scaife and David and Charles Koch (both drawing upon family fortunes stemming in part from oil interests). Besides giving generously to a vast range of CTTs and conservative causes, they are responsible for establishing the Cato Institute (C. Koch), Citizens for a Sound Economy, now Americans for Prosperity (D. Koch) and Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow or CFACT (R. M. Scaife)—three particularly crucial elements of the denial machine. ln fact, in recent years the Scaife and Koch families of funds may have exceeded ExxonMobil in terms of funding climate change denial actors and activities (Grandia 2009; Greenpeace 2010b; Mashey 2010). CTT‘s represent social movement organizations that typically serve as spokespersons and facilitators for conservative causes (Jacques et al. 2008; McCright and Dunlap 2000). While corporations like ExxonMobil have joined conservative foundations in providing generous funding for CTTs, many of the latter appear to oppose climate science and policy making for purely ideological reasons (McCright and Dunlap 2010: 109-11). CTT's are a fundamental and highly efective component of the denial machine, providing institutional bases for leading contrarians such as Patrick Michaels (a Cato Fellow), hosting anti-IPCC conferences (Heartland Institute), sponsoring ‘educational events‘ for politicians (National Center for Policy Analysis), assisting the George W. Bush Administration’s efforts to impede climate policy (Competitive Enterprise Institute), and producing and circulating a vast range of anti-climate change material via various forms of media (reports, press releases, press conferences, videos, radio and television interviews). among other activities (see e.g. Hoggan with Littlemore 2009; Lahsen 2008; McCright and Dunlap 2000, 2003; Oreskes and Conway 2010).</t>

    <t>C1: Cato and Big TobaccoPro's first claim is that Cato has received donations from 'Big Tobacco' and in return Pro alleges that the Institute tailored its content to reflect the interests of its donors. 1) The first problem with this assumption is that it fails to establish that Cato's content was substantially effected by the donations in question. He says that Cato accepted Big Tobacco donations ' and in turn jumping on the Big Tobacco bandwagon.' The earliest instance Pro cites of donations to Cato from 'Big Tobacco' like donors was in 1991. However, Cato from its inception (in 1974, 17 years before the first donation in question) has been an opponent of government action to curb non-aggressive individual activities. Things like smoking bans and corporate regulation are something Cato has always been opposed to, which would naturally put them somewhat in line with the interest of tobacco corporations. Pro needs to establish that Cato's content was posterior to the various donations and has failed to do so thus far.2) On Pro's examples, he fails to show that the content must be biased. For instance, Pro says Cato 'has challenged credible science that links second hand smoke exposure to death and disease and has organized opposition to smoke-free environments.' On the first claim, Pro doesn't offer any substantive evidence to back the claim up. On the second claim, opposing 'smoke-free environments' is incredibly vague. Is he referring to private residences and properties or is he referring to public places? The former is basic private propertarian ideology, something Cato supported before the 90's. The latter also needs backing up by Pro since he also failed to provide evidence supporting it.3) Pro's claim attempting to link the Cato Institute's opposition to the FDA is also misleading. Since the FDA's main function is to regulate the output of private industry and Cato from its inception has been a predominantly free market thing tank, it's natural that Cato would be opposed to it. Therefore Pro simply saying Cato has spent money writing against the FDA fails to prove anything.C2: Cato and Climate Change1) First, Pro's only claim is that Cato holds to a certain position without actually even attempting to show why it should discredit Cato. Let's go out on a limb and say Cato (as a monolithic entity I suppose) wholesale denies climate change (not just certain aspects or the prospect of government intervention). Why should this wholly discredit the organization? Cato isn't just a scientific institution. It also deals with topics dealing with a large range of policy issues. Let's say Cato is wrong on climate change. That still doesn't fulfill the rather large burden of proof Pro has assumed in attempting to discredit the entire organization.2) Pro has also been incredibly ambiguous on Cato's actual policy in regards to global climate change. He alludes several times to Cato's opposition to various State actions attempting to mitigate climate change but never actually mentions across the board beliefs of Cato scholars and writers. Of course I should repeat that Pro hasn't shown why denying certain aspects of global climate change should necessitate denying credibility to the institute.</t>

<h>I would like to thank jh1234l for this great debate. CO2 CorrelationFirst, what my opponent seems to fail to take into account, is that the Earth is in the middle of a 30-year cooling trend.  'Because PDO cycles last 25 to 30 years, Easterbrook expects the cooling trend to continue for another 2 decades or so.  Easterbrook, in fact, documents 40 such alternating periods of warming and cooling over the past 500 years, with similar data going back 15,000 years.  He further expects the flipping of the ADO to add to the current downward trend.'[1]Then why was 2010 the hottest year ever?'The 'hottest year' claims confirm the case for political science overtaking climate science. The “hottest year” claim depends on minute fractions of a degree difference between years. Even NASA's James Hansen, the leading proponent of man-made global warming in the U.S., conceded the 'hottest year' rankings are essentially meaningless. Hansen explained that 2010 differed from 2005 by less than 2 hundredths of a degree F (that's 0.018F).'[2]'There has now been no net warming since 1997 -15 years with CO2 rising with no global temperature increase. Since 2003, the trend is negative.'[3]And a graph:  [4]Second, my opponent provides this way out of whack graph, even though I have posted many graphs accurately showing the correlation between solar activity and temperature. I'm not to be mean and provide a new argument, so I will simply leave the audience with something to consider: Remember the laws of thermodynamics. Even if the sun's activity has leveled off, there will still be increases in temperature for a short while because the sun is still producing more energy. Sun      For my opponent's first point, I would like to thank him for conceding that the sun's activity is decreasing also, further supporting the conclusion that the Earth is cooling, which I mentioned above. Also, this further disproves the idea of CO2 causing global warming becuase CO2 concentrations are continuing to go up exponentially. (Also, I realize this might be in contradiction with my earlier point, but I encourage readers to look at overall levels, and the fact that the MWP was longer than this time's warming). As for my opponent's second point, he hasn't proven anything wrong because your graph doesn't show correlation at all. In addition, he drops ALL the other stellar data I provided in the last round.     Cosmic Rays My opponent has provided no rebuttal to my cosmic ray point; all he has done is make another claim about CO2's causation of the current warming. I will simply provide a short rebuttal and a graph.     [5]There is clearly not that much correlation, especially today when temperatures are decreasing.Now on to a research paper on the topic:The highlights of the paper are:  ► Changes in global atmospheric CO2 are lagging about 11–12 months behind changes in global sea surface temperature, 9.5-10 months behind changes in global air surface temperature, and 9 months behind changes in global lower troposphere temperature. ► Changes in ocean temperatures appear to explain a substantial part of the observed changes in atmospheric CO2 since January 1980. ► CO2 released from use of fossil fuels have little influence on the observed changes in the amount of atmospheric CO2, and changes in atmospheric CO2 are not tracking changes in human emissions.[6]Once more, my opponent has failed to respond to my arguments on cosmic rays.   PDO/AMO  My opponent is claiming that I have not provided a '10 year correlation record of PDO/AMO', although I'm sure I have in the numerous graphs and quotes I've made on this topic.I'll provide another graph:[7]As we can see, there is extremely large correlation, and that the sun spot number and climate is extremely correlated. And when broken into the last century, has a stronger correlation then CO2. PDO is also considered a large factor in the current warming, and its statistical correlation is extremely high and should never be considered unworthy as a component in warming [8].The facts where presented, the current correlation since 1880 was not strong enough to mean CO2 was a large factor, as it was under a .5 R correlation. The PDO (a natural forcing) had higher correlations by factors of two. Position in Galaxy  I would like to thank my opponent for presenting the whole quote, but it does not help his case one bit. My opponent can obviously not see that this was a point agreed upon by the creators of that article. Notice that 'militants' say, not ISIL. What ISIL says is: 'To put it another way, the amount of CO2 in our atmosphere is the result of changes in solar activity, not the cause of it. Climate change is natural, continuous, and caused by changes in solar emissions.'[9]Obviously, my opponent misread my quote. Now I will post the very last thing on cosmic rays: The following table sets out a comparison of the predictions of two climate theories - the CO2 warming theory and the Sun/Cosmic Ray theory - and actual real world data.

In other words, very reliable. I also provided ice core and tree ring data which are also very reliable. These are certainly worthy statistics and my opponent has dropped them. The Sun     I already countered all of this earlier.  Also, 'Temperatures have been increasing since 1980 faster than can be explained by the sunspot cycle length, indicating a possible human CO2 contribution. The recent increase of the cycle lengths explains why there has been no warming since 2002. Temperature changes are expected to follow Sun activity changes due to a time lag resulting from the large heat capacity of the oceans.'[10]Conclusion   'Just how much of the 'Greenhouse Effect' is caused by human activity?    It is about 0.28%. [11] Thanks again to my opponent for the debate. </h>

    <t>C1: Cato and Big Tobacco  1) Pro has changed his main argument from the thesis that Cato tailors it's content as a result of corporate donations to the thesis that the reason Cato exists originally is in order to forward corporate interests. An interesting idea I suppose but Pro offers no substantiation. Pro just says Cato is backed by corporations. But his new thesis (brought in the last round) requires evidence surrounding the genesis of Cato, not with current affairs so just saying that Cato has received corporate donations is insuficient to show that the basis of its inception was to forward corporate interests. This requires Pro to offer evidence concerning the motivations of Cato's founders, something Pro hasn't even attempted to do.  Pro also fails to offer a rebuttal to my point that the policy proposals of right-wing libertarianism would in some instances naturally coincide with those of corporations, meaning the argument fails to prove that Cato's policy proposals are a result of corporate donations as opposed to the ideological bent of the organization. Pro responds by saying that Cato claims to be an independent organization which he claims is false. But why does he say this? Because their interests naturally coincide at some points with corporations. Even so this doesn't prove that Cato isn't independent since Pro hasn't established a causal link from the interests of corporations to the content of Cato. Otherwise it's just a natural coincidence of interests.  2) Pro still hasn't shown why Cato's claims are biased or false. He's just shown that there is opposition. However, even if he shows Cato to be wrong, this doesn't prove corporate-backed bias. Pro also elucidated on his smoking bans point in saying he was referring to public-place smoking bans. Of course, Pro still fails to offer substantiation on why this is (a) wrong, (b) necessarily a result of corporate interests, or (c) why even if it is wrong, why it warrants withdrawing credibility from an entire organization.  3) Pro still hasn't shown why opposition to the FDA or other regulator institutions must be the result of corporate influence and cannot be explained by the ideological bent of the organization since its genesis. See a more full refutation in Point 1 of C1.  C2: Cato and Climate Change  1) Pro fails to adequately respond to my point. Basically, Pro is saying that Cato scholars have a different opinion on climate change than him. Therefore they are undeserving of respect. Pro makes this claim without actually establishing why that should be the case. Now instead of backing up his claim in respect to the actual content of Cato's global climate change proposals, Pro is simply saying Cato makes its claims because of corporate donation. For full refutation of this see Point 1 of C1 above. Just because some third party has the same interests as X, doesn't mean X's actions must be the result of that third party. This is especially so in that Cato's ideological bent has been right wing libertarianism since its inception.  2) Pro's rebuttal here isn't actually a rebuttal at all. It's just more claims that conservative think tanks are generally biased. In failing to rebut my counter, Pro drops some important points. For instance, Pro hasn't shown which beliefs of Cato scholars are wrong or why if they are wrong, why that should destroy the credibility of an entire organization. Cato is a policy institute. Just saying that their policy proposals are wrong in one area doesn't show why wholesale loss of credibility is warranted. Of course Pro never attempted to show that their beliefs were wrong in this area so the point is moot I suppose.</t>

    <t>What is a greenhouse gas? Wikipedia says:  A greenhouse gas is a gas in an atmosphere that absorbs and emits radiation within the thermal infrared range. This process is the fundamental cause of the greenhouse effect. The primary greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere are water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. [1]  1. CO2 is increasing.  The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in Earth's atmosphere has reached 395 ppm (parts per million) as of June 2012 and rose by 2.0 ppm/yr during 2000'2009. This current concentration is substantially higher than the 280 ppm concentration present before industrial times, with the increase largely attributed to anthropogenic sources. [2] The burning of fossil fuels has caused CO2 levels in the atmosphere to rise from 280 ppm to 397 ppm. [1]  2. Methane is increasing, too.  In 2010, methane levels in the Arctic was at 1850 nmol/mol, which is over twice as high as at any time in the 400,000 years before the industrial revolution. The Earth's atmospheric methane concentration has increased by about 150% since 1750, and it accounts for 20% of the total radiative forcing from all of the long-lived and globally mixed greenhouse gases (Excluding water vapour). [3]  3. Did the temperature rise? Statics say yes. The graph at [4] shows that it has risen by roughly 0.6 Degrees C. </t>

EDIT: Per Ron-Paul's request, the resolution is changed and the voting period is now 1 month.  My Starting Arguments:  Yes, the Earth is warming. Since the early 20th century, Earth's mean surface temperature has increased by about 0.8 'C (1.4 'F), with about two-thirds of the increase occurring since 1980.[1]  Is it caused mainly by humans? Humans have increased the amount of Co2, a greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases increase the Earth's temperature.  'Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the burning of fossil fuels has contributed to the increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from 280 ppm to 397 ppm, despite the uptake of a large portion of the emissions through various natural 'sinks' involved in the carbon cycle.'[2]  Plus, global warming could cause ice cap melting. Dan Miller said that the ice caps can be gone by 2020. </t>

    <t>I would like to thank jh1234l for challenging me to this debate. I will assume that the first round is for acceptance since my opponent put forth minimal arguments and the BoP is on him.</t>
<h>Thanks to Ron-Paul for the response.  CO2 Correlation  The sunspots actually rose after the temperature in 1960, according to the chart from [A]. If my opponent's claim is right, then global warming causes sunspots to rise, which is not the case. The chart from [A] shows a strong correlation between CO2 and temperature, in the short term without apparent lag.  Sun  'Sun - Recent Activity Highest in 8000 Years and magnetic field has decreased in size by 25%'  Again, my sun argument still stands. Predictions say that Solar Cycle 24 will have a peak sunspot number of 90, the lowest of any cycle since 1928 when Solar Cycle 16 peaked at 78. Right now, the solar cycle is in a valley--the deepest of the past century. In 2008 and 2009, the sun set Space Age records for low sunspot counts, weak solar wind, and low solar irradiance. The sun has gone more than two years without a significant solar flare. [B] The sun is not in a period of high activity.  'Also, by the way, since CO2 does not correlate with temperatures, your Pluto-to-Earth claim is fallacious.'  I have proven this wrong with [A].  Cosmic Rays  The most recent IPCC studies disputed the mechanism. The 2007 IPCC reports, however, strongly attribute a major role of anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the ongoing global warming, but as 'different climate changes in the past had different causes' a driving role of carbon dioxide in the geological past is neither focus of the IPCC nor purported. [C]  PDO/AMO  The 10-year correlation record of CO2 is on there, but the 10 year correlation record of PDO/AMO is not on there, therefore this does not prove that CO2 has less influence.  'There. Cosmic rays, the sun, and all the Earth's natural cycles have a .95 correlation. '  The PDO/AMO does not have a 10 year chart to compare with CO2, the sun is refuted in earlier rounds. The sunspots are lagging behind the temperature. IPCC disputes the cosmic rays and instead attribute the warming to CO2.  Position in galaxy (Only a chart given by opponent)  Per Ron-Paul's request, this is the full quote: (formatting changed for character count, no changes in content, words taken out in R3 are marked) ' To combat global warming, militants say we must all accept drastic reductions in our standard of living starting now, steadily increasing year-after-year, until much of industrial society is swept away. Only thus can the earth, and perhaps mankind, be saved. [[To achieve this radical restructuring of human society, global warming proponents demand that we give virtually unlimited power to government to control what we eat, how we travel, and how our industries operate, with no dissent or resistance permitted.]] Cars, jet travel for the public, air conditioning, refrigeration, and indeed many if not most of the conveniences of modern life will simply have to be abolished, as quickly as politically feasible. As one environmental activist puts it, Everything modern has to go!' -ISIL  Medieval Warm Period  'I will keep coming with more. There is a clear correlation.' There is no correlation if you give nothing to compare.  The data before 1600 was scarce [D], which means that the temperatures can be colder or warmer than now, but the chart at [E] shows that the MWP is colder than the temperature at 2004.  The Sun  Back in 2008, the solar cycle plunged into the deepest minimum in nearly a century. Sunspots all but vanished, solar flares subsided, and the sun was eerily quiet. As 2011 unfolds, sunspots have returned and they are crackling with activity. On February 15th and again on March 9th, Earth orbiting satellites detected a pair of 'X-class' solar flares--the most powerful kind of x-ray flare. The last such eruption occurred back in December 2006. [F]  As you can see, the solar activity was unstable. Then we should see many huge dips and rises in the chart at http://ossfoundation.us... , but the sun spots dipped down in 2000, while the temperature still rose with the CO2 with little to none delays on the CO2 part. CO2 correlates more than sun spots on [A]. And [A] is a short term graph from 1860 to 2000, so the CO2 should be delayed like crazy, right? Nope, that is not the case.  In Conclusion, my opponent's claims have been refuted.</h>

    <t>I would like to thank jh1234l for this great debate. CO2 CorrelationFirst, what my opponent seems to fail to take into account, is that the Earth is in the middle of a 30-year cooling trend.  'Because PDO cycles last 25 to 30 years, Easterbrook expects the cooling trend to continue for another 2 decades or so.  Easterbrook, in fact, documents 40 such alternating periods of warming and cooling over the past 500 years, with similar data going back 15,000 years.  He further expects the flipping of the ADO to add to the current downward trend.'[1]Then why was 2010 the hottest year ever?'The 'hottest year' claims confirm the case for political science overtaking climate science. The “hottest year” claim depends on minute fractions of a degree difference between years. Even NASA's James Hansen, the leading proponent of man-made global warming in the U.S., conceded the 'hottest year' rankings are essentially meaningless. Hansen explained that 2010 differed from 2005 by less than 2 hundredths of a degree F (that's 0.018F).'[2]'There has now been no net warming since 1997 -15 years with CO2 rising with no global temperature increase. Since 2003, the trend is negative.'[3]And a graph:  [4]Second, my opponent provides this way out of whack graph, even though I have posted many graphs accurately showing the correlation between solar activity and temperature. I'm not to be mean and provide a new argument, so I will simply leave the audience with something to consider: Remember the laws of thermodynamics. Even if the sun's activity has leveled off, there will still be increases in temperature for a short while because the sun is still producing more energy. Sun      For my opponent's first point, I would like to thank him for conceding that the sun's activity is decreasing also, further supporting the conclusion that the Earth is cooling, which I mentioned above. Also, this further disproves the idea of CO2 causing global warming becuase CO2 concentrations are continuing to go up exponentially. (Also, I realize this might be in contradiction with my earlier point, but I encourage readers to look at overall levels, and the fact that the MWP was longer than this time's warming). As for my opponent's second point, he hasn't proven anything wrong because your graph doesn't show correlation at all. In addition, he drops ALL the other stellar data I provided in the last round.     Cosmic Rays My opponent has provided no rebuttal to my cosmic ray point; all he has done is make another claim about CO2's causation of the current warming. I will simply provide a short rebuttal and a graph.     [5]There is clearly not that much correlation, especially today when temperatures are decreasing.Now on to a research paper on the topic:The highlights of the paper are:  ► Changes in global atmospheric CO2 are lagging about 11–12 months behind changes in global sea surface temperature, 9.5-10 months behind changes in global air surface temperature, and 9 months behind changes in global lower troposphere temperature. ► Changes in ocean temperatures appear to explain a substantial part of the observed changes in atmospheric CO2 since January 1980. ► CO2 released from use of fossil fuels have little influence on the observed changes in the amount of atmospheric CO2, and changes in atmospheric CO2 are not tracking changes in human emissions.[6]Once more, my opponent has failed to respond to my arguments on cosmic rays.

And when broken into the last century, has a stronger correlation then CO2. PDO is also considered a large factor in the current warming, and its statistical correlation is extremely high and should never be considered unworthy as a component in warming [8].The facts where presented, the current correlation since 1880 was not strong enough to mean CO2 was a large factor, as it was under a .5 R correlation.

    <t>I would like to thank jh12341 for presenting his arguments. My opponent posts a very convincing graph to his argument, until you look at it closer, you find that there is about a 1000-year lag that shows CO2 pratically a millenium behind temperature. '...the CO2 changes have lagged about 800 years behind the temperuatre changes. Global warming has produced more CO2, rather than more CO2 producing global warming.'[1] My opponent uses an extremely zoomed out graph, making it hard to see this. However, I will make it easier for everyone and show the last 11000 years of CO2 history:[2]'In fact, the air's CO2 content did not begin to rise until 400 to 1,000 years after the planet began to warm. Ice cores provide a detailed record of local temperature and CO2 concentrations. A study finds that the CO2 increase lagged Antarctic deglacial warming by 800 +/- 200 years. CO2 does not seem to be following that well.'[3]Then, my opponent claims that there has been warming from 1940-1970. However, two simple things will counter this. One, 'In spite of rhetoric to the contrary, the majority of this warming took place naturally before 1940. This warming trend was interrupted by a 35-year cooling period from 1940 to 1975.'[4] And a graph:  [5]As can be easily seen from the graph, there was a 0.2 C degree drop in global temperature anomalies from 1942 till 1977.     The Rest of the Solar System  I can happily post more evidence of this.Here are some solar system wide effects:  Sun - 'Recent Activity Highest in 8000 Years [meaning it's not just the 11-year cycle] and'magnetic field has decreased in size by 25% 300% increase in galactic dust entering solar system Mercury - magnetosphere experiencing significant increases Venus  - 2500% Increase in Green Glow Mars - Rapid Appearance of Clouds, Ozone and'Up to 50% Erosion of Ice Features in one year alone Jupiter - Plasma Torus increasing and'Jupiter's Disappearance of White Ovals since 1997 ' recent increase in storms Io - 'observing same changes -' 200% Increase in Density of Plasma Torus and Ionosphere 1000% Higher Europa - Much Brighter Than Expected Ganymede - 200% brighter Saturn's - Plasma Torus 1000% Denser and'Aurora First Seen in polar regions in recent years Uranus - featureless in 1996, now exhibiting huge storms since 1999 and markedly brighter in 2004 than in 1999 Neptune - 40% Brighter, Near Infrared Range ' 1996 ' 2002 Triton - Severe atmospheric changes, warming Pluto - 300% increase in atmospheric pressure.  You can't be telling me all of this is a coincidence. Also, by the way, since CO2 does not correlate with temperatures, your Pluto-to-Earth claim is fallacious.'[6] So, there are also many other bodies being affected.  Earthly Causes  For my cosmic ray quote, you have to understand that there are many factors affecting the Earth's climate: ocean currents, climatic cycles, etc... However, it is easy to spot the correlation, isn't it?[3]There is a very good fit. Cosmic rays inversly correlate with temperature. In addition to this,   [7]Cosmic rays inversly correlate with sunspots and low clouds (which both produce warming).Low clouds means warmer temperatures: 'Cloud cover has decreased over the past 39 years globally, and temperatures have risen during that time. This global decrease in cloud cover alone could account for all surface warming observed since the 1970s.'[8]Putting this all together, 'For example, the authors of a paper by NASA's JPL remark '...has compared the minimum aa [index of geomagnetic activity] values with the Earth's surface temperature record and found a correlation of 0.95 between the two data sets starting in 1885. The solar irradiance [solar activity] proxy developed from the aa minima continues to track the Earth's surface temperature until the present.''[9]There. Cosmic rays, the sun, and all the Earth's natural cycles have a .95 correlation.  For my PDO/AMO quote, I'm not sure what my opponent is trying to say and ask him to clarify.The Position In Galaxy and Cosmic RaysFirst, my opponent could have posted the entire quote. He only used ~3500 characters for his whole R3 argument with a 8000 character limit. Please post the whole thing and I will evaluate it in R5.Second, my opponent misinterprets my graph. I said earlier that the top chart was, 'The lower panel shows the match achieved by removing El Nino, the North Atlantic Oscillation, volcanic aerosols and a linear trend of 0.14 Celsius/decade.' The bottom chart is the more useful (and more accurate) way to isolate cosmic rays, and lo and behold, there is a correlation for that time.As if I haven't posted enough to convince you of cosmic ray's effect on temperature, I will post one more graph:    [10]Finally, I already refuted my opponent's last point. Medieval Warm Period  There is ample evidence that the Medieval Warm Period and Holocene Climate Maximum were hotter than today:'Chinese temperatures were 2 to 3 degrees C higher than present during China's climate optimum.''...during the Medieval Warming... . Temperatures may have been as much as 2.5 degrees C warmer [than today] due to a southward shift of the climate belts.''...the central Argentinean area had more precipitation during the Medieval Warming than today. Temperatures may have been as much as 2.5 degrees C warmer due to a southward shift of the tropical rainbelts.''The largest anomaly was a rapid warming-4 degrees C-between 350 B.C and A.D 450, reflecting a warmer climate in equatorial East Africa.''On Signy Island, halfway between Antarctica and the southern tip of South America, there clearly shows the Roman Warming..., the Dark Ages [cooling]..., the Medieval Warming, the Little Ice Age, and the 20th century warming-which is cooler to date than the Medieval Warming.'[1]I will keep coming with more. There is a clear correlation.'Indirect evidence suggests that the average temperature was as much as 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer [during the Medieval Warm Period] than today.'[11]Also, a graph:[12]Clearly, there were many times warmer than today.The Sun   First, solar activity is still increasing, even with the sunspots. It is a general trend up.Second, I already refuted the CO2 connection.I will post a some graphs to help visualize this:      [13] Which one correlates better?  [3] Longer term, here is a correlation of a solar proxy to a temperature proxy for a period of 3000 years. Values of carbon-14 (produced by cosmic rays, hence a proxy for solar activity) correlate extremely well with oxygen-18 (temperature proxy).  The lower graph shows a particularly well-resolved time interval from 8,350 to 7,900 years BP.  The above graph summarizes data obtained from a stalagmite from a cave in Oman.  [3] Good correspondence between temperature and solar irradiance proxy reconstructions as shown on the graph above.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank jh12341 for presenting his arguments. I. The Universe and Global WarmingThe current state of the Galaxy and our Sun is affecting our temperatures.I.i. The Rest of the Solar SystemThe Sun clearly is in a warmer phase, because all of the other planets have increasing temperatures as well. 'In 2005 data from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor and Odyssey missions revealed that the carbon dioxide 'ice caps' near Mars's south pole had been diminishing for three summers in a row.Habibullo Abdussamatov, head of space research at St. Petersburg's Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory in Russia, says the Mars data is evidence that the current global warming on Earth is being caused by changes in the sun.'[1]''Global warming on Neptune's moon Triton as well as Jupiter and Pluto, and now Mars has some [scientists] scratching their heads over what could possibly be in common with the warming of all these planets … Could there be something in common with all the planets in our solar system that might cause them all to warm at the same time?''[2] Two things can be drawn from this. One, that if other planets are warming, that it is only natural for the Earth to be warming as well. And second, that even if all these planets did have natural causes, then that is a sign of Earth's natural climatic change, instead of man-made. I.ii. The Position of the Milky Way GalaxyEvery approximately 135 million years, Earth enters a more populated area of the Milky Way, and as a result, more cosmic rays hit the Earth, which causes cooling. Currently, we are in a less populated area of the Milky Way, which means that less of these cosmic rays will be hitting the Earth, which means less cloud formation, and of course, warming. [3] for the source on this hypothesis. The sun can also cause this through evaporation.II. Earthly CausesThere are many internal causes of Global Warming as well. II.i. Ocean Current Anomalies Ocean temperature anomalies seem to be rising-along with the temperature. '...one can model past temperatures as a linear trend (that started well before CO2 was added in any substantial quantity) and periodic bumps... ...temperatures over the last 100+ years look a lot like a linear trend plus ocean cycle-driven bumps'[4] What is causing all the bumps?:  [4]As shown in the graph, the PDO, or ocean currents, temperature has affected the average Earth's temperature.    II.ii. Clouds: A Continuation of Point I.ii.I mentioned about the position of the Milky Way Galaxy and the Sun in regards to these 'cosmic rays'. Here is a more in depth look at the effects of position. 'The implications, if true, had potentially enormous implications for the debate about natural causes of warming. When the sun is very active, it can be thought of as pushing away cosmic rays from the Earth, reducing their incidence. When the sun is less active, we see more cosmic rays. This is fairly well understood. But if Svensmark was correct, it would mean that periods of high solar output should coincide with reduced cloud formation (due to reduced cosmic race incidence), which in turn would have a warming effect on the Earth, since less sunlight would be reflected back into space before hitting the Earth.Here was a theory, then, that would increase the theoretical impact on climate of an active sun, and better explain why solar irradiance changes might be underestimating the effect of solar output changes on climate and temperatures.'[4]'Since he first suggested his hypothesis over a decade and a half ago, Svensmark and other researchers have slowly been putting together research to test it.' The results were: 'Scientists found that when shielding was removed and natural cosmic rays allowed to hit the chamber, cloud seeding increased dramatically, and it increased substantially again when additional artificial cosmic rays were added. Svensmark appears to have gotten it right.'[5] Proof here is in the next points. III. The 1500-Year Cycle This has to do with a cycle of the climate that can explain the warming. 'Through at least the last million years, a moderate 1500-year warm-cold cycle has been superimposed over the longer, stronger Ice Ages and warm interglacials.'[6]  Here is a graph related to this:     [7]There are two things we can conclude from this graph. First, that up-and-down cycles are normal for the long-term climate. This century's global warming is nothing new. The second thing we can conclude, is that today's global warming is not as bad as the Medieval Warm Period's peak yet, and the Medieval Warm Period was less than the Holocene Maximum Period.    'Even more important, the earth is not 'the warmest it has ever been.' In fact, the earth was much warmer during the Medieval Warm Period when human agriculture flourished!'[7]'The scientists found evidence that on average, every 1,470 years, plus or minus 500 years, cold, ice-bearing waters, which today circulate around southern Greenland, pushed as far south as Great Britain.'[8] There seems to be a full cycle of up-down-up temperatures of the climate every 1470 years. And this goes as far back as at least 1 million years ago. Currently, we are in an upswing of temperatures, just coming off of the Little Ice Age, the peak to be in a few hundred years, making the peak-to-peak difference between today's global warming and the Medieval Warm Period a little less than 1500 years. So today's Global Warming is a natural, cyclical occurence.    IV. The Sun: The Proof of Theories I.ii and II.iiThe sun's cycles have a lot to do with temperatures also.  'In this chamber, 63 CERN scientists from 17 European and American institutes have done what global warming doomsayers said could never be done — demonstrate that cosmic rays promote the formation of molecules that in Earth’s atmosphere can grow and seed clouds, the cloudier and thus cooler it will be. Because the sun’s magnetic field controls how many cosmic rays reach Earth’s atmosphere (the stronger the sun’s magnetic field, the more it shields Earth from incoming cosmic rays from space), the sun determines the temperature on Earth.'[9]'Svensmark matched the data on cosmic rays from the neutron monitor in Climax, Colorado, with the satellite measurements of solar irradiance from 1970 to 1990. Over the period between 1975 and 1989, he found cosmic rays decreased by 1.2 percent annually, amplifying the sun's change in irradiance about four-fold'[6]So, as the sun's activity increases, so does the temperature. This below graph shows the correlation:   [10]This graph clearly shows that temperature goes up and down with solar activity, because an increase in solar activity directly correlates with an increase in average temperature 1-2 years later. And as a final side note, I would like to present this graph that helps disprove the anthropogenic cause theory, regarding again, natural cycles:  [4] So 'nature' created the same temperature trend as 'humans' did. Hmmm. </t>

    <t>I would like to thank jh1234l for his response.First, I will refute my opponent's arguments, and then I will defend my own.My opponent hasn't given any proof to his arguments. He shows that temperatures have increased, that CO2 concentrations have increased, and that the latter is caused by humans. However, he has failed to provide any correlation between CO2 and temperature; meaning that he has not proven how CO2 causes temperature increases. I will respond in more detail when my opponent posts fuller arguments, but I will make a small comment here:'In the last decade, there has been no clear warming trend (as the UK Met Office and IPCC’s own figures demonstrate). In the last century, much of the warming occurred prior to 1940, when human emissions of CO2 were relatively small compared to today. During the post-war economic boom (when one would have expected the temperature to rise) the world cooled, from the 1940s till the mid-70s (again, this is evident from accepted data used by the IPCC).'[1]     [2]As shown, CO2 does not correlate with temperatures that well. I will now wait for my opponent to respond to his fallacy and my small argument.Now on to defending my arguments. I. The Universe and Global WarmingI.i. The rest of the Solar System  I'll get to cosmic rays later for the Mars part, but my opponent has failed to respond to my second source on this. I'll post more:'...it was noted the planet [Mars] was experiencing rapid warming, similar to what the Earth is currently undergoing.... The Martian icecaps are melting at a perilous pace.... ...and that both [warmings on Earth and Mars] can be explained by changes in solar irradiance.'[3]'Global warming was detected on Jupiter last year, and the warming is apparently behind the formation of a second red spot. Global warming on Neptune's moon Triton has also been noted, with severe atmospheric changes as a result. And even tiny Pluto has experienced moderate warming in recent years, with temperatures rising a full 3.5 degrees. The common denominator in all these cases, the Earth included, is of course the Sun, which is in the middle of an extremely active period at present.'[3]So yes, all of these bodies are indeed warming, and it can all be attributed to increases in solar irradiance.I.ii. The Position of the Milky Way GalaxyMy opponent has also failed to adequately respond to this. Again, I will cover this in more detail when I get to cosmic rays. II. Earthly Causes  II.i. Ocean Current Anomalies  When examining the temperature and CO2 data, the correlation is striking. CO2 only correlates on a .44 scale (r = .44). This means the correlation rates from “fair” to “poor”, which is bad news for an alarmist. It shows the correlation is not very strong. The correlation between the two main ocean currents, PDO and AMO, is particularly striking. The correlation is .83, the paper argues the correlation is in the “good” range, showing promise for this factor in the modern warming. It also shows its R2 is stronger then the CO2 correlation by a factor of almost two. The scientific paper then examines data within the last ten years, the results? A CO2 correlation is no match at all. The correlation is only 0.02. (r = 0.02). If CO2 was the main driver of climate, then why isn’t the correlation higher in the past century, and so low within the last decade?[4][5]This can show the real correlation:   [4]II.ii. Clouds My opponent has not responded to this argument.  So, on cosmic rays, my opponent has not refuted the correlation between them, the fact that cosmic rays cause more cloud formation, or the fact that cosmic rays mean less solar radiation. He has dropped the whole argument. You can easily see the direct correlation between cosmic rays and temperature: 'The graph below shows a correlation between the cosmic ray counts and the global troposphere temperature radiosonde data. The cosmic ray scale is inverted to correspond to increasing temperatures. High solar activity corresponds to low cosmic ray counts, reduced low cloud cover, and higher temperatures. The upper panel shows the troposphere temperatures in blue and the cosmic ray count in red. The lower panel shows the match achieved by removing El Nino, the North Atlantic Oscillation, volcanic aerosols and a linear trend of 0.14 Celsius/decade.'[2]. And the graph:  [2]III. The 1500-Year CycleMy opponent has also failed to respond to this argument adequately. He first attacks the ISIL, even though they are a respectable organization, then he proceeds to take a quote from it out of context, and finally concludes with an irrelevant quote. If my opponent wants more information: 'These are the Medieval Warm Period, which is  well known, but also a period during the toga-wearing Roman times when  temperatures were apparently 1 deg C warmer than now.'[6] This is backed up by tree ring research.'Indirect evidence suggests that the average temperature was as much as 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than today.'[7]And another graph:    [8] IV. The Sun My opponent yet again fails to respond to my argument. It is not refuted in his I.ii.  Some more info on the topic:'Changes in the Sun can account for major climate changes on Earth for the past 300 years, including part of the recent surge of global warming, 300 years, including part of the recent surge of global warming'[9]And another graph showing sunspot count (the higher the sunspot count, the greater the solar activity) versus climate. Pretty good correlation:     [8] I encourage my opponent to actually try and counter my arguments instead of committing logical fallacies and red herrings.

    <t>Thanks to Ron-Paul for the response.  CO2 Correlation  The sunspots actually rose after the temperature in 1960, according to the chart from [A]. If my opponent's claim is right, then global warming causes sunspots to rise, which is not the case. The chart from [A] shows a strong correlation between CO2 and temperature, in the short term without apparent lag.  Sun  'Sun - Recent Activity Highest in 8000 Years and magnetic field has decreased in size by 25%'  Again, my sun argument still stands. Predictions say that Solar Cycle 24 will have a peak sunspot number of 90, the lowest of any cycle since 1928 when Solar Cycle 16 peaked at 78. Right now, the solar cycle is in a valley--the deepest of the past century. In 2008 and 2009, the sun set Space Age records for low sunspot counts, weak solar wind, and low solar irradiance. The sun has gone more than two years without a significant solar flare. [B] The sun is not in a period of high activity.  'Also, by the way, since CO2 does not correlate with temperatures, your Pluto-to-Earth claim is fallacious.'  I have proven this wrong with [A].  Cosmic Rays  The most recent IPCC studies disputed the mechanism. The 2007 IPCC reports, however, strongly attribute a major role of anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the ongoing global warming, but as 'different climate changes in the past had different causes' a driving role of carbon dioxide in the geological past is neither focus of the IPCC nor purported. [C]  PDO/AMO  The 10-year correlation record of CO2 is on there, but the 10 year correlation record of PDO/AMO is not on there, therefore this does not prove that CO2 has less influence.  'There. Cosmic rays, the sun, and all the Earth's natural cycles have a .95 correlation. '  The PDO/AMO does not have a 10 year chart to compare with CO2, the sun is refuted in earlier rounds. The sunspots are lagging behind the temperature. IPCC disputes the cosmic rays and instead attribute the warming to CO2.  Position in galaxy (Only a chart given by opponent)  Per Ron-Paul's request, this is the full quote: (formatting changed for character count, no changes in content, words taken out in R3 are marked) ' To combat global warming, militants say we must all accept drastic reductions in our standard of living starting now, steadily increasing year-after-year, until much of industrial society is swept away. Only thus can the earth, and perhaps mankind, be saved. [[To achieve this radical restructuring of human society, global warming proponents demand that we give virtually unlimited power to government to control what we eat, how we travel, and how our industries operate, with no dissent or resistance permitted.]] Cars, jet travel for the public, air conditioning, refrigeration, and indeed many if not most of the conveniences of modern life will simply have to be abolished, as quickly as politically feasible. As one environmental activist puts it, Everything modern has to go!' -ISIL  Medieval Warm Period  'I will keep coming with more. There is a clear correlation.' There is no correlation if you give nothing to compare.  The data before 1600 was scarce [D], which means that the temperatures can be colder or warmer than now, but the chart at [E] shows that the MWP is colder than the temperature at 2004.  The Sun  Back in 2008, the solar cycle plunged into the deepest minimum in nearly a century. Sunspots all but vanished, solar flares subsided, and the sun was eerily quiet. As 2011 unfolds, sunspots have returned and they are crackling with activity. On February 15th and again on March 9th, Earth orbiting satellites detected a pair of 'X-class' solar flares--the most powerful kind of x-ray flare. The last such eruption occurred back in December 2006. [F]  As you can see, the solar activity was unstable. Then we should see many huge dips and rises in the chart at, but the sun spots dipped down in 2000, while the temperature still rose with the CO2 with little to none delays on the CO2 part. CO2 correlates more than sun spots on [A]. And [A] is a short term graph from 1860 to 2000, so the CO2 should be delayed like crazy, right? Nope, that is not the case.

    <t>Thanks to Ron-Paul for a well written response.  Correlation between CO2 and Temperature  The records have shown strong correlations between climate and CO2 levels, as seen in the graph at [1].  'The world cooled from 1940-1970.'  Your source for this is not accurate, and is shown to be a misrepresentation of temperature records.[2] As shown, CO2 does correlate to the temperature records, so this argument is refuted.  I.i The Rest of The Solar System  The warming on Mars can be caused by reasons other than the Sun. Jeffery Plaut, a scientist from NASA, said 'It's believed that what drives climate change on Mars are orbital variations, the Earth also goes through orbital variations similar to that of Mars.'[3] The warming on Triton, could be the result of an extreme southern summer on the moon, a season that occurs every few hundred years, as well as possible changes in the makeup of surface ice that caused it to absorb more of the Sun's heat. [3] As you can see, there are other possible explanations for this, not just the sun.  Earthly Causes  'When examining the temperature and CO2 data, the correlation is striking. CO2 only correlates on a .44 scale (r = .44). This means the correlation rates from 'fair' to 'poor', which is bad news for an alarmist. It shows the correlation is not very strong.'  The cosmic rays only correlate at an 0.31-0.47, as stated by you, but anyways I'll go on.  'The correlation between the two main ocean currents, PDO and AMO, is particularly striking. The correlation is .83, the paper argues the correlation is in the 'good' range, showing promise for this factor in the modern warming. It also shows its R2 is stronger then the CO2 correlation by a factor of almost two. The scientific paper then examines data within the last ten years, the results? A CO2 correlation is no match at all. The correlation is only 0.02. (r = 0.02). If CO2 was the main driver of climate, then why isn't the correlation higher in the past century, and so low within the last decade?'  The paper, however, did not give a 10 years for PDO and AMO, so there is no comparison. We need the 10-year for PDO and AMO for actual comparison.  The Position In Galaxy amp; Cosmic Rays  First, I have not taken the quote out of context, only shortened it for the word limit. Anyways, I'll continue. If you look at my edited version at [4], you will see that it doesn't correlate much. Plus, the lower chart removed the linear trend (Caused by CO2 increases, possibly, as CO2 does correlate to the climate [1] and it increased by 2 ppm/yr from 2000-2009[5]), causing it to look more 'correlated', which is just a result of editing.  Medieval Warm Period  This period has very little temperature records, and the temperature may be below the temperature now. Wikipedia said that despite substantial uncertainties, the warmest period of the last 2,000 years prior to the 20th century very likely occurred between 950 and 1100, but temperatures were probably between 0.1 'C and 0.2 'C below the 1961 to 1990 mean and significantly below the level shown by instrumental data after 1980. [6]  Sunspots  An international panel of experts led by NOAA and sponsored by NASA has released a new prediction for the next solar cycle. Solar Cycle 24 will peak, they say, in May 2013 with a below-average number of sunspots.[7] While there is not yet a definitive link between solar sunspot activity and global temperatures, the scientists conducting the solar activity study believe that global greenhouse gas emissions would prevent any possible cold snap.[8]  From this information, the globe should be cold now, but 2011 was the warmest La Ni'a year in the period from 1950 to 2011. </t>

    <t>Thanks to my opponent for a well written response.  I.i. The rest of the solar system  While fluctuations in solar activity can affect Earth's climate, the majority of climate scientists and astrophysicists agree that the sun is not to blame for the current and historically sudden uptick in global temperatures on Earth, which seems to be mostly created by humans. [1]  Abdussamatov blamed solar fluctuations for the attenuation of ice caps on Mars. However, these changes were likely not due to the Sun, but rather increases in atmospheric clouds or aerosols that reflected solar radiation back into space.[1]  Charles Long, a climate physicist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratories in Washington, says that Abdussamatov's idea is nonsense. [1]  I.ii. The Position of the Milky Way Galaxy  'Every approximately 135 million years, Earth enters a more populated area of the Milky Way, and as a result, more cosmic rays hit the Earth, which causes cooling.'  135 million years.  Wikipedia says: 'Global warming is the rise in the average temperature of Earth's atmosphere and oceans since the late 19th century and its projected continuation. Since the early 20th century, Earth's mean surface temperature has increased by about 0.8 'C (1.4 'F).'[2]  This was nowhere near 135 million years. How could this suddenly happen?  II. Earthly causes  I.i. Ocean Current Anomalies  'Ocean temperature anomalies seem to be rising-along with the temperature.'  The temperature of the ocean can also be affected by the CO2 and Methane levels, (Which I proved that were going up in the last round. ) as those warm the surface and air, won't it be plausible that the air is warming the oceans and not the other way around?  Plus, In the picture you posted, it DID affect the temperature, but it still was going up, which I proved was man made.  II.ii. Clouds: A Continuation of Point I.ii.  See my refutation on Point I.ii.  III. The 1500-Year Cycle  I.S.I.L. is not even a scientific organization at all. ' The International Society for Individual Liberty (ISIL) is an association of individuals and organizations dedicated to building a free and peaceful world, respect for individual rights and liberties, and an open and competitive economic system based on voluntary exchange and free trade. ISIL currently has members and representatives in over 100 countries.'3]  I.S.I.L. even said 'To combat global warming, militants say we must all accept drastic reductions in our standard of living starting now, steadily increasing year-after-year, until much of industrial society is swept away.

    <t>first of all let me proof that global warming is happening . The 10 indicators are:  Land surface air temperature as measured by weather stations. You know all those skeptic arguments about how the temperature record is biased by the urban heat island effect, badly-sited weather stations, dropped stations, and so on? This is the only indicator which suffers from all those problems. So if you're arguing with somebody who tries to frame the discussion as being about land surface air temperature, just remind them about the other nine indicators. Sea surface temperature. As with land temperatures, the longest record goes back to 1850 and the last decade is warmest. Air temperature over the oceans. Lower troposphere temperature as measured by satellites for around 50 years. By any of these measures, the 2000s was the warmest decade and each of the last three decades has been much warmer than the previous one. Ocean heat content, for which records go back over half a century. More than 90% of the extra heat from global warming is going into the oceans ' contributing to a rise in' Sea level. Tide gauge records go back to 1870, and sea level has risen at an accelerating rate. Specific humidity, which has risen in tandem with temperatures. Glaciers. 2009 was the 19th consecutive year in which there was a net loss of ice from glaciers worldwide. Northern Hemisphere snow cover, which has also decreased in recent decades. Perhaps the most dramatic change of all has been in Arctic sea ice. Satellite measurements are available back to 1979 and reliable shipping records back to 1953. September sea ice extent has shrunk by 35% since 1979. Science isn't like a house of cards, in that removing one line of evidence (eg. land surface air temperature) wouldn't cause the whole edifice of anthropogenic global warming to collapse. Rather, 'land surface warming' is one of more than ten bricks supporting 'global warming'; and with global warming established, there is a whole other set of bricks supporting 'anthropogenic global warming'. To undermine these conclusions, you'd need to remove most or all of the bricks supporting them ' but as the evidence continues to pile up, that is becoming less and less likely.  now global warming is caused by humans , proofs are - 1.Humans are currently emitting around 30 billion tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere every year (CDIAC). Of course, it could be coincidence that CO2 levels are rising so sharply at the same time so let's look at more evidence that we're responsible for the rise in CO2 levels. When we measure the type of carbon accumulating in the atmosphere, we observe more of the type of carbon that comes from fossil fuels (Manning 2006). This is corroborated by measurements of oxygen in the atmosphere. Oxygen levels are falling in line with the amount of carbon dioxide rising, just as you'd expect from fossil fuel burning which takes oxygen out of the air to create carbon dioxide (Manning 2006). Further independent evidence that humans are raising CO2 levels comes from measurements of carbon found in coral records going back several centuries. These find a recent sharp rise in the type of carbon that comes from fossil fuels (Pelejero 2005). So we know humans are raising CO2 levels. What's the effect? Satellites measure less heat escaping out to space, at the particular wavelengths that CO2 absorbs heat, thus finding 'direct experimental evidence for a significant increase in the Earth's greenhouse effect'. (Harries 2001, Griggs 2004, Chen 2007). If less heat is escaping to space, where is it going? Back to the Earth's surface. Surface measurements confirm this, observing more downward infrared radiation (Philipona 2004,Wang 2009). A closer look at the downward radiation finds more heat returning at CO2 wavelengths, leading to the conclusion that 'this experimental data should effectively end the argument by skeptics that no experimental evidence exists for the connection between greenhouse gas increases in the atmosphere and global warming.' (Evans 2006). If an increased greenhouse effect is causing global warming, we should see certain patterns in the warming. For example, the planet should warm faster at night than during the day. This is indeed being observed (Braganza 2004, Alexander 2006). Another distinctive pattern of greenhouse warming is cooling in the upper atmosphere, otherwise known as the stratosphere. This is exactly what's happening (Jones 2003). With the lower atmosphere (the troposphere) warming and the upper atmosphere (the stratosphere) cooling, another consequence is the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere, otherwise known as the tropopause, should rise as a consequence of greenhouse warming. This has been observed (Santer 2003). An even higher layer of the atmosphere, the ionosphere, is expected to cool and contract in response to greenhouse warming. This has been observed by satellites (La'tovi?ka 2006).</t>

    <t>Scientists have concluded that most of the observed warming is very likely due to the burning of coal, oil, and gas. This conclusion is based on a detailed understanding of the atmospheric greenhouse effect and how human activities have been tweaking it. At the same time, other reasonable explanations, most notably changes in the Sun, have been ruled out.  The atmospheric greenhouse effect naturally keeps our planet warm enough to be livable. Sunlight passes through the atmosphere. Light-colored surfaces, such as clouds or ice caps, radiate some heat back into space. But most of the incoming heat warms the planet's surface. The Earth then radiates some heat back into the atmosphere. Some of that heat is trapped by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide (CO2). Human activity--such as burning fossil fuels--causes more greenhouse gases to build up in the atmosphere. As the atmosphere 'thickens' with more greenhouse gases, more heat is held in. Fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas are high in carbon and, when burned, produce major amounts of carbon dioxide or CO2. A single gallon of gasoline, when burned, puts 19 pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</t>

    <t>Hello Woojin05. I accept your challenge and look forward to our debate and the rounds that will follow! Here we go...  Global Warming is a reality, a problem and our fault. According to the Inquisitition of Climate Science, since 1800, 330 billion tons of Carbon Dioxide have been pumped into the atmosphere due to factories burning fossil fuels creating a 'greenhouse effect,' trapping sunlight, raising temperatures. This is also the cause for the largest global temperature increase mankind has ever encountered. According to the National Climatic Data Center, in the last century the average temperature has increased 1.33 degrees, and is projected to increase another 2.5-10.4 degrees by 21-hundred. The Institute for Demographic Research predicts that this temperature increase would raise ocean levels to the point where 634 million people living on the coast would be forced to re-locate. It is for this reason, that I support the resolution that Resolved: Developed countries have a moral obligation to mitigate the effects of Climate Change. As my first contention, I would like to raise the issue about who is in fact responsible for global warming. According to the World Resources Institue, 'industrialized countries account for roughly 80% of the carbon dioxide buildup in the atmosphere to date'. Industrialized countries. Not underdeveloped countries. There is additional evidence to support this. Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide tend to stay in the atmosphere for decades. Old injuries dealt to the enviorment from now developed countries' haven't healed yet. A study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development shows that the countries with the top annual carbon pollution per capita, are all industrialized and developed. Therefore it is developed countries that are responsible for global warming, and from the moral standpoint that this preposition wishes for us to take, it is developed countries who are responsible for mitigating the effects of climate change. It is essential to understand that climate change can be fixed. According to Royters, we have until 2040 to stop global warming before it becomes irreversible. There is a way to save our planet. However this solution is so obvious that it is often overlooked. Cutting pollution emissions by 80%, and replacing them with natural energy would literally halt the growth of climate change, which would end all effects of climate change. Admittedly, this solution comes with a high price tag. It could cost 1.9 trillion dollars annually to cut our carbon emissions by 80%. However this price tag is nothing compared to the cost of letting global warming continue. According to the Natural Resource Defense Council it is estimated that dealing with the effects of global warming would cost 20 trillion dollars a year by the end of the century, costing 10x more money than it would to just stop global warming. Each of the top 30 developed countries, have the budget to pay for approximently 4 % of the emissions decrease. This money could be funded by tax increases, charities, or budget cuts. In contrast there is mathematically no possible way of dealing with the effects of global warming without bankrupting the world's economy. Now the logical question is: Why can't developing countries assist in the costs of mitigating climate change? The answer is because they do not have the money. The average annual salary of a person living in a third world country is 730 dollars, or about 2 dollars a day. On top of this between 60-80% of this money is spent on food. There is no conceivable way a government could make money from taxing these people. As proof of this, the U.S.'s national budget is around 2.1 trillion dollars per year, whereas Zimbobwae's national budget is only 2.7 million dollars per year. Their budget is mathematically practically a millionth of the United States's budget, and Zimbobwae is an average third world country. These countries need every penny they can make, therefore they cannot be obligated to mitigate the effects of climate change. It's that simple. It is time to accept a reality and a responsibility. Therefore developed countries have a moral obligation to mitigate the effects of climate change.</t>

    <t>I will be using the social contract where a country only has an obligation to its self  'The EPA Has been funded highly in the last 10 years but has come up with little to no change to the environment what so ever' 2010 BBC Article  I stand in firm negation on the resolution, Resolved: Devloped Countries have a moral obligation to mitigate the effects of climate change.  My case is backed by two contentions: Developed countries already fund unsuccessful environmental programs  Contention 2: There are other issues that are a higher priority to developed.  On to my first contention, According to the Library of congress the EPA gets an annual budget of eight billion dollars a year, and rarely if ever come up with successful solutions to pollution or climate change. The BBC has reported multiple time of the success rate of the Epa and The british environmental conservation agency stating that both programs are failures and taxpayers should not be paying for them. As I have shown, developed countries have Environmental programs, countries like the USA, Britain , Canada, Australia, France,Spain and Portugal all have developed environmental programs, so countries have already accomplished the resolution. Also according to the British Environmental Conservation agency, climate change is only studied 3 months out of the 12 as stated by professor Martin Anthony of Cambridge university ' what is the point of studying climate climate change if there is no way to control it. So if there is no way to control climate change why should developed countries make it a priority. This brings me to my next contention: Developed Countries have higher priorities. NASA States that climate change is a natural occurrence and as Professor martin Anthony of Cambridge university stated that there is no way to control climate change. Why should climate change be so high on the agenda? It shouldn't, so the money used to fund these environmental agency's in developed country's can be used elsewhere, such as war effort, poverty and healthcare, the eight billion dollars that goes to the EPA can be used to minimize poverty, fund wars and fund healthcare. Climate change should not be a high priority in today agenda. In conclusion I have proven that Developed country's already have funded programs that involved in environmental study and that climate change is not a priority to developed countries. With that I urge a vote in negation on the resolution. Thank you</t>

    <t>For the purpose of this debate I propose the following definitions. Developed countries is a term used to identify the wealthiest nations in the world, which include Western Europe, the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. (ww Norton amp; co. economics textbook) Moral obligation is a duty arising out of considerations of right and wrong (Princeton University)  For our framework, we will be using utilitarianism, which is that actions should be directed toward promoting the greatest happiness of the greatest number of persons. Specifically, according to utilitarian philosophers Peter Singer and Henry Sidgwick, 'there are moral assertions that we recognise intuitively as true... suffering is intrinsically bad, and... people's preferences should be satisfied.' To the topic, this means that mitigating the effects of climate change is necessary for providing the greatest happiness to the most people.  Contention 1: Developed countries are largely responsible for climate change  It is common truth that industrialized nations bear more responsibility for human-induced climate change. This is because over the years, dating back to the Industrial revolution, humans have been producing greenhouse gases that have influenced Earth's atmosphere. As such it would be unfair to ask developing countries to act similarly as developed countries. 'When the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was formulated ... the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities was acknowledged. ... [T]his principle recognized that 'The largest share of historical and current global emissions of greenhouse gases has originated in developed countries; 'Per capita emissions in developing countries are still relatively low; 'The share of global emissions originating in developing countries will grow to meet their social and development needs.'(The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) As a result, Today's developed nations are responsible for global warming and the effects of which we see today. And it is unfair to expect undeveloped world to make the same emissions reductions.  Contention 2: Developed countries are the only ones with the capabilities to act on climate change  No only do developed nation have the most to cut per capita, but they are also the only ones that have the technological advancements and resources to combat climate change. As such they have an obligation to use these resources to fix their planet. More importantly, the developed countries have the research capabilities to create the technology to make a green self-sustaining economy. For example, Italy for the first time has been able to utilize solar power to produce more electricity than wind power, thus accounting for nearly 3.2% of their total energy needs. In addition, by being at the forefront of this technology, Italy, a country constantly on the brink of economic disaster, has been able to become more stabilized and focus its energy on expanding its renewable energy market.(renewable energy world) Further, the developed world has the finance and expertise to develop these projects and implement and manage them all around the world. As the nations with the greatest capability, the developed world has the increased responsibility to act for the betterment of all.  Contention 3: The greatest impact will come when the largest emitters of greenhouse gases make reductions.  Developed countries emit the most greenhouse gases per capita, in 2008 the US emitted 17.9 tonnes compared to China's 5.3 tons per person. If reductions are made in such nations, then we will see a much bigger impact in the climate than if it came from developing nations. In addition, the developed countries with high CO2 emissions can reduce output through lifestyle changes. For example, biking to work instead of taking the car or cutting back on the junk food now and then. For developing nations, changes like that can not be made. They would have to change their entire economy and route to development to meat such needs even though they don't produce all that much in the first place. In the future, these developing nations will look to the actions of the developed world to plan for their future. By combating climate change, we ensure that everyone will eventually reach a point in which we can eliminate emissions all together.  Now onto my opponents case. His first part of his case talks about the term for developed countries being to broad, but yet offered a definition for it that narrows it down to the most developed. to counter this is will offer 5 of the most developed countries that I will be basing my arguments off of for this debate. 1. Norway 2. Australia 3. Netherlands 4. United States 5. New Zealand  Now onto my opponents first contention, his first contention only talks about the cost, yet cooling the ocean floor they average will only cost about 14 billion dollars and make 30 billion dollars back in agriculture growth. His second contention then talks about how climate change is uncontrollable, once again you can go back to the fact that cooling the ocean floor or simply reducing are CO2 intake will drastically decrease the weather. his 3rd contention talks about how the mitigation of climate change is not a moral obligation where he talks about how Norway is in debt almost $644.5 billion dollars, this is just giving us more of a reason to put this into place. Not only will we save money from this but we will also stop the temperatures from causing anymore mass destruction.  In Conclusion Global warming is an outcome of human activities rather than a natural disaster. Without maximum action from the developed world, all countries will be ultimately affected, including the rich countries. I would also like to mention that the temperatures in afghanistan reached almsot 145 degrees over this last summer, for are soldiers that type of weather is hard to bare. Their temperatures have been increasing over 11% every year now for the last 3 years, this amount of increase could lead to world destruction by the year 2018. the time is now to take action.</t>
<h>    For the purpose of this debate I propose the following definitions.</h>

  <pair id="863" entailment="NONENTAILMENT" task="IE">
    <t>My partner and I negate the resolution'Resolved: Developed countries have a moral obligation to mitigate the effects of climate change. A Developed Country is a sovereign state which has a highly developed economy and advanced technological infrastructure relative to other `less developed nations or one that is highly industrialized. The term ' Developed Countries' is too broad. There is a generalization that every developed country emits a significant amount of CO2 and can afford the taxation costs of mitigation. For example, India, even with advanced technology, is in a national debt of $ 345.8 billion. The World Bank classifies all low- and middle-income countries as developing. We feel it necessary to define the following terms: Moral Obligation- an obligation composed of morals of ethics and injustices. Climate change -the perpetual fluctuation in weather patterns in a particular region or worldwide. However, unlike global warming, which refers to just to the accession in the earth's surface temperature' climate change refers to alterations in a regions overall weather patterns, including precipitation, temperatures, cloud cover, Contention I : The cost of mitigating climate change in developed countries will negatively affect the economy. b In order to mitigate climate change as a government , the country must raise taxes. In Australia, Carbon is taxed at 23 per ton. According to the Australian government's modeling, this is likely to cause the cost of living to increase by an average of 0.7 per cent in the first year, and another 0.2 per cent in 2015-16. Every year the price will increase by 2.5% until 2015. Besides Governmental actions, most encouraged ways to control your carbon footprint are inconvenient and expensive. For example, carpooling, hybrid cars, and avoiding reforestation are inconvenient. Most Hybrid cars cost between $2,000 and $10,000 more than a gasoline engine car. To some people, they are not an option because of the higher prices. The average Hybrid has about 15-27 miles per gallon and most new gasoline powered cars get 22-29 mpg. Also, some people cannot lower the amount of gasoline they use. Not all occupants of a country are economically stable and therefore, our economy cannot afford the cost and taxes of mitigation. Contention 2: Certain aspects of climate change are uncontrollable and not caused by humankind. Solar emission and slow changes in the earth's orbital elements are natural causes of climate change. Solar emission is when magnetic energy in the sun has built up. These are not preventable therefore we don't have a moral obligation to mitigate it. Also, plate tectonics are not preventable by humans. It is a significant cause of climate change. Certain climate changes are not preventable. For example, during the ice age, the sea level rose 80 meters. Climate on Earth has changed significantly for over 2.4 billion years, even long before human activity could have played a role. According to the National Ocean Service, 'Starting with the ice ages that have come and gone in regular cycles for the past nearly three million years, there is strong evidence that these are linked to regular variations in the Earth's orbit around the Sun.' Contention III: The Mitigation of climate change is not a moral obligation. Moral Obligations should not exist. A country must stabilize itself before helping others. The fact is that most developed countries have a high national debt and must work on fixing themselves before fixing the world. For example, even the most developed country in the world, Norway is in a national debt of $644.5 billion. The definition of obligation is 'A bond of moral duty.' However, with the job of an obligation, our priorities are minimized especially economically. This is not a moral obligation. In fact, saying that developed countries are morally obligated to mitigate the effects of climate change is unethical. The countries should not be morally obligated to mitigate the effects of climate change; it should only be encouraged to people and therefore the responsibility of the people, not the government. Therefore Mitigating climate change in developed countries is expensive, not all developed countries are stable, and the mitigation of climate change is not a moral obligation. In conclusion, climate change should not be dealt with now because we do not have a moral obligation mitigate it</t>

    <t>To begin with, the definition of developed countries is incorrect. A developed country is a highly industrialized country. Your first contention states that developed countries are largely responsible for climate change. However, this is a broad generalization. Many of the countries that contribute to climate change are still developing because of their large debts. Also, there is a generalization that every country release a significant amount of of CO2. My opponent's case focuses on global warming rather that climate change. My opponent is ignoring that climate change is also caused by uncontrollable changes in our orbit around the sun and solar emissions. My opponent's second argument is that Developed countries are the only one's with capabilities to act on climate change. However, most Developed Countries do have a large national debt. We need to focus on the country's success before fixing the world. His last contention states that the greatest impact will come from when the largest emitters of greenhouse gasses make reductions. However, again this is a huge generalization. Not all developed countries release a signifigant amount of CO2 or even can afford to mitigate the effects of climate change. Your example of the US is irrevlevant. The United States cannot afford to cut back on the use of nonrenewable resources. You provide solutions that are inconvenient. For example, what if you live far from work, or couldn't afford organic foods. My opponent states that cooling the ocean floor only costs $14 billion. However most countries, with a massive debt cannot afford this. For example, take my previous argument that Norway is in a national debt of $644.5 billion. Shouldn't the country try to fix itself before fixing the world? The Norway example does not support the Pro argument. He states that it is more of a reason mitigate the effects of climate change. However, isn't it more of a reason to fix ourselves before the world. My opponent conceptualizes the view of how to mitigate the effects of climate change without providing a valid solution. Obviously $14 billion is not cheap and we should not invest in the world when our own country has economic issues that are not caused by Climate Change. Moreover, the action to mitigate climate change is more of a moral right to an individual rather than a country.</t>

    <t>Resolved: Developed countries have a moral obligation to mitigate the effects of climate change. Quote: 'One of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation.'-Thomas B. Reed Definitions: 'Developed countries: sovereign state which has a highly developed economy and advanced technological infrastructure relative to other less developed nations 'Moral obligation: an obligation arising out of considerations of right and wrong 'Mitigate: to lessen in force or intensity, as wrath, grief, harshness, or pain; moderate 'Effects: a change that is the result or consequence of an action or other cause 'Climate change: is a significant and lasting change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns over periods ranging from decades to millions of years. Contention 1: The economic impact of environmental legislation hurts the economies of developed countries. New regulations planned by the EPA could have detrimental effects to our economy ' particularly causing a loss of jobs, impeding economic recovery and harming livelihoods. The heart of the EPA's regulation would be a backdoor national energy tax that will ultimately kill jobs, stop economic growth and raise the cost of energy, food and transportation. They would also double the current regulatory standard on farm dust that would make tilling a field, operating a feedlot or diving farm vehicles impossible - bringing the agriculture sector to a standstill. A representative from the Virginia Farm Bureau Federation said, 'Farmers and their way of life and livelihood have never felt more challenged or threatened than they do today by the continuous onslaught of regulations and requirements from the Environmental Protection Agency... The cost they represent will impact the economy as a whole, and this committee should not be surprised when our economy contracts and jobs are lost to foreign competition.' An MIT study conducted by Stephen M. Meyers clearly shows that increased environmental regulation burdens the economy, especially in times of economic downfall. So why then, would we want any more ridiculous red tape? An increase in environmental regulation would result in the loss of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars, nobody wants to see that. Contention 2: The Earth's climate is always changing. If you talk to any credible climatologist, they will tell you the Earth's temperature has been much hotter and colder than it is now. Anyone saying that we should reverse the effects of climate change are obviously misinformed and have no scientific background. The climate is always in a state of constant change and development. The Earth goes through natural periods of cooling and warming, that's scientific fact. Would you blame the warming of the Earth after the last Ice Age on humans or man-made greenhouse gases? As with all the climate change nonsense, not a single claim can be substantiated as actual physical proof. Only assumptions and predictions made with manipulated computer models and deliberately corrupted data exist. Actual meteorological records and geophysical records destroy any credibility of everything ever said by these environmental groups. The real agenda of 'global warming' has nothing to do with climate or weather but all to do with politics and the financial gain of those who stand to benefit from green investments. What better an investment could they have than one where the government forces the use of a green scheme idea or product on the public? In a 1996 report by the UN on global warming, two statements were deleted from the final draft. Here they are: 1) 'None of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed climate changes to increases in greenhouse gases.' 2) 'No study to date has positively attributed all or part of the climate change to man'made causes. Contention 3: There is no moral obligation to mitigate climate change because nations are not moral entities. On what grounds are so-called 'developed countries' morally obligated to do anything? The simple fact is that there is no basis for this claim. Individuals, rather than government, determine morals. Government is not, and never has been where you should look for morals; you have that in your own heart and conscience; you teach that to your family. You cannot dictate what morals your neighbor has nor what morals your neighbor teaches his children. Make yourself an example with morals; that is all one can do. And certainly government has no place in that. The whole idea that a country would have a 'moral obligation' is unethical on the basis of Ethical Relativism, that ethics and morals are relative to each Nation or even culture and that there is no standard ethical or moral policy that all nation-states ought to abide by.</t>

The main point is that government attempts to curb the effects of global warming would have negative effects on the economy. Among his conjectures include the arguments that EPA regulations would cause 'a loss of jobs, impeding economic recovery and harming livelihoods' as well as 'result in the loss of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars'. Now besides the fact that Pro has neglected to source or substantiate his claims, his point would still fall moot if the effects of global climate change will be worse than the effects of environmental regulations. And scientific consensus supports this position, including the position of the European Academy of Science and Arts[1], the American Association for the Advancement of Science[2], the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change[3], among several other scientific organizations. Contention II: 'The Earth's climate is always changing.'This contention attempts to disprove the existence of man-made global climate change. There are a few problems with this point though. First, even if we were to concede that global climate change isn't man-made, that wouldn't change the existence of moral obligation on those able to do so if we take a utilitarian perspective i.e., global climate change could still pose a grave threat to humanity, thus provoking obligation to those who have the means to mitigate such effects. The second problem with this point is the fact that Pro has failed to provide any evidence to substantiate his claims. He claims that 'Anyone saying that we should reverse the effects of climate change are obviously misinformed and have no scientific background.' What an incredible claim, considering 'That humans are causing global warming is the position of the Academies of Science from 19 countries plus many scientific organizations that study climate science. More specifically, around 95% of active climate researchers actively publishing climate papers endorse the consensus position.'[4] The point is further corroborated by further studies, all available in Source 1.Contention III: 'There is no moral obligation to mitigate climate change because nations are not moral entities.'Pro's third and final contention rests on his conception of nations as non-moral entities. He makes two sub-points in regards to this contention: (a) he argues that a nation exists separately from the people that make them up and (b) with his assuming of ethical relativism in a societal context. I contend that neither of these points hold weight and that Pro is mistaken in his existential characterization of nations.(a) Pro's first mistake in his point is that he conceives nations as something distinct and separate from their individual parts i.e., their citizens. But try to conceive of a nation without citizens. It wouldn't exist. Nations only exist because a group of people come together to organize society. (b) Pro's second mistake lies in his application of ethical relativism. Even if we admit that morals are relative to individuals, Pro's point still fails in that he proves too much. For instance, if morals can only apply to people and not collective entities (assuming such things even exist), then we also can't apply moral criticism to any other collective entities, including corporations, interest groups, or even family households. The only way to overcome this obstacle is to dissolve the existence of collective entities or more than the sum of their parts. We can't apply moral duties to a nation, but we can apply those criticisms to the individual people who make them up.</t>

<h>I accept and I thank my opponent for setting up this debate. Let's get down to business.Resolution'The world is over populated'I will be arguing against this resolution. Therefore, to win all I must do is show that the world is not overpopulated.Burden of ProofPro will have the burden of proof as he is putting forth the positive claim.DefinitionsWorld: EarthOverpopulated: The population of an area in too large numbers -----Since Pro has made arguments in round one I assume that this round is for actual arguments and not just acceptance, so here we go.Counter Arguments1. Too many peoplePro claims that there are too many people, and this is just not the case. Every single person on Earth could fit into Texas and have a 66'x66' plot of land (enough for a single family home + yard) [1]. This would leave the entire rest of the inhabitable earth devoid of human life.2. Too few resourcesPro contends that there are too few resources, giving examples such as food and oil. In terms of food the problem isn't that there's too little food, it's that a select few groups of people are eating a disproportionate amount. Consider this; Americans, while only making up 5% of the worlds population, eat almost a quarter of all consumed food (24%). In fact, the average American consumes as much food as 370 Ethiopians. It's not just a matter of food consumed either. Americans throw out 200,000 tons (440,924,400 lbs) of edible food every day [2]. Consider also that less than half as many people die from famine each year now than a century ago, even though our population has quadrupled [4], and World agriculture produces 17 percent more calories per person today than it did 30 years ago, despite a 70 percent population increase [5].In terms of oil, we aren't even close to running out. The end of oil has been predicted for over 100 years now and year after year we see that our oil reserves are actually growing. In 1882 it was estimated that there was only 95 million barrels of oil remaining and that we would run out of oil before the end of the decade. By 1919 (37 years later) we still had oil and it was estimated that we would run out of oil in 20 years. By 1950 (31 years later), there was over 100 billion barrels of oil estimated on reserve. This cycle of people predicting the end of oil and oil reserves increasing has continued until today. Long story short, we now have estimated about 1.25 trillion barrels of oil remaining -- over 13,000x as much oil on reserve as was estimated in 1882 when the death of oil was first predicted [3]. I highly recommend checking out the rest of this video for those of you who want the rest of the figures given. 3. GarbageOnce again, this isn't an issue of numbers, but an issue of poor management. Consider this; 'Due to developments in waste management, the projected landfill waste for the United States (a relatively massive producer of waste) over the entire next century could be stored in a landfill area only 18 miles on each side.' [4].This landfill could even be reduced by upwards of 70% due to recycling [6]. So it's clear that trash is only as big of a problem as we let it be -- and even then how big of a problem it can be is exaggerated.Finally, it has not been established that humans are responsible for climate change. This needs to be established before I can be expected to debunk this claim. 4. Irrelevant ArgumentsThe rest of Pro's argument is about ways we can reduce our population and the projected benefits of a smaller population. There are numerous problems with what he's said, but there's no point in arguing about it because ultimately these things are irrelevant to both of our positions. All Pro needs to establish is that the world is overpopulated and all I need to do is refute his argument for that resolution. Questions of how to do deal with overpopulation are meaningless unless it is established that the world is overpopulated in the first place.ConclusionI've shown that in terms of land, oil and food, the world is not overpopulated nor is it even close to being as such. As it stands right now, Pro's BOP has not been fulfilled.I look forward to your response.</h>

    <t>Thanks for the debate Idaho_Rebel.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the leading international body for the assessment of climate change, has stated that climate change has major environmental, social, political, and economic consequences. The issue at stake in this debate, whether developed countries have a moral obligation to mitigate the consequences of climate change, is thus quite necessary.Pro Case1. What are the potential 'effects' of climate change? Atmospheric CO2 concentrations will reach 400ppm by 2017, if not earlier, making a rise in average global temperatures inevitable. It has been predicted that urban 'heat island' effects (the result of rising temperatures) will result in the death of tens of thousands of people across the world. Other predictions include: high-intensity storms and flooding, causing property and infrastructure damage; droughts threatening food and water supplies; wildfires, desertification, and soil erosion destroying agricultural land, raising food prices, and leading to large-scale migrations; and rising sea levels, devastating low-lying coastal settlements (including many major cities).Source: IPCC, 2011: IPCC Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation. Why do 'developed countries' have a moral obligation to mitigate these effects?The potential harms caused by climate change should be readily apparent, so it shouldn't come as a surprise that there is some sort of obligation to mitigate the effects of climate change, regardless of which ethical precept is applied. For example, a utilitarian ethics (greatest good for the greatest number) is just as likely to recommend policies that mitigate the effects of climate change as a Kantian ethics (regarding the rightness of actions themselves). So then, the next question is: 'who' carries the burden or moral obligation to curb the effects of climate change?The issue at stake here is one of responsibility: do particular governments have more responsibility than others?A reasonable principle to apply here would be the 'common but differentiated responsibility' principle: the idea that everyone bears a responsibility to mitigate the effects of climate change, but those with the ability to pay have a greater burden to do so. We could apply other ethical principles, such as the idea of 'intergenerational equity' (the debt to future generations) or 'compensatory equity' (the debt to more socioeconomically vulnerable people). The conclusion of these principles suggests developed countries, who by definition are more advanced economically and technologically, have a greater burden to mitigate the effects of climate change than do currently developing countries.Con CaseRe: 'Contention 1'My opponent's argument, that the 'economic impact of environmental legislation hurts the economies of developed countries,' is flawed for two reasons. First, my opponent completely neglects the possibility of alternative mitigation proposals, some which might even have a positive effect on the economy. For example, the development of drought-resistant crops, storm-resistant housing, climate-resilient infrastructure, and secure food/water supplies could easily produce new jobs and stimulate economic growth. Indeed, there is no need to focus on CO2 emissions when other options exist. In low-lying coastal settlements, for example, we could build sea walls, which are not only cheaper but much more likely to protect than an energy tax.Second, my opponent's argument offers no reason to believe environmental legislation would hurt the economy. How would the EPA's national energy tax 'kill jobs' and 'stop economic growth'? How would it make 'tilling a field' and 'operating a feedlot' impossible? The only answer my opponent provides to these questions is 'foreign competition.' This fear is unfounded, however, because the EPA's regulations only apply to global industries (domestic industries would be unaffected since they all operate under the same restrictions). Moreover, since fossil fuels are already becoming more expensive relative to renewable sources, an energy tax would simply accelerate a transition to 'green energy' that is already underway, including the retraining of carbon-intensive industries for 'green jobs.' The U.S. economy as a whole would remain competitive.Re: 'Contention 2'The argument that humans are not responsible for climate change is irrelevant: assuming climate change is harmful to the well-being of humans, it would not matter who or what was responsible for the harm. The issue at stake in this debate is who is responsible for cleaning up the mess, not who is responsible for creating the mess. To clarify this point, consider Peter Singer's example of a child drowning in a shallow pond: do we have a moral obligation to rescue the child? Yes, we do. Now, suppose someone pushed the child into the shallow pond; does this fact suddenly absolve you of the moral obligation to rescue the child? No, it doesn't.The burden of mitigating the effects of climate change falls on humanity as a whole, with a greater burden placed on those who can better afford to pay for mitigation proposals. The issue of who is responsible for climate change is thus irrelevant.Re: 'Contention 3'My opponent argues that 'nations are not moral entities,' so therefore the 'idea that a country would have a 'moral obligation' is unethical on the basis of Ethical Relativism.' The argument is not only entirely incoherent (how can something be objectively 'unethical' on the basis of 'Ethical Relativism'?), but its premises are flat-out wrong.The problem is that my opponent confuses descriptive ethics with normative ethics, taking the existence of different moral views (it is true that different individuals, cultures, and countries can have different moral doctrines) to establish the lack of a true morality that 'nation-states ought to abide by.' Just because a particular individual or nation believes their moral view is the right one does not make it right. A culture might practice slavery or cannibalism, but the fact they believe these practices ethical does not make itself make these practices ethical.If we employ an objective ethical framework, such as a utilitarian or deontological ethics which both make claims of universality and objectivity, then my opponent's argument is clearly misguided. But suppose we grant my opponent his claim of ethical relativism, that does not mean no ethical precept can be established. It simply means that, from our perspective, what is right is determined by what we believe. That does not mean what we believe is not a 'standard ethical or moral policy.' On the contrary, the whole point of ethical relativism is to establish that our morality is situated in our specific culture, and since our culture is one in which protecting the life and property of our citizens is of ethical importance, mitigating climate change is thus also important.The other point my opponent makes - that individuals, not nations, are moral entities - makes no sense. A country or government has the choice - rational free choice - to make decisions and affect the world, just like an individual. This simple fact makes a country a 'moral entity,' in the sense that my opponent uses the term. The distinction between individual and country does not hold up, because countries are simply the association of individuals for a specific purpose under a particular name. This allows countries to function in the same way as individuals, making them moral entities.</t>

    <t>'One of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation.'-Thomas B. Reed Definitions: 'Developed countries: sovereign state which has a highly developed economy and advanced technological infrastructure relative to other less developed nations 'Moral obligation: an obligation arising out of considerations of right and wrong 'Mitigate: to lessen in force or intensity, as wrath, grief, harshness, or pain; moderate 'Effects: a change that is the result or consequence of an action or other cause 'Climate change: is a significant and lasting change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns over periods ranging from decades to millions of years. Contention 1: The economic impact of environmental legislation hurts the economies of developed countries. New regulations planned by the EPA could have detrimental effects to our economy ' particularly causing a loss of jobs, impeding economic recovery and harming livelihoods. The heart of the EPA's regulation would be a backdoor national energy tax that will ultimately kill jobs, stop economic growth and raise the cost of energy, food and transportation. They would also double the current regulatory standard on farm dust that would make tilling a field, operating a feedlot or diving farm vehicles impossible - bringing the agriculture sector to a standstill. A representative from the Virginia Farm Bureau Federation said, 'Farmers and their way of life and livelihood have never felt more challenged or threatened than they do today by the continuous onslaught of regulations and requirements from the Environmental Protection Agency... The cost they represent will impact the economy as a whole, and this committee should not be surprised when our economy contracts and jobs are lost to foreign competition.' An MIT study conducted by Stephen M. Meyers clearly shows that increased environmental regulation burdens the economy, especially in times of economic downfall. So why then, would we want any more ridiculous red tape? An increase in environmental regulation would result in the loss of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars, nobody wants to see that. Contention 2: The Earth's climate is always changing. If you talk to any credible climatologist, they will tell you the Earth's temperature has been much hotter and colder than it is now. Anyone saying that we should reverse the effects of climate change are obviously misinformed and have no scientific background. The climate is always in a state of constant change and development. The Earth goes through natural periods of cooling and warming, that's scientific fact. Would you blame the warming of the Earth after the last Ice Age on humans or man-made greenhouse gases? As with all the climate change nonsense, not a single claim can be substantiated as actual physical proof. Only assumptions and predictions made with manipulated computer models and deliberately corrupted data exist. Actual meteorological records and geophysical records destroy any credibility of everything ever said by these environmental groups. The real agenda of 'global warming' has nothing to do with climate or weather but all to do with politics and the financial gain of those who stand to benefit from green investments. What better an investment could they have than one where the government forces the use of a green scheme idea or product on the public? In a 1996 report by the UN on global warming, two statements were deleted from the final draft. Here they are: 1) 'None of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed climate changes to increases in greenhouse gases.' 2) 'No study to date has positively attributed all or part of the climate change to man'made causes. Contention 3: There is no moral obligation to mitigate climate change because nations are not moral entities. On what grounds are so-called 'developed countries' morally obligated to do anything? The simple fact is that there is no basis for this claim. Individuals, rather than government, determine morals. Government is not, and never has been where you should look for morals; you have that in your own heart and conscience; you teach that to your family. You cannot dictate what morals your neighbor has nor what morals your neighbor teaches his children. Make yourself an example with morals; that is all one can do. And certainly government has no place in that. The whole idea that a country would have a 'moral obligation' is unethical on the basis of Ethical Relativism, that ethics and morals are relative to each Nation or even culture and that there is no standard ethical or moral policy that all nation-states ought to abide by.</t>

<h>Aff Resolved: Developed countries have a moral obligation to mitigate the effects of climate change.  For the purpose of this debate I propose the following definitions. Developed countries is a term used to identify the wealthiest nations in the world, which include Western Europe, the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. (ww Norton amp; co. economics textbook) Moral obligation is a duty arising out of considerations of right and wrong (Princeton University)  For our framework, we will be using utilitarianism, which is that actions should be directed toward promoting the greatest happiness of the greatest number of persons. Specifically, according to utilitarian philosphers Peter Singer and Henry Sidgwick, 'there are moral assertions that we recognise intuitively as true... suffering is intrinsically bad, and... people's preferences should be satisfied.' To the topic, this means that mitigting the effects of climate change is neccessary for providing the greatest happiness to the most people.  Contention 1: Developed countries are largely responsible for climate change  It is common truth that industrialized nations bear more responsibility for human-induced climate change. This is because over the years, dating back to the Industrial revolution, humans have been producing greenhouse gases that have influenced Earth's atmosphere. As such it would be unfair to ask developing countries to act similarly as developed countries. 'When the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was formulated ... the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities was acknowledged. ... [T]his principle recognized that •The largest share of historical and current global emissions of greenhouse gases has originated in developed countries; •Per capita emissions in developing countries are still relatively low; •The share of global emissions originating in developing countries will grow to meet their social and development needs.'(The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) As a result, Today's developed nations are responsible for global warming and the effects of which we see today. And it is unfair to expect undeveloped world to make the same emissions reductions.  Contention 2: Developed countries are the only ones with the capabilities to act on climate change  No only do developed nation have the most to cut per capita, but they are also the only ones that have the technological advancements and resources to combat climate change. As such they have an obligation to use these resources to fix their planet. More importantly, the developed countries have the research capabilities to create the technology to make a green self-sustaining economy. For example, Italy for the first time has been able to utilize solar power to produce more electricity than wind power, thus accounting for nearly 3.2% of their total energy needs. In addition, by being at the forefront of this technology, Italy, a country constantly on the brink of economic disaster, has been able to become more stabilized and focus its energy on expanding its renewable energy market.(renewable energy world) Further, the developed world has the finance and expertise to develop these projects and implement and manage them all around the world. As the nations with the greatest capability, the developed world has the increased responsibility to act for the betterment of all.  Contention 3: The greatest impact will come when the largest emitters of greenhouse gases make reductions.  Developed countries emit the most greenhouse gases per capita, in 2008 the US emitted 17.9 tonnes compared to China's 5.3 tons per person. If reductions are made in such nations, then we will see a much bigger impact in the climate than if it came from developing nations. In addition, the developed countries with high CO2 emissions can reduce output through lifestyle changes. For example, biking to work instead of taking the car or cutting back on the junk food now and then. For developing nations, changes like that can not be made. They would have to change their entire economy and route to development to meat such needs even though they don't produce all that much in the first place. In the future, these developing nations will look to the actions of the developed world to plan for their future. By combating climate change, we ensure that everyone will eventually reach a point in which we can eliminate emissions all together.  In Conclusion Global warming is an outcome of human activities rather than a natural disaster. Without maximum action from the developed world, all countries will be ultimately affected, including the rich countries.</h>

    <t>There are over 7 billion people on the earth. This currently large population is due to proper nutrition and modern medicine. Such a large population requires a large amount of resource that are often limited like coal, oil, land, and sometime food. Humans are also very destructive to the environment by using resources fast than the earth can replenish them. Human presence in an area can also mean the extinction of animals and plant species that can be vital to a balanced and health ecosystem. Developed countries produce so much waste that the environment will be inhabitable to animals or humans. Humans may even be responsible for a climate change. Encourage an intentional population decrease would tramendously help relieve the strain and damage that over population can cause. It can also help economical situations by having more need for workers and consumers. The way we would decrease the population would be to encourage people to have only one kid or no children. Allow the elderly to pass on when they have reached there time. Make suicide legal and to allow those unable to survive with out machines to pass on. These decision would be voluntary and would be a collected effort to keep the environment we live in habitable and to keep the human race from expanding past what the environment can handle.

    <t>Resolved: Developed countries have a moral obligation to mitigate the effects of climate change.  My partner and I stand in firm negation of the resolution. We feel it necessary to define the following terms: Developed Country- is a sovereign state which has a highly developed economy and advanced technological infrastructure relative to other less developed nations. Moral Obligation- an obligation arising out of considerations of right and wrong. Morals are assessed based on the cost and benefits of a situation. Climate Change- Climate change, is a change in the typical or average weather of a region or city. Climate change is also a change in Earth's overall climate. This could be a change in Earth's average temperature. -NASA  Contention 1: Humans have little effect on climate change and yet take on much of the blame for the situation.  Subpoint A:Contrary to popular belief, humans have very little effect on Earth's changing climate. Most changes to climate are a result of geological or natural events, which we have ZERO control over. These include Solar output, Volcanism, Earth's orbital changes, and Plate tectonics. These might seem like they make minor differences, but these are responsible for short and long term climate fluctuations, including ice ages; and it can be agreed on that a massive cooling of the Earth for ten thousand years is a major change in climate. The earth has been going through cycles of cooling and warming for the last ten thousand years, and we have evidence which shows we are actually in a global cooling, which is part of Earth's natural patterns. Why would us humans have any sort of obligation to mitigate the effects of climate change. Climate change is a natural process which we have no control over. Trying to change a natural cycle that has been going on for million of years is completely impossible, and we have no moral obligation to do something impossible.  Subpoint B:Humans are incorrectly accused of the recent warming of the climate. However, this cycle of heating has been happening since humans weren't even fully evolved. A quote from an article of Climate Physics states 'About 450 million years ago the temperature dropped significantly even though the CO2 concentration was about 12 times higher than today. This disproves the hypothesis that CO2 causes global warming.' This is also backed up scientifically. A graph titled 'As carbon dioxide increases it has less warming effect' shows and explains how we can DOUBLE the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere with an almost unnoticeable increase in temperature. Increasing carbon dioxide levels also does not affect the atmosphere. This is because as the concentration of Co2 increases, so does the rate of photosynthesis, resulting in equal amounts of oxygen and carbon dioxide.  Contention 2: Climate change won't have a major impact on human lives  Climate change as a result of human activities doesn't have a major impact on human lives.  Conclusion: Why we aren't obliged Because humans are such a minor influence in climate change, we have no obligation to mitigate climate change. Why would we spend money to change the weather, and a lot of money at that. A book on globalizing renewable energy by 2030 states the cost to do so 'might be on the order of $100 trillion worldwide, over 20 years, not including transmission.' Alternate forms of energy also have major drawbacks, besides being very cost heavy, and these drawbacks do developed countries more harm than good. we have no control over climate change, and even if we did there is no need to worry, as the climate is just following natural patterns.</t>
<h>    Resolved: Developed countries have a moral obligation to mitigate the effects of climate change.</h>

    <t>I extend all of my points and I would point out that my opponent can still post a case to be reviewed in the next round. Likewise, I would like some feedback on my case.</t>
<h>I would like to thank Numidious for accepting this debate. I. The Universe and Global WarmingThe current state of the Galaxy and our Sun is affecting our temperatures.I.i. The Rest of the Solar SystemThe Sun clearly is in a warmer phase, because all of the other planets have increasing temperatures as well. 'In 2005 data from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor and Odyssey missions revealed that the carbon dioxide 'ice caps' near Mars's south pole had been diminishing for three summers in a row.Habibullo Abdussamatov, head of space research at St. Petersburg's Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory in Russia, says the Mars data is evidence that the current global warming on Earth is being caused by changes in the sun.'[1]''Global warming on Neptune's moon Triton as well as Jupiter and Pluto, and now Mars has some [scientists] scratching their heads over what could possibly be in common with the warming of all these planets … Could there be something in common with all the planets in our solar system that might cause them all to warm at the same time?''[2] Two things can be drawn from this. One, that if other planets are warming, that it is only natural for the Earth to be warming as well. And second, that even if all these planets did have natural causes, then that is a sign of Earth's natural climatic change, instead of man-made. I.ii. The Position of the Milky Way GalaxyEvery approximately 135 million years, Earth enters a more populated area of the Milky Way, and as a result, more cosmic rays hit the Earth, which causes cooling. Currently, we are in a less populated area of the Milky Way, which means that less of these cosmic rays will be hitting the Earth, which means less cloud formation, and of course, warming. [3] for the source on this hypothesis. The sun can also cause this through evaporation.II. Earthly CausesThere are many internal causes of Global Warming as well. II.i. Ocean Current Anomalies Ocean temperature anomalies seem to be rising-along with the temperature. '...one can model past temperatures as a linear trend (that started well before CO2 was added in any substantial quantity) and periodic bumps... ...temperatures over the last 100+ years look a lot like a linear trend plus ocean cycle-driven bumps'[4] What is causing all the bumps?:  [4]  As shown in the graph, the PDO, or ocean currents, temperature has affected the average Earth's temperature.    II.ii. Clouds: A Continuation of Point I.ii.I mentioned about the position of the Milky Way Galaxy and the Sun in regards to these 'cosmic rays'. Here is a more in depth look at the effects of position. 'The implications, if true, had potentially enormous implications for the debate about natural causes of warming. When the sun is very active, it can be thought of as pushing away cosmic rays from the Earth, reducing their incidence. When the sun is less active, we see more cosmic rays. This is fairly well understood. But if Svensmark was correct, it would mean that periods of high solar output should coincide with reduced cloud formation (due to reduced cosmic race incidence), which in turn would have awarming effect on the Earth, since less sunlight would be reflected back into space before hitting the Earth.Here was a theory, then, that would increase the theoretical impact on climate of an active sun, and better explain why solar irradiance changes might be underestimating the effect of solar output changes on climate and temperatures.'[4]'Since he first suggested his hypothesis over a decade and a half ago, Svensmark and other researchers have slowly been putting together research to test it.' The results were: 'Scientists found that when shielding was removed and natural cosmic rays allowed to hit the chamber, cloud seeding increased dramatically, and it increased substantially again when additional artificial cosmic rays were added. Svensmark appears to have gotten it right.'[5] Proof here is in the next points. III. The 1500-Year Cycle This has to do with a cycle of the climate that can explain the warming. 'Through at least the last million years, a moderate 1500-year warm-cold cycle has been superimposed over the longer, stronger Ice Ages and warm interglacials.'[6]  Here is a graph related to this: [7]There are two things we can conclude from this graph. First, that up-and-down cycles are normal for the long-term climate. This century's global warming is nothing new. The second thing we can conclude, is that today's global warming is not as bad as the Medieval Warm Period's peak yet, and the Medieval Warm Period was less than the Holocene Maximum Period.    'Even more important, the earth is not 'the warmest it has ever been.' In fact, the earth was much warmer during the Medieval Warm Period when human agriculture flourished!'[7]'The scientists found evidence that on average, every 1,470 years, plus or minus 500 years, cold, ice-bearing waters, which today circulate around southern Greenland, pushed as far south as Great Britain.'[8] There seems to be a full cycle of up-down-up temperatures of the climate every 1470 years. And this goes as far back as at least 1 million years ago. Currently, we are in an upswing of temperatures, just coming off of the Little Ice Age, the peak to be in a few hundred years, making the peak-to-peak difference between today's global warming and the Medieval Warm Period a little less than 1500 years. So today's Global Warming is a natural, cyclical occurence.    IV. The Sun: The Proof of Theories I.ii and II.iiThe sun's cycles have a lot to do with temperatures also.  'In this chamber, 63 CERN scientists from 17 European and American institutes have done what global warming doomsayers said could never be done — demonstrate that cosmic rays promote the formation of molecules that in Earth’s atmosphere can grow and seed clouds, the cloudier and thus cooler it will be. Because the sun’s magnetic field controls how many cosmic rays reach Earth’s atmosphere (the stronger the sun’s magnetic field, the more it shields Earth from incoming cosmic rays from space), the sun determines the temperature on Earth.'[9]'Svensmark matched the data on cosmic rays from the neutron monitor in Climax, Colorado, with the satellite measurements of solar irradiance from 1970 to 1990. Over the period between 1975 and 1989, he found cosmic rays decreased by 1.2 percent annually, amplifying the sun's change in irradiance about four-fold'[6]So, as the sun's activity increases, so does the temperature. This below graph shows the correlation: [10] This graph clearly shows that temperature goes up and down with solar activity, because an increase in solar activity directly correlates with an increase in average temperature 1-2 years later. And as a final side note, I would like to present this graph that helps disprove the anthropogenic cause theory, regarding again, ocean temperature anomalies: [4]So 'nature' created the same temperature trend as 'humans' did. </h>

    <t>The first round is acceptance I as the Con side await a worthy aff challenger and wish good luck to both sides.</t>
<h>Hello again, I appreciate my opponent's commitment also. The debate has been interesting, if long. Unfortunately my last response was somewhat incoherent towards the end - this is because it was written at a time when I should have been asleep...I. Find the Gases that Causes the Planet to Warm I am glad that my opponent does not refute this. However, what my opponent must mean by agreeing with it is that the greenhouse effect actually exists, as I explained. If the greenhouse effect exists, then enhancement of that effect must warm the planet! My opponent states later that 'carbon dioxide does not correlate with temperature very well,' but it must if he agree with these statements.II. Ensure that those Gases Enter and Remain in the Atmosphere in Greater (or Lesser) Quantities than Beforei. Methane I agree that, relative to the natural amount of methane entering the atmosphere, the human contribution is fairly small (20%). What my opponent does not realize is that this small change can have MASSIVE effects - the CO2 and Methane (and water vapour) that are in and are cycling through our atmosphere now have been keeping the planet warm for ages, and thank goodness for that as otherwise the average temperature on earth would have been at -18 degrees celsius, that's zero degrees fahrenheit for you Americans, otherwise known as enough for the surface of the planet to be solid ice!Now we know the effects of the amount we already have (from -18 to 14, or 0 to 57 in fahrenheit) just imagine what a slight, minor increase will do... Keeping in mind that the difference between now and the last ice age is just 5 degrees celsius, that's 10 fahrenheit.Methane warms the world '20 times faster than CO2' (1) and although it is only at 1/200th of the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere (and the increase is proportional to this) that still makes methane emissions responsible for 28% of current warming.My opponent's graph is correct, saying that in 2004 methane emissions were going down. Does that preclude the idea that methane caused warming in the years before 2004, or will again? The argument is fallacious in and of itself. Also, AFTER 2004 methane emissions began to increase again, shown here. This may be because methane was trapped in arctic ice, melted by global warming. A fact, by the way, that my opponent cannot dispute - to say that global warming is not happening wrecks his own arguments, to say that there is no natural gas/methane in arctic sea ice is to contradict accepted science.II.ii. CFCsOnce more my opponent asserts that because something will not happen in the future means that it is not happening in the present or did not happen in the past. CFCs, which are entirely human synthesized, are no longer in use. This is, as I mentioned earlier, a success. Since CFCs never had the chance to warm the planet too much (though they certainly damaged the ozone layer) I added them as an afterthought on how humans are capable of changing our planet.II.iii. Nitrous OxideMy opponent's reply here is similar to his on methane, and I give a similar response - small changes in the environment can have massive effects, and my evidence is the same as well - the temperature the planet would be at without the greenhouse effect. Nitrous oxide is particularly interesting in this case because it traps heat 300x as fast as carbon dioxide. This is a phenomenal amount, but since much less nitrous oxide ends up in the atmosphere every year than carbon dioxide, it remains a lesser contributor to warming.  My opponent asserts that cows reduce nitrous oxide in the atmosphere - but by how much? The reference my opponent provided was inconclusive at best.  iv. Carbon Dioxide  My opponent's assertion here that the troposphere is not warming is, unfortunately, incorrect, as this graph should exemplify.According to Science Daily, 'The troposphere, the lower part of the atmosphere closest to the Earth, is warming and this warming is broadly consistent with both theoretical expectations and climate models, according to a new scientific study that reviews the history of understanding of temperature changes and their causes in this key atmospheric layer.'My opponent claims that his graph 'disproves the greenhouse theory' but does not recognize that the natural greenhouse effect has been warming the planet for thousands of years - he is welcome to suggest that CO2 could come from another source than humans, but to say that the greenhouse effect does not exist contradicts this (5) this (6) and this (7) and many, many other sources. In fact, the greenhouse effect itself was known to be true long before global warming, in 1824 when Joseph Fourier first expained it. You have to wonder, where else would all the CO2 go? It doesn't just disappear!My opponent is self contradictory here, as in the same argument he concurs that carbon dioxide and other gases warm the atmosphere but denies that the greenhouse effect they create exists, and furthermore denies that adding any MORE carbon dioxide would warm the atmosphere to a greater extent!If one is to study my opponent's graph here more closely, one realizes that the ppm of carbon dioxide is increasing on this graph, and quite alarmingly. In a mere 30 years it increased by 30 ppm in our entire atmosphere! This is very alarming, especially considering what I mentioned earlier, the fact that the natural amount of ppm of carbon in our atmosphere has warmed the earth 60 degrees fahrenheit and 30 celsius! I repeat again as well that the difference between now and the last ice age was 6 degrees. Thus the temperature and the ppm shown here ARE correlated, and in a very alarming way.The next graph presented is in fact a clever trick - it focus only on minor temperature changes and not on the larger picture it merely sets the information so that the lines fit. It is true, as I have mentioned that the sun causes short term variations in temperature. However, here is a graph that shows OVERALL temperatures, and thus the long term correlation between CO2 and temperature. The next piece here (A 'cooling' arctic) is simply incorrect. I can show you better than explain, but here are a few quotes anyhow.'Since 1951 the arctic has warmed twice as much as the global average' (9)'The temperature in the arctic has gone up 1.5 degrees celsius, whereas the world has gone up 0.7 degrees.''Arctic's rapid temperature rise breaks records.' (10)'Last year NASA released reports showing arctic temperatures going beyond 2010 records.' (11)For my opponent's final point, he says that global warming causes rises in CO2 levels. How? The greenhouse effect has been established, and accepted by my opponent. If CO2 levels are a a lagging indicator, then how are 1960 - 1990 on these graphs explained?II.iv. Water VapourWhat my opponent does not realize here is that temperature rises cause water vapour to increase! Therefore a 1 degree celsius rise in temperature from CO2 causes a 3 degree rise from water vapour - thermal expansion means more water evaporates.No more space - one last graph.This explains the speed of current warming best.</h>

    <t>Well, if Fox News said it, then it must be true.</t>
<h>I am here going to prove to the audience and to my opposition that global warming is primarily caused by homo sapiens and is thus a characteristic of the anthropocene - a term recently created by geologists to express 'the age of man.' I have yet to thorougly read my opponent's arguments, so anything that I write that may seem to be a rebuttal is pure coincidence. I thank my opponent for challenging me to this debate and hope for an interesting exchange of ideas. Either he'll learn something or I will!Three Steps to Damaging the Planet (Human Style)A) Find the gases that cause the planet to warmThe following gases contribute to the greenhouse effect...(10)Feedback GasesWATER VAPOURWater vapour is a 'feedback' to the climate rather than a cause of climate change. It is a greenhouse gas, but it does not contribute to a change in the greenhouse effect, rather, it changes with the temperature of the atmosphere, and thus acts as a way of telling if we're doing things right. Put simply, we on earth can't directly affect the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere, but more of it should tell us that the temperature of the planet is warming (because it evaporates. We can't heat the oceans by ourselves so we need something less direct.) and thus there's a cause - effect relationship - more CO2/Methane/etc. = Higher Temperaures = More Water VapourCausal GasesMETHANENot what you were expecting, right? But still very important. Most mammals have natural methane emissions of a kind, and this can change, so this will go into our recipe for messing with our climate. Naturally, however, it is emitted at 270 teragrams per year (9) Come back to this later.NITROUS OXIDEAlso causal to rather than resulting from a change in climate, that is, we can change how much goes into the atmosphere.CFCsThe same ones that destroy the ozone layer, this time, they're back to destroy the biosphere. I say 'destroy' because CFCs are as irrefutably man - made as CO2 and Methane are not, and therefore MUST be at least one reason that the atmosphere is warming. (Since they are artificial, to say that an increase in their quantity has non - anthropogenic causes would be like saying that trees can be made of plastic).CARBON DIOXIDEThe classic greenhouse gas. Carbon dioxide is absorbed to some extent in grass and trees (photosynthesis) on a natural level, and otherwise may be released through volcanoe and major forest fires, or the combustion of organic material. This usually accounts for 750 gigatons (8) of CO2 moving through the carbon cycle every year, not including human intervention.The gases listed here under causal warm the earth through the greenhouse effect. This is not controversial, here's how it works(7)The greenhouse effect, WITHOUT human intervention (except obviously in CFCs), is caused by the above gases in the above way. Now all we have to do is add a greedy, unenlightened species and we're on our way...B) Ensure that those gases enter and remain in the atmosphere in greater (or lesser) quantities than beforeMETHANEHumans add 330 teragrams per year (9) of methane to the atmosphere every year to the 270 teragrams already entering it, mostly through methane emitted by livestock (a single modern cow emits 270 kg of methane each year), from decay in landfills and from waste treatment, not to mention the burning of biomass. If the 330 teragrams going into the atmosphere WITHOUT humans every year causes 9% of the greenhouse effect, as noted above, then that amount doubling will, of course, ENHANCE the greenhouse effect, causing - global warming. The truth is that it would be strange if it DIDN'T. There are now 2 billion cows on the planet, far more than at any point in history. They, through methane emissions, are enhancing the greenhouse effect.CARBON DIOXIDEIt has been mentioned that 750 gigatons goes through the carbon cycle every year. Humans add 29 gigatons (8) - haha, the opposition says, the amount of human emissions of CO2 every year pale in compare to how much goes through the carbon cycle! But then one takes closer look - every year, 439 gigatons are released and 450 are absorbed by plants and trees. Suddenly, the 29 gigatons becomes much more frightening, especially when one observes that carbon dioxide is now at 390 ppm (parts per million) in the atmosphere, nearly twice as high as it has been for the last 500,000 years! The higher amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is also caused, of course, by the fact that our conversion of land for agriculture has led to land with plants that absorb less CO2 (virtually all my references will say this) so that the number of gigatons absorbed (450) is decreasing whilst the 29 is increasing, resulting in idle CO2 sitting around, warming up the atmosphere - as it must as a greenhouse gas.CO2 is poisonous as well, by the way, so even if my worthy opponent and/or audience leaves this debate with their minds unchanged on the topic of anthropogenic global warming, remember that there is still reason for CO2 emissions to be curtailed!CFCsThis is an optimistic part of the human - greenhouse effect story in that we actually stopped putting CFCs into the atmosphere when we realized how awful they were for the ozone layer. Therefore we do not put CFCs into the atmosphere any more - it's like a defunct greenhouse gas, in retirement.NITROUS OXIDENO2 has an atmospheric lifetime of 121 years (11) so naturally even a small amount of nitrous coming out of your exhaust enhances global warming for years to come. And when it's 110 to 240 thousand tonnes coming from car exhaust pipes every year, you know you have a problem. Add 2 to 4 million tonnes from fertilization practices in agriculture and you have a MAJOR problem! Add to this the fact that NO2 is 310 times as powerful as CO2 as a greenhouse gas and you have a full blown nightmare.Given the endless facts and evidence presented above, it would be strange if the atmosphere was NOT warming up from human intervention. The below only affirms what should be evident. On to our third and final step.C) Watch as the planet warms or cools six degrees, the difference between now and the last ice ageIt is often mentioned that the earth's climate has change in the past, and that is most assuredly true. It is also true, of course, that the earth's climate can change in the future, and for different reasons. However, what is unique about the warming of the anthropocene is that it has happened and is happening so suddenly, more suddenly than in the past. The closest example of climate change at this speed (just 120 years since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution), obviously excluding the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs, is the Palaeo - Eocene Thermal Maximum (13) about 55 million years ago, when the climate changed 5 to 8 degrees,that warming, of course, took several thousand years.</h>

    <t>I would like to thank my opponent for engaging with me in this great debate. I appreciate your commitment. I. The Current State of the Galaxy AND the Sun? That Is Very Unusual, Since they Do Not Necessarily Correlate  I.i. The Rest of the Solar System  '...it was noted the planet [Mars] was experiencing rapid warming, similar to what the Earth is currently undergoing.... The Martian icecaps are melting at a perilous pace.... ...and that both [warmings on Earth and Mars] can be explained by changes in solar irradiance.'[1]'Global warming was detected on Jupiter last year, and the warming is apparently behind the formation of a second red spot. Global warming on Neptune's moon Triton has also been noted, with severe atmospheric changes as a result. And even tiny Pluto has experienced moderate warming in recent years, with temperatures rising a full 3.5 degrees.  The common denominator in all these cases, the Earth included, is of course the Sun, which is in the middle of an extremely active period at present.'[1]So yes, all of these bodies are indeed warming, and it can all be attributed to increases in solar irradiance.I.ii. The Position of the Milky Way Galaxy ad Cosmic Rays'With the new results just published in the recognised journal Geophysical Research Letters, scientists have succeeded for the first time in directly observing that the electrically charged particles coming from space and hitting the atmosphere at high speed contribute to creating the aerosols that are the prerequisites for cloud formation.'[2] So yes, there is direct proof. Here is a picture explaining how cosmic rays create cloud formation:     [2]  And here is the proof for all of this:   [3]And finally, I know how much my opponent likes long-period graphs, so I thought I would go back 500 million years:     [4] So as shown, cosmic rays create clouds, so fewer cosmic rays create fewer clouds. And, fewer cosmic rays mean more sunspots, which means increased solar activity, which means warming (I will get to this hypothesis later). And, fewer clouds means higher temperatures. And, even if cosmic rays and temperature were diverging, you are ignoring the laws of thermodynamics (I will also get to this later).   II. Earthly Causes II.i. Ocean Current AnomaliesThe graph my opponent presented, when looked at closer, is actually self-defeating. You can see that when the PDO index is negative, temperatures decline, when the PDO index is nil, temperatures remain at the same level, and when the PDO index is positive, temperatures rise. Everyone can see the correlation:  [Your Graph+My Paint Work] Why are they diverging? Because there has been more positive PDO this year than negative, meaning that there will be more warming. This cannot be attributed to man because there is no correlation between CO2 levels and the PDO. 'A warm Pacific (positive PDO Index) as we found from 1922 to 1947 and again 1977 to 1997 has been found to be accompanied by more El Ninos, while a cool Pacific more La Ninas. Since El Ninos have been shown to lead to global warming and La Ninas global cooling, this should have an affect on annual mean temperature trends in North America.'[5]Again, the correlation can be better shown in these graphs:The correlation is very strong here, and, ocean currents rise and fall just before temperatures directly, meaning that ocean currents cause direct temperature changes, not the other way around:       [5] And again, here. As a side note, the upward linear trend started way before CO2 was added in any substantial quantity (i.e. temperature growth is not accelerating). It correlates perfectly:    [6]And finally, I advance this graph again because it shows perfectly my argument. Notice how temperatures start to rise 2-3 years after a PDO cycle change, again indicating that ocean currents cause direct temperature changes:  [6] II.ii. Clouds: A Continuation of Point I.ii.  This is from an experiment at CERN called CLOUD: 'Scientists found that when shielding was removed and natural cosmic rays allowed to hit the chamber, cloud seeding increased dramatically, and it increased substantially again when additional artificial cosmic rays were added.'[7]'They [Researchers] put realistic mixtures of the Earth's atmospheric gases into a large-reaction chamber, with ultraviolet light as a stand-in for the sun. When they turned on the UV, microscopic droplets of sulphuric acid-cloud seeds-started floating through the chamber.'[8]'Carslaw et al. point out that cosmic ray intensity declined by about 15 percent during the last century 'owing to an increase in the solar open magnetic flux by more than a factor of 2.' They further report that 'this 100-year change in intensity is about the same magnitude as the observed change over the last solar cycle.''[9]So yes, there is direct proof of the inverse relationship between cosmic rays and cloud formation. I already proved this correlation in point I.ii., so I will not repeat it here. III. The 1500-Year CycleI will show this graph again, and go even further back than my opponent:    [9]So indeed, the Medieval Warm Period and the Holocene Climate Maximum were higher than today. And, there is ample evidence that the Medieval Warm Period and Holocene Climate Maximum were hotter than today:'Chinese temperatures were 2 to 3 degrees C higher than present during China's climate optimum based on pollen data and the souther limits of permafrost.''The Mediterranean region, including the coast of North Africa, got more rainfall during the Medieval Warming period than it does in our time.''...during the Medieval Warming... . Temperatures may have been as much as 2.5 degrees C warmer [than today] due to a southward shift of the climate belts.'[8]The Medieval Warm Period and the Holocene Climate Maximum were clearly higher in all areas. Here are some graphs showing this:China:    [8]South Africa: [8]As shown, again, the Medieval Warm Period was a lot higher in temperature than today, which was eclipsed [MWP] by the Holocene Climate Maximum.    [10]So, today's warming is clearly not unprecedented. 'These are the Medieval Warm Period, which is  well known, but also a period during the toga-wearing Roman times when  temperatures were apparently 1 deg C warmer than now.'[11] This is backed up by tree ring research.'Indirect evidence suggests that the average temperature was as much as 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than today.'[12]So why this unprecedented warming in your graphs? Because it is scaled badly. It has only gone up 1 degree Celsius. Explain all of the evidence I have. IV. The Sun This is wrong for one reason: thermodynamics. The sun's activity level is so high that even when it stabilizes, there is still going to be an increase in temperatures. Notice temoerature increases are leveling off as the sun's activity decreases.  Still, even if that wasn't true, there is a lag between the lines. The lag is that the sun is 15 years ahead of the temperature. The temperature decrease is just starting.</t>

'In 2005 data from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor and Odyssey missions revealed that the carbon dioxide 'ice caps' near Mars's south pole had been diminishing for three summers in a row.Habibullo Abdussamatov, head of space research at St. Petersburg's Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory in Russia, says the Mars data is evidence that the current global warming on Earth is being caused by changes in the sun.'[1]''Global warming on Neptune's moon Triton as well as Jupiter and Pluto, and now Mars has some [scientists] scratching their heads over what could possibly be in common with the warming of all these planets … Could there be something in common with all the planets in our solar system that might cause them all to warm at the same time?''[2] Two things can be drawn from this. One, that if other planets are warming, that it is only natural for the Earth to be warming as well. And second, that even if all these planets did have natural causes, then that is a sign of Earth's natural climatic change, instead of man-made. I.ii. The Position of the Milky Way GalaxyEvery approximately 135 million years, Earth enters a more populated area of the Milky Way, and as a result, more cosmic rays hit the Earth, which causes cooling. Currently, we are in a less populated area of the Milky Way, which means that less of these cosmic rays will be hitting the Earth, which means less cloud formation, and of course, warming. [3] for the source on this hypothesis. The sun can also cause this through evaporation.II. Earthly CausesThere are many internal causes of Global Warming as well. II.i. Ocean Current Anomalies Ocean temperature anomalies seem to be rising-along with the temperature. '...one can model past temperatures as a linear trend (that started well before CO2 was added in any substantial quantity) and periodic bumps... ...temperatures over the last 100+ years look a lot like a linear trend plus ocean cycle-driven bumps'[4] What is causing all the bumps?:  [4]  As shown in the graph, the PDO, or ocean currents, temperature has affected the average Earth's temperature.    II.ii. Clouds: A Continuation of Point I.ii.I mentioned about the position of the Milky Way Galaxy and the Sun in regards to these 'cosmic rays'. Here is a more in depth look at the effects of position. 'The implications, if true, had potentially enormous implications for the debate about natural causes of warming. When the sun is very active, it can be thought of as pushing away cosmic rays from the Earth, reducing their incidence. When the sun is less active, we see more cosmic rays. This is fairly well understood. But if Svensmark was correct, it would mean that periods of high solar output should coincide with reduced cloud formation (due to reduced cosmic race incidence), which in turn would have awarming effect on the Earth, since less sunlight would be reflected back into space before hitting the Earth.Here was a theory, then, that would increase the theoretical impact on climate of an active sun, and better explain why solar irradiance changes might be underestimating the effect of solar output changes on climate and temperatures.'[4]'Since he first suggested his hypothesis over a decade and a half ago, Svensmark and other researchers have slowly been putting together research to test it.' The results were: 'Scientists found that when shielding was removed and natural cosmic rays allowed to hit the chamber, cloud seeding increased dramatically, and it increased substantially again when additional artificial cosmic rays were added. Svensmark appears to have gotten it right.'[5] Proof here is in the next points. III. The 1500-Year Cycle This has to do with a cycle of the climate that can explain the warming. 'Through at least the last million years, a moderate 1500-year warm-cold cycle has been superimposed over the longer, stronger Ice Ages and warm interglacials.'[6]  Here is a graph related to this: [7]There are two things we can conclude from this graph. First, that up-and-down cycles are normal for the long-term climate. This century's global warming is nothing new. The second thing we can conclude, is that today's global warming is not as bad as the Medieval Warm Period's peak yet, and the Medieval Warm Period was less than the Holocene Maximum Period.    'Even more important, the earth is not 'the warmest it has ever been.' In fact, the earth was much warmer during the Medieval Warm Period when human agriculture flourished!'[7]'The scientists found evidence that on average, every 1,470 years, plus or minus 500 years, cold, ice-bearing waters, which today circulate around southern Greenland, pushed as far south as Great Britain.'[8] There seems to be a full cycle of up-down-up temperatures of the climate every 1470 years. And this goes as far back as at least 1 million years ago. Currently, we are in an upswing of temperatures, just coming off of the Little Ice Age, the peak to be in a few hundred years, making the peak-to-peak difference between today's global warming and the Medieval Warm Period a little less than 1500 years. So today's Global Warming is a natural, cyclical occurence.    IV. The Sun: The Proof of Theories I.ii and II.iiThe sun's cycles have a lot to do with temperatures also.  'In this chamber, 63 CERN scientists from 17 European and American institutes have done what global warming doomsayers said could never be done — demonstrate that cosmic rays promote the formation of molecules that in Earth’s atmosphere can grow and seed clouds, the cloudier and thus cooler it will be. Because the sun’s magnetic field controls how many cosmic rays reach Earth’s atmosphere (the stronger the sun’s magnetic field, the more it shields Earth from incoming cosmic rays from space), the sun determines the temperature on Earth.'[9]'Svensmark matched the data on cosmic rays from the neutron monitor in Climax, Colorado, with the satellite measurements of solar irradiance from 1970 to 1990. Over the period between 1975 and 1989, he found cosmic rays decreased by 1.2 percent annually, amplifying the sun's change in irradiance about four-fold'[6]So, as the sun's activity increases, so does the temperature. This below graph shows the correlation: [10] This graph clearly shows that temperature goes up and down with solar activity, because an increase in solar activity directly correlates with an increase in average temperature 1-2 years later. And as a final side note, I would like to present this graph that helps disprove the anthropogenic cause theory, regarding again, ocean temperature anomalies: [4]So 'nature' created the same temperature trend as 'humans' did. </t>

    <t>Hello again, I appreciate my opponent's commitment also. The debate has been interesting, if long. Unfortunately my last response was somewhat incoherent towards the end - this is because it was written at a time when I should have been asleep...I. Find the Gases that Causes the Planet to Warm I am glad that my opponent does not refute this. However, what my opponent must mean by agreeing with it is that the greenhouse effect actually exists, as I explained. If the greenhouse effect exists, then enhancement of that effect must warm the planet! My opponent states later that 'carbon dioxide does not correlate with temperature very well,' but it must if he agree with these statements.II. Ensure that those Gases Enter and Remain in the Atmosphere in Greater (or Lesser) Quantities than Beforei. Methane I agree that, relative to the natural amount of methane entering the atmosphere, the human contribution is fairly small (20%). What my opponent does not realize is that this small change can have MASSIVE effects - the CO2 and Methane (and water vapour) that are in and are cycling through our atmosphere now have been keeping the planet warm for ages, and thank goodness for that as otherwise the average temperature on earth would have been at -18 degrees celsius, that's zero degrees fahrenheit for you Americans, otherwise known as enough for the surface of the planet to be solid ice!Now we know the effects of the amount we already have (from -18 to 14, or 0 to 57 in fahrenheit) just imagine what a slight, minor increase will do... Keeping in mind that the difference between now and the last ice age is just 5 degrees celsius, that's 10 fahrenheit.Methane warms the world '20 times faster than CO2' (1) and although it is only at 1/200th of the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere (and the increase is proportional to this) that still makes methane emissions responsible for 28% of current warming.My opponent's graph is correct, saying that in 2004 methane emissions were going down. Does that preclude the idea that methane caused warming in the years before 2004, or will again? The argument is fallacious in and of itself. Also, AFTER 2004 methane emissions began to increase again, shown here. This may be because methane was trapped in arctic ice, melted by global warming. A fact, by the way, that my opponent cannot dispute - to say that global warming is not happening wrecks his own arguments, to say that there is no natural gas/methane in arctic sea ice is to contradict accepted science.II.ii. CFCsOnce more my opponent asserts that because something will not happen in the future means that it is not happening in the present or did not happen in the past. CFCs, which are entirely human synthesized, are no longer in use. This is, as I mentioned earlier, a success. Since CFCs never had the chance to warm the planet too much (though they certainly damaged the ozone layer) I added them as an afterthought on how humans are capable of changing our planet.II.iii. Nitrous OxideMy opponent's reply here is similar to his on methane, and I give a similar response - small changes in the environment can have massive effects, and my evidence is the same as well - the temperature the planet would be at without the greenhouse effect. Nitrous oxide is particularly interesting in this case because it traps heat 300x as fast as carbon dioxide. This is a phenomenal amount, but since much less nitrous oxide ends up in the atmosphere every year than carbon dioxide, it remains a lesser contributor to warming.  My opponent asserts that cows reduce nitrous oxide in the atmosphere - but by how much? The reference my opponent provided was inconclusive at best.  iv. Carbon Dioxide  My opponent's assertion here that the troposphere is not warming is, unfortunately, incorrect, as this graph should exemplify.According to Science Daily, 'The troposphere, the lower part of the atmosphere closest to the Earth, is warming and this warming is broadly consistent with both theoretical expectations and climate models, according to a new scientific study that reviews the history of understanding of temperature changes and their causes in this key atmospheric layer.'My opponent claims that his graph 'disproves the greenhouse theory' but does not recognize that the natural greenhouse effect has been warming the planet for thousands of years - he is welcome to suggest that CO2 could come from another source than humans, but to say that the greenhouse effect does not exist contradicts this (5) this (6) and this (7) and many, many other sources. In fact, the greenhouse effect itself was known to be true long before global warming, in 1824 when Joseph Fourier first expained it. You have to wonder, where else would all the CO2 go? It doesn't just disappear!My opponent is self contradictory here, as in the same argument he concurs that carbon dioxide and other gases warm the atmosphere but denies that the greenhouse effect they create exists, and furthermore denies that adding any MORE carbon dioxide would warm the atmosphere to a greater extent!If one is to study my opponent's graph here more closely, one realizes that the ppm of carbon dioxide is increasing on this graph, and quite alarmingly. In a mere 30 years it increased by 30 ppm in our entire atmosphere! This is very alarming, especially considering what I mentioned earlier, the fact that the natural amount of ppm of carbon in our atmosphere has warmed the earth 60 degrees fahrenheit and 30 celsius! I repeat again as well that the difference between now and the last ice age was 6 degrees. Thus the temperature and the ppm shown here ARE correlated, and in a very alarming way.The next graph presented is in fact a clever trick - it focus only on minor temperature changes and not on the larger picture it merely sets the information so that the lines fit. It is true, as I have mentioned that the sun causes short term variations in temperature. However, here is a graph that shows OVERALL temperatures, and thus the long term correlation between CO2 and temperature. The next piece here (A 'cooling' arctic) is simply incorrect. I can show you better than explain, but here are a few quotes anyhow.'Since 1951 the arctic has warmed twice as much as the global average' (9)'The temperature in the arctic has gone up 1.5 degrees celsius, whereas the world has gone up 0.7 degrees.''Arctic's rapid temperature rise breaks records.' (10)'Last year NASA released reports showing arctic temperatures going beyond 2010 records.' (11)For my opponent's final point, he says that global warming causes rises in CO2 levels. How? The greenhouse effect has been established, and accepted by my opponent. If CO2 levels are a a lagging indicator, then how are 1960 - 1990 on these graphs explained?II.iv. Water VapourWhat my opponent does not realize here is that temperature rises cause water vapour to increase! Therefore a 1 degree celsius rise in temperature from CO2 causes a 3 degree rise from water vapour - thermal expansion means more water evaporates.No more space - one last graph.This explains the speed of current warming best.</t>

    <t>I am here going to prove to the audience and to my opposition that global warming is primarily caused by homo sapiens and is thus a characteristic of the anthropocene - a term recently created by geologists to express 'the age of man.' I have yet to thorougly read my opponent's arguments, so anything that I write that may seem to be a rebuttal is pure coincidence. I thank my opponent for challenging me to this debate and hope for an interesting exchange of ideas. Either he'll learn something or I will!Three Steps to Damaging the Planet (Human Style)A) Find the gases that cause the planet to warmThe following gases contribute to the greenhouse effect...(10)Feedback GasesWATER VAPOURWater vapour is a 'feedback' to the climate rather than a cause of climate change. It is a greenhouse gas, but it does not contribute to a change in the greenhouse effect, rather, it changes with the temperature of the atmosphere, and thus acts as a way of telling if we're doing things right. Put simply, we on earth can't directly affect the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere, but more of it should tell us that the temperature of the planet is warming (because it evaporates. We can't heat the oceans by ourselves so we need something less direct.) and thus there's a cause - effect relationship - more CO2/Methane/etc. = Higher Temperaures = More Water VapourCausal GasesMETHANENot what you were expecting, right? But still very important. Most mammals have natural methane emissions of a kind, and this can change, so this will go into our recipe for messing with our climate. Naturally, however, it is emitted at 270 teragrams per year (9) Come back to this later.NITROUS OXIDEAlso causal to rather than resulting from a change in climate, that is, we can change how much goes into the atmosphere.CFCsThe same ones that destroy the ozone layer, this time, they're back to destroy the biosphere. I say 'destroy' because CFCs are as irrefutably man - made as CO2 and Methane are not, and therefore MUST be at least one reason that the atmosphere is warming. (Since they are artificial, to say that an increase in their quantity has non - anthropogenic causes would be like saying that trees can be made of plastic).CARBON DIOXIDEThe classic greenhouse gas. Carbon dioxide is absorbed to some extent in grass and trees (photosynthesis) on a natural level, and otherwise may be released through volcanoe and major forest fires, or the combustion of organic material. This usually accounts for 750 gigatons (8) of CO2 moving through the carbon cycle every year, not including human intervention.The gases listed here under causal warm the earth through the greenhouse effect. This is not controversial, here's how it works(7)The greenhouse effect, WITHOUT human intervention (except obviously in CFCs), is caused by the above gases in the above way. Now all we have to do is add a greedy, unenlightened species and we're on our way...B) Ensure that those gases enter and remain in the atmosphere in greater (or lesser) quantities than beforeMETHANEHumans add 330 teragrams per year (9) of methane to the atmosphere every year to the 270 teragrams already entering it, mostly through methane emitted by livestock (a single modern cow emits 270 kg of methane each year), from decay in landfills and from waste treatment, not to mention the burning of biomass. If the 330 teragrams going into the atmosphere WITHOUT humans every year causes 9% of the greenhouse effect, as noted above, then that amount doubling will, of course, ENHANCE the greenhouse effect, causing - global warming. The truth is that it would be strange if it DIDN'T. There are now 2 billion cows on the planet, far more than at any point in history. They, through methane emissions, are enhancing the greenhouse effect.CARBON DIOXIDEIt has been mentioned that 750 gigatons goes through the carbon cycle every year. Humans add 29 gigatons (8) - haha, the opposition says, the amount of human emissions of CO2 every year pale in compare to how much goes through the carbon cycle! But then one takes closer look - every year, 439 gigatons are released and 450 are absorbed by plants and trees. Suddenly, the 29 gigatons becomes much more frightening, especially when one observes that carbon dioxide is now at 390 ppm (parts per million) in the atmosphere, nearly twice as high as it has been for the last 500,000 years! The higher amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is also caused, of course, by the fact that our conversion of land for agriculture has led to land with plants that absorb less CO2 (virtually all my references will say this) so that the number of gigatons absorbed (450) is decreasing whilst the 29 is increasing, resulting in idle CO2 sitting around, warming up the atmosphere - as it must as a greenhouse gas.CO2 is poisonous as well, by the way, so even if my worthy opponent and/or audience leaves this debate with their minds unchanged on the topic of anthropogenic global warming, remember that there is still reason for CO2 emissions to be curtailed!CFCsThis is an optimistic part of the human - greenhouse effect story in that we actually stopped putting CFCs into the atmosphere when we realized how awful they were for the ozone layer. Therefore we do not put CFCs into the atmosphere any more - it's like a defunct greenhouse gas, in retirement.NITROUS OXIDENO2 has an atmospheric lifetime of 121 years (11) so naturally even a small amount of nitrous coming out of your exhaust enhances global warming for years to come. And when it's 110 to 240 thousand tonnes coming from car exhaust pipes every year, you know you have a problem. Add 2 to 4 million tonnes from fertilization practices in agriculture and you have a MAJOR problem! Add to this the fact that NO2 is 310 times as powerful as CO2 as a greenhouse gas and you have a full blown nightmare.Given the endless facts and evidence presented above, it would be strange if the atmosphere was NOT warming up from human intervention. The below only affirms what should be evident. On to our third and final step.C) Watch as the planet warms or cools six degrees, the difference between now and the last ice ageIt is often mentioned that the earth's climate has change in the past, and that is most assuredly true. It is also true, of course, that the earth's climate can change in the future, and for different reasons. However, what is unique about the warming of the anthropocene is that it has happened and is happening so suddenly, more suddenly than in the past. The closest example of climate change at this speed (just 120 years since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution), obviously excluding the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs, is the Palaeo - Eocene Thermal Maximum (13) about 55 million years ago, when the climate changed 5 to 8 degrees,that warming, of course, took several thousand years.</t>

    <t>Interesting points, Ron-Paul. Sorry for leaving the debate to the last minute, I've been rather busy of late. Thanks for taking all this time to type out a response.I. The current state of the galaxy AND the sun? That is very unusual, since they are not necessarily correlate.I.i. The Rest of the Solar SystemIt is interesting that Mars is brought up here, a planet that we don't really have information for before 1970 and that we are only scratching the surface on in terms of dust storms and their planetary effects etc. but let's look at the argument...'carbon dioxide 'ice caps' near Mars's south pole had been diminishing for three summers in a row.' Three years? How does one infer warming from this? However, I shall quote a climate science website...'This is essentially due to large scale dust storms that were common back then (1977), compared to a lower level of storminess now. The mean temperature on Mars, averaged over the Martian year can change by many degrees from year to year, depending on how active large scale dust storms are.' Thus the cause of the three - year - melting in ice caps? Dust storms, which, by the way, act like Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere.There has been no direct observation of global warming on Triton. There has been an observance of greater luminosity, but that is because Neptune does have changes (those causing Triton to seem brighter) but they are seasonal as well - a year on Neptune is 165 years on earth. Neptune is entering it's Summer.As for Jupiter, it is not warming at all. Predictions say it will warm because of storm and dust movements, not because of solar radiation. As for Pluto, we can go back to Neptune. Pluto's orbit is 248 earth years - this is like observing earth for three weeks. How do we know where it is on it's orbit? A probe has never even actually been sent to Pluto! I.ii.I agree that less cosmic rays will be hitting the earth. However, the connection between cosmic rays and cloud cover is uncertain, and, more importantly in this argument, cosmic rays do not correlate with temperature AFTER 1994 - so really this could be an argument that global warming DOES have human causes, because, as this chart shows, temperatures have gone up dramatically where cosmic rays have gone down only slightly of late.(7)II.Humans, of course, are the main internal cause of global warming!II.i.It is impossible for an ocean oscillation to create or retain heat of it's own. It merely circulates heat throughout the atmosphere and oceans, (5) which is why the atmosphere becomes warmer at some points. If you think about it, anything else would be ludicrous - currents CAUSE heat? Impossible. There are short term effects of heating in the atmosphere (and cooling) from the circulation, but what this chart shows (5) is how these circulations differ from actual changes in heat.II.ii.I refer the audience to my earlier graph, which suggests that there is no causal effect between cosmic rays and global warming over the long term. I also refer my audience to four studies that were conducted on the subject after Svensmark's 1998.... These conclude that'no statistically significant correlations were found between any of the four cloud parameters and GCR'- Kristjansson et al. (2008)'no response of global cloud cover to Forbush decreases at any altitude and latitude.' - Calogovic et al. (2010)''galactic cosmic rays appear to play a minor role for atmospheric aerosol formation events, and so for the connected aerosol-climate effects as well.' Kulmala et al. (2010)What my graph here shows is that the third (and most recent of all four studies, including my opponent's) premise would seem to be correct.III.Interestingly, the opposition's graph only goes back 1000 years. To give the audience a more holistic picture, here is one of five year averages in the northern hemisphere going back to 0 CE.What is important to take into account here is that the sun does indeed affect earth's temperature, but in different ways and at different times, and in greater amounts of time than of late. My opposition says that the Medieval Warming Period was warmer than today, however, this is not so. The misinterpretation of data is a result of the restrictedness of the data - most of it was taken in the North Atlantic and Greenland, where various forms of paleoatmospheric research show that it was indeed much warmer today. HOWEVER, in the tropical Pacific it was much cooler than today. Overall, as my graph has shown, we have reached global temperatures that are on average MUCH warmer than the averages of the Medieval Warming period!And here is another graph similar to that of my opponent but more specific....Different colours showing different areas/forms of evidence from a variety of sources.All in all what I am saying here is that in 1950 my opposition could have seemed quite correct in his graphing, with perhaps a few discrepancies concerning the rapidity of temperature increase. However, it has CONTINUED to warm, and this is what is worrying to scientists. It continues to warm to the point that, if it should continue at current rates, the earthly survival of plants and animals may be threatened.IV.Another used - to - be - true argument. Once more, this graph shows that over the past several decades, temperature and solar activity have gone in opposite directions. Why is this? Because of the anthropogenic effect. Note that this following graph deals with WORLD temperatures rather than US specific, which are neither accurate nor credible as evidence of global climate as a whole. (Different places on earth experience different warmings/coolings at different times.V.This point is, I believe, backed by flawed logic - both are cases of warming, but with different causes. If a logger pull out an axe and chops down a tree, then points to a tree that fell naturally and says 'the tree that I just chopped down fell naturally because it looks the same as the other one' would you believe the logger's 'logic' or would you believe what you saw with your own eyes?There would seem to be many poins here that are not correlated (thus making them all true to be more unlikely) and many that do not seem to be backed by credible research. There have been many causes of warming on a global level in the past, humans are just another. And we are a natural cause because, contrary to what blind followers of the religion that externalities to short term profits do not exist, governments, businesses, and individuals are fallible and can cause problems on an environmental scale.However, I appreciate my opponent's points and look forward to reading his criticisms of mine.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank my opponent for presenting his arguments. I. Find the Gases that Causes the Planet to Warm My opponent here is just presenting the different gases. This is an observation, not an argument. We will differ when anthropogenic arguments are presented. II. Ensure that those Gases Enter and Remain in the Atmosphere in Greater (or Lesser) Quantities than BeforeII.i. Methane Human contribution to methane concentrations is actually rather small:  [1]And even if human causation was the main factor of methane concentrations, the amount of methane increase has actually been decreasing, and is now decreasing:[2]Notice that during the infamous 'hockey stick' (I will get to that later) times, methane increases were actually decreasing. So, not only are humans relatively small causes of methane concentrations, but methane amounts are actaully decreasing at this point. II.ii. CFCs Even though CFCs are mostly man-made in origin, there concentrations have been decreasing also: [3]Again, just like methane amounts, during the main warming times, CFCs concentration increases were decreasing, and are now negative. II.iii. Nitrous Oxide As with methane, human contributions to nitrous oxide are very small:[1]In fact, ocean amoeba are a major cause of nitrous oxide: 'Dr Trimmer looked at nitrous oxide production in the Arabian Sea, which accounts for up to 18 % of global ocean emissions. He found that the gas is primarily produced by bacteria trying to make nitrogen gas.'[4] And that is just the Arabian Sea. And even if cows did cause a lot of warming: '...a new study found that cattle grazed on the grasslands of China actually reduce another greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide.'[5] So, humans are positive in this aspect. II.iv. Carbon DioxideThis will be my main point.First, by the greenhouse effect, global warming should be starting from the lower atmosphere and moving to the surface, but this is not happening: '...satellite and high-altitude balloon data confirm that the lower atmosphere is not trapping lots of additional heat due to higher CO2 concentrations. It is hard to know how fast the Earth's highly variable surface is warming, but it is warming faster than the lower atmosphere where the CO2 is accumulating. This is strong evidence that CO2 is not the primary climate factor.'[6]Here is a graph relating to the point, showing the decrease in upper troposphere temperature anomalies, disproving the greenhouse theory here:  [7]Second, CO2 levels do not correlate with temperature very well: 'In the last decade, there has been no clear warming trend (as the UK Met Office and IPCC’s own figures demonstrate). In the last century, much of the warming occurred prior to 1940, when human emissions of CO2 were relatively small compared to today. During the post-war economic boom (when one would have expected the temperature to rise) the world cooled, from the 1940s till the mid-70s (again, this is evident from accepted data used by the IPCC).'[8]Here is a graph showing the fallacy of the CO2-temperature correlation:   [9]As shown, CO2 does not correlate with temperature. This next graph compares solar activity and CO2 to temperature. It is easy to see which one correlates with temperature more:  [10] Third, global warming is not starting at the poles like it should be, by the greenhouse theory. In fact, there has been general, relative cooling: 'If the greenhouse thoery were valid, temperatures in the Arctic and the Antarctic would have risen several degrees Celsius since 1940 due to the huge emissions of man-made CO2... Recently, a team led by the University of Chicago's Peter Doran published a paper in Nature saying, 'Although previous reports suggest recent continental warming, our spatial analysis of Antarctic meteorological data demonstrates a net cooling on the Antarctic continent between 1966 and 2000'. The data from 21 Antarctic surface stations show an average continental decline of 0.008 degrees C from 1978 to 1998, and the infrared data from satellites operating since 1979 show a decline of 0.42 degrees C per decade. David W. J. Thompson of Colorado State University and Susan Soloman of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration also report a cooling trend in the Antarctic interior. ... report that satellite imaging shows increases in Souther Ocean sea ice parameters from 1978 to 1996 and an increase in the length of the sea-ice season in the 1990s'[6]'Greenland has also been growing colder over the last half-century...''... examined the temperatures for the entire Arctic for 1951 to 1990, he [Rajmund Przybylak, Polish climatologist] reported, 'no tangible manifestations of the greenhouse effect [could] be identified'[6]  This graph shows the arctic temperatures. The blue line is the melt point. Clearly, it spends little time there: [11]This graph shows that Antarctic sea ice extent is rising:   [12] Fourth and finally, CO2 is a lagging indicator: '...the CO2 changes have lagged about 800 years behind the temperuatre changes. Global warming has produced more CO2, rather than more CO2 producing global warming.'[6] So, the theory is reversed. CO2 does not cause global warming, but vice versa. II.v. Water Vapor    Believe it or not, the four gases mentioned above actually make up about 5% of all greenhouse gases. The other 95% is natural made water vapor:    [1]So all of the other gases' contribution to global warming is almost negligible compared to water vapor. II.vi. Conclusion   'Just how much of the 'Greenhouse Effect' is caused by human activity?  It is about 0.28%, if water vapor is taken into account-- about 5.53%, if not.'III. Watch as the Planet Warms or Cools Six Degrees, the Difference between Now and the Last Ice Age 'During the last 150 years there has been another fairly sustained period of global warming amounting to an increase of about 0.7 degree Celsius. In spite of rhetoric to the contrary, the majority of this warming took place naturally before 1940. This warming trend was interrupted by a 35-year cooling period from 1940 to 1975. This caused many climatologists to actually predict that we were entering another ice age. At that time the public was obsessed with “global cooling.” Today, our obsession is “global warming.'[13] Still, today's global warming is nothing new, in fact, it is not even that big.</t>

    <t>Global climate change according to me is manmade. Climate change or global warming, according to me, is here as a result of our misdeeds- like deforestation, burning of fossil fuels, emission of carbon dioxide and other harmful greenhouse gases. Forests have the ability to convert carbon dioxide into oxygen and we are removing them, throwing them out of our planet for our own betterment- for land, for fuel, for medicinal purposes and etc. While doing this we, knowingly or unknowingly, cut off the planet's "lungs". So as an answer to our deforestation, mother earth gives us GLOBAL WARMING! Mankind's burning of fossil fuels causes a warming tendency in the atmosphere- global warming. The mainly used fuel coal when burnt releases huge numbers of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere making it unfit to breathe in, and also causing greenhouse effect.It has now been proven that as a result to our blasting millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide has increased the temperature by 4 degree Celsius, since the 1950's. This increase in temperature is because of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (released by our activities) which trap heat and make the earth HOTTER. These greenhouse gases also deplete the ozone layer which protects us from harmful UV rays and the immense heat released by the sun. Now, this depletion has grown to such an extent that we have a hole in the ozone layer resulting in an increasing temperature. With reference to all the points I have mentioned above, I can conclude that GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE (GLOBAL WARMING) IS MANMADE!</t>

    <t>What the historic record shows is that yes, climate change has been occurring since the planet's formation. What it does not show, is the planet abruptly warming in less than a century, at exactly the same time that there is extensive CO2 emissions by an sentient species.  In fact, what most people don't realise is that we are technically still in an ice age that began a few million years ago. Having an ice sheet on an empty polar ocean is unusual compared to Earth's past. However, just because the planet has once had a hotter environment does not mean modern species can live in this environment, or adapt to it.  Anthropogenic Global Warming is a thing.

    <t>I accept the definitions brought forth by the Proposition, however I would like to point out that the definition of 'Sustainable' can be interpreted differently by different people. For the purposes of this debate, I will act under the assumption that 'Sustainable' means the ability for a natural resource to endure. Following this definition, I find that some of my opponent's arguments are off topic and unrelated. Sustainability in this debate refers to the ability for the trees to endure. The loss of animals or plants; though regretted, does not affect the sustainability of the trees.  Furthermore, I am not aware if this is a Policy or Values debate or if those types of debate even exist on Debate.org. Therefore, I would greatly appreciate it if the Proposition cleared that up but I will act under the assumption that this is a Values debate as the Proposition has not already brought forth a plan. I would like to point out some flaws in my opponent's case before I get into my constructive arguments:  In my opponent's first point, he mentioned how the felling of a certain type of tree in a certain area will lead to the decrease of biological diversity. But this is simply not true. It is true that selective logging focuses on a specific type of tree, but not every tree in an area is felled. For example, if loggers decided to log down oak trees they would not cut down every oak tree within a square kilometer. Animals will not lose their food supply as only trees of harvestable size are harvested. Any young tree is left alone to continue the biodiversity and to continue supporting the animals in the region.  My opponent also mentioned plants living the tree that is felled would be damaged and undergrowth would be squashed. However, this is true with any sort of deforestation yet with selective logging the damage is reduced greatly compared to clear cut logging as not every tree is cut down. Furthermore, loggers attempt to guide the tree to the ground, minimizing damage to the undergrowth.  In the second point, my opponent explained how the micro climate would be affected by the logging of certain trees. However, the climate change would be extremely minimal as only certain trees are cut down. Furthermore, after logging loggers generally will reforest the trees that they have logged down with the same species of tree providing more canopies to minimize climate change.  Finally, my opponent mentioned the destruction caused by the building of roads. However, the construction of roads is prohibited in National Forests. There are various other ways of transporting felled logs out of an area that does not harm the environment in a serious way. For example, heli-logging uses helicopters to vertically lift the log out of an area.  My opponent has also mentioned that areas that have been previously selectively logged have a higher chance of being logged in the future. However, that is the purpose of reforestation and selective logging and I will be getting more into this point in my constructive arguments.  I would also like to point out that while selective logging is not perfect; it is a far better option than other forms of logging and far more sustainable. Though selective logging may remove an area the size of Connecticut, but clear-cutting would remove an area many times greater.  I will now continue on to my first contention, which is that the main factor influencing selective logging's ability to be sustainable is the logging methods and reforestation. I will present my second, third, and fourth contention in the respective rounds.  Loggers are aware of the environmental damage caused by clear-cut logging. That is why selective-logging was created. The idea is that some of the trees that are suitable for logging will be logged and the younger trees will remain untouched. The purpose of this is for those young trees to grow into the large trees that were cut down. This way, after several years the loggers can return to cut down those younger trees that weren't cut before. Once again, they don't touch the younger trees. Several years later, these loggers return. This cycle continues, ensuring a sustainable source of trees. We can compare the trees to the life cycle of a human. In the forest, there are middle-aged trees, young adult trees, and then teenage trees. The middle-aged are removed and new babies are inserted. The young adults grow into the middle-aged, the teenage grow into the young adults, and the babies grow into teenagers. The middle-aged are removed…  Not only that, but reforestation efforts are increasing. New saplings are planted in the areas that have been logged already, thus the cycle becomes continuous. Brazil projects to have reforested 1 billion trees by the year 2013. Thus, we will have near limitless supplies of trees, clearly a living embodiment of the term 'Sustainable'. So what have we learned today? We learned that through logging and reforestation, we can achieve a balance between the rates of logging and the rates of growth in young trees.

    <t>For a very long time, selective logging has been cited as an environmentally friendly alternative to clear cutting. However, increasing evidence is revealing that this is not the case. As such, I would like to instigate a debate on this matter.  The first round is for acceptance as well as some arguments. The second, third and fourth rounds are for arguments and rebuttals. The final round is for drawing a conclusion.  Definitions: Selective logging - The practice of removing only certain desired trees in an area, leaving the rest intact. Clear cutting - The practice of removing all trees in an area, selecting the appropriate wood afterwards. Sustainable - 'Our Common Future' definition Deforestation - the land use conversion of a plot of land from a forest to other uses.  Let me now begin my arguments.  Firstly, selective logging affects surrounding organisms. When trees are cut down, plants such as vines, lianas, strangler figs and parasites which rely on the felled tree will have to go as well. Moreover, felled trees will damage surrounding trees, as well as the undergrowth. (1) This reduces the biomass of the forest.  If only trees of a certain species are targeted, their disappearance in that area will lead to a decrease on the biodiversity of the area. Many animals species in forests rely on a scarce food supply and the disappearance of one species of trees may cut off their main food supply. (1) The energy flow of the rainforest will be disrupted and lower in complexity. The resilience stability of the rainforest is lowered.  Secondly, selective logging affects the microclimate of the clearing. The canopy prevents radiation loss, increases relative humidity and lowers wind speed. Without the canopy layer, sunlight can penetrate directly to the forest floor in the daytime, and heat loss will be faster at night. The diurnal range of temperature will be enlarged. The alteration of the habitat will render the clearing uninhabitable to the original inhabitants. At the same time, species that were originally unable to inhabit the area will invade the forest. For example, as the sunlight can reach the ground directly, the undergrowth will become much thicker. This change in ecosystem disrupts the ecological balance and pushes the ecosystem away from a state of equilibrium. (1)  Direct exposure of the soil to sunlight also causes dries up the soil. The loss of litter also intensifies the rainsplash effect and leads to soil erosion in the clearing. The hydrological cycle is damaged as evapotranspiration is reduced and the soil water content is lowered. (1) Studies have shown that selectively logged forests are more prone to droughts and fires even after years of regeneration. (3)  Thirdly, roads created will bring massive damage to the forest. Roads divide the forest into many segments, which affects the migration of animals. Many species of animals can only live along the margins of forests. (1) As the number of roads increases, these animals can breed at a faster rate than is normally allowed as they can also live along the roads. In fact, many logging companies use the increasing numbers of such species to 'prove' that they are not harming the environment. (4) However, this phenomenon is very destructive as the overbreeding of animals used to forest fringes and the depletion of those who prefer the interior will lower the biodiversity and the ecological integrity of the forest. (1)  Perhaps most importantly, the introduction of roads improves the accessibility of the rainforest, thereby encouraging further exploitation of the forest. Many equatorial regions are rich in rainforest resources. These countries are usually poor. Unemployed and homeless people can follow the roads left behind from selective logging and open up the forest to live and cultivate there. (1) Roads also favour clear-cutting. For example, a 2006 study showed that selective logging increases the likelihood of forests being cleared at a later date. 16% of the selectively logged forests are cleared in a year, and a further 5.4% each subsequent year for another four years. (3)  Finally, selective logging itself causes the logging of a giant number of trees. Every year, selective logging in the Brazilian Amazon clears an area of rainforest equivalent to the size of Connecticut. (2)  Despite the many benefits it is thought to bring, selective logging is only the lesser of two evils - and one that will lead to the greater evil too. It is not good news for the biomes which contain half of our world's species among them.

    <t>Thank you, iwillannoyo, for accepting the debate.  Firstly, let me post the 'Our Common Future' definition of 'sustainable' lest my opponent should have any difficulty finding it.  'Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.'  In other words, sustainable development refers not only to the sustainability of trees, but also of the forest ecosystem, its energy flow, nutrient cycle, ecological pyramids, and such. In addition to environmental concerns, sustainability must also take into account social and economic sustainability.  Let me then refute my opponent's counter-arguments.  Firstly, even though the loggers only cut down the stronger and older trees, the removal of such trees reduces the genetic diversity of that type of tree within the area. Furthermore, as these trees have better genes than the weak ones that are left uncut, the stronger genes are removed from the gene pool. This means the existence of this type of tree in the area is more vulnerable than before. Moreover, since only weaker and younger trees are left in the area, the animals which rely on the trees for food will lose a major portion of their food supply.  Secondly, because of the continuous nature of the canopy, felled trees, especially taller trees (i.e. emergents and canopy trees), inevitably damage surrounding trees, even with techniques such as directional tree felling. It is estimated that for every tree logged, thirty are hurt. Furthermore, the stability of the trees are lowered as the networks of vines are disrupted. (2)  In response to the fact that loggers sometimes reforest the trees after logging, forests after selective logging are generally unable to regenerate quickly because trees need a lot of sunlight to regrow. A large, open area where all of the sunlight can reach the ground directly is more favourable for regrowth. Moreover, loggers often do not wait enough time for the trees to grow again. The loggers of the Amazon are one such example. (3) This shows that economic and environmental sustainability conflict when it comes to selective logging. Also, machinery involved in logging always damages trees. (1 and 2) Studies have also shown that selectively logged areas are more susceptible to forest fires. (5)  Although it is against the law to construct roads in national forests, anti-logging laws are often not carried out because of various reasons, including collusion between the government and corporations, bribery and corruption, and lack of manpower. The Brazil Environmental Protection Agency, for example, only collects 6.5% of the fines it imposes. Moreover, every inspector in Brazil has to look after 41 000 square kilometres of forest. Therefore, it is difficult to monitor logging activities. (1) Even in democratic countries such as the United States, collusion between the private sector and government officials is a serious problem. Moreover, multinational corporations from the United States, Britain, France, Belgium and Japan often try to control government officials of developing countries in order to log illegally. (4)  I will not refute the constructive arguments put forward by my opponent because I believe I have sufficiently addressed these points in the arguments above.</t>

    <t>Global warming is a natural cycle and human kind has played only a small role in it, but that doesn't mean that we should stop protecting the environment</t>
<h>Natural cycles:This argument is about solar cycles (as well as other cycles). This is one of the more common arguments in the global warming debate. There are many longer solar cycles, but there are sometimes shorter ones (1500 years +/- 500). We are actually in an ice age, but a section called an interglacial. (like a temporary break). This is much of modern history, and in those 15,000 years it seems as though we have perfectly fit into this 1500 year cycle, and the funny thing is we are in the middle of the cycle as we speak. It will soon end, but this warming is expected. Now the significance to this cycle is it perfectly explains global warming, accelerated heating then cooling. [1] This perfectly explains the 'unprecedented' warming. Also:http://www.isil.org... (scroll down about halfway and see graph)Looks like a natural cycle to me, and very predictable. Furthermore:'In 2005 data from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor and Odyssey missions revealed that the carbon dioxide 'ice caps' near Mars's south pole had been diminishing for three summers in a row. Habibullo Abdussamatov, head of space research at St. Petersburg's Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory in Russia, says the Mars data is evidence that the current global warming on Earth is being caused by changes in the sun.' http://news.nationalgeographic.com... Another reason is the earths position in the milky way. Every 135 million years we enter a more populated area in the galaxy and hit more cosmic rays which make clouds, and therefore cooling. Currently we are in a les populated branch, and the less rays mean we will inevitably be warmer/warming. [2] Wind and ocean currents also play a LARGE role in heating/cooling. http://www.climate-skeptic.com...Sums it up. (scroll down to PDO warm and cool) Problems with the greenhouse theoryNow, we (If I decide to argue greenhouse) can attribute warming to other gases, and I still win the debate as I prove it not human CO2 enduced. In this contention I argue water vapor causes much of the warming. Basically to sum up what I would have said in many paragraphs:'However, the most potent greenhouse gas is water, explains Shaidurov and it is this compound on which his study focuses. According to Shaidurov, only small changes in the atmospheric levels of water, in the form of vapour and ice crystals can contribute to significant changes to the temperature of the earth's surface, which far outweighs the effects of carbon dioxide and other gases released by human activities. Just a rise of 1% of water vapour could raise the global average temperature of Earth's surface more then 4 degrees Celsius.'http://phys.org... Also if the theory was true, the north and south polls would be seeing increased meltings and be seeing large temperture spikes. I contend the pols have had little to no warming. I think this observation is common knowlege. More stuff'That means that less than 2/1,000 of all CO2 is produced by human activity. So even if we wiped out every car, power plant, jet liner, and human being from the face of the earth, there would be no noticeable effect on global CO2 levels.'http://www.isil.org... Further if CO2 was a climate factor, if we saw natural increases in CO2 there would also be natural rises in temperature hundreds of years ago, and there is no correlation, therefore the correlation fails on a scientific basis. Using figure 2.4 in source (2) we observe no statistical correlation, CO2 is low temperature may be high or vice versa. This right here disproves the theory. (If CO2 actually had an impact, natural increases would also raise temperature, it did not, hence it has no correlation)..Also CO2 lags temperture. If CO2 was a cause it would happen before the rise, hence even if it is a natural increase we should see an increase in temp, we dont, hence there is no correlation.

Further, correlation does not equal causation, something my opponent has brushed over many times. Also, the last few hundred years are the only correlation they can gather up, and there is none. My opponents quote only works if they find a correlation for thousands of years, but there is NONE. Further, my opponent forgets CO2 may cause COOLING. Yes, cooling. This says it better then I can: 'Carbon dioxide is a powerful aerial fertilizer, directly enhancing the growth of almost all terrestrial plants and many aquatic plants as its atmospheric concentration rises. And just as increased algal productivity at sea increases the emission of sulfur gases to the atmosphere, ultimately leading to more and brighter clouds over the world's oceans, so too do CO2-induced increases in terrestrial plant productivity lead to enhanced emissions of various sulfur gases over land, where they likewise ultimately cool the planet. In addition, many non-sulfur-based biogenic materials of the terrestrial environment play major roles as water- and ice-nucleating aerosols; and the airborne presence of these materials should also be enhanced by rising levels of atmospheric CO2. Hence, it is possible that incorporation of this multifaceted CO2-induced cooling effect into the suite of equations that comprise the current generation of global climate models might actually tip the climatic scales in favor of global cooling in the face of continued growth of anthropogenic CO2 emissions.'[1]My opponent then cites a graph again to show humans make most of the CO2, well I will cite another graph:Natural made CO2 - 3.502% Man made - 0.117% (based on concentrations, the graph is not based on concentrations)[2] My opponents soruce for this is nasa, not to be rude but nasa? Way to find a bias source. They source the IPCC, political funded motivated etc. And again, many non bias eer reviewed studies actually prove (as well as canadian government estimates) the same data I am finding. [2] III. 'Proof'Pretty much drops my line of argunmentation. Further, he has still filed to find correlation, cause he cant. As I have nothing to refute here, here are graphs:Short term - No correlation. CO2 rises, tempertures begin to fall? No correlation, either. My oppoent fails on all accounts. Cycles:Mentioned above? Look at the fact I have been spewing. Note older cycles are warmer then today without CO2 from human causes. My opponent quotes, as will I:'Over 95% of the greenhouse effect is the result of water vapor in Earth's atmosphere. But because water droplets held in suspension (clouds) make almost as good a reflector as they do a thermal insulator, there is little rise in daytime temperatures due to the greenhouse effect. '[3]source 2Why is it like this? water vapor = most abundant and most powerful. Note, water vapor is 99.999% natural. [2]source 2CONCLUSION:My responses seem short, but I think m graphs do the talking, a picture is worth 1000 words. Before anyoen votes on this debate, I recomend the re look II on pros 'proof' this round. Problems with my opponents case:a) he finds no current or long term correlation of CO2 and temperture [I did both]b) forgets water vapor is the most powerful and abundant greenhouse gas, and is 99.999% naturalc) forgets the influenc of the PDO ocean cycles in temperture. My opponent dropped these argunments:Mars is heating as well, leading to suspect sun causes gloabl warming. Crucial in the debate. We are in a part of the galaxy where we will get more heating (less populated area = more heat, natural cause)PDO and other ocean currents causing global warmingMy opponent has failed to fufill his BOP in this debate. </t>

    <t>I want to thank you for allowing me to debate this.I. What is a greenhouse gas? A greenhouse gas is a gas that traps heat in the atmosphere that prevents the head from escaping the earth.[1] There are several gasses that are commonly called 'greenhouse gas' such as: [2]   Carbon Dioxide (CO2): Carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels (oil, natural gas, and coal), solid waste, trees and wood products, and also as a result of other chemical reactions (e.g., manufacture of cement). Carbon dioxide is also removed from the atmosphere (or “sequestered”) when it is absorbed by plants as part of the biological carbon cycle. Methane (CH4): Methane is emitted during the production and transport of coal, natural gas, and oil. Methane emissions also result from livestock and other agricultural practices and by the decay of organic waste in municipal solid waste landfills. Nitrous Oxide (N2O): Nitrous oxide is emitted during agricultural and industrial activities, as well as during combustion of fossil fuels and solid waste. Fluorinated Gases: Hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride are synthetic, powerful greenhouse gases that are emitted from a variety of industrial processes. Fluorinated gases are sometimes used as substitutes for ozone-depleting substances (i.e., CFCs, HCFCs, and halons). These gases are typically emitted in smaller quantities, but because they are potent greenhouse gases, they are sometimes referred to as High Global Warming Potential gases (“High GWP gases”).  Of all these, CO2 makes up the vast majority of 56% [3] My partner already defined a CO2 emission so I've no need to go into that. II. What does a greenhouse gas do? A greenhosue gas locks in the heat from the sun causing what is known as a greenhouse effect.  III. Proof that humans are the main cause of global warming I wanted to establish what a greenhouse gas was and how it worked; however, that is not the resolution. We are wanting to know whether or not humans are the main cause. My contention is that global warming is mainly caused by CO2 emissions via human activities. According to the USCS, we know that humans are the cause of global warming for at least 3 reasons (their words in italics): [4] Human fingerprints on Carbon overoad - When humans burn coal, oil, and gas to generate electricity or drive cars, CO2 is released int o the atmosphere, where it traps heat. A carbon molecule that comes from fossil fules and deforestastion is lighter than the combined signals of those from other sources. Natural changes alone cannot explain the temperature changes we've seen - My partner rightfully points out that there is a natural explanation for some of the temperature changes we have seen. However, nature alone cannot account for such changes. For a computer model to accurately project the future climate, scientists must first ensure that it is accurately reproduces the observed temperature changes. However, when the models include only recorded natural climate drivers (i.e., the sun's intensity), the models cannot accurately reproduce the observed warming of the previous 50 years. When human-induced climate drivers are also included in the models, then they accurately capture recent temperature increases in the atmosphere and in the oceans. When all the natural and human-induced climate drivers are compared to one another, the dramatic accumulation of carbon from human sources is by far the largest climate change driver over the past half century. Lower-level atmosphere — which contains the carbon load—is expanding. The boundary between the lower atmosphere (troposphere) and the higher atmosphere (stratosphere) has shifted upward in recent decades. See the ozone FAQ for a figure illustrating the layers of the atmosphere. This boundary has likely changed because heat-trapping gases accumulate in the lower atmosphere and that atmospheric layer expands as it heats up (much like warming the air in a balloon). And because less heat is escaping into the higher atmosphere, it is likely cooling. This differential would not occur if the sun was the sole climate driver, as solar changes would warm both atmospheric layers, and certainly would not have warmed one while cooling the other. ConclusionC1: Natural cycles alone cannot account for the climate change that we observe;C2: CO2 is a main cause of Greenhouse Gas within the Atmosphere.C3: Activities that humans do on a regular basis emit CO2 into the atmosphere contributing to greenhouse gas.Resolution affirmed.</t>

    <t>Natural cycles:This argument is about solar cycles (as well as other cycles). This is one of the more common arguments in the global warming debate. There are many longer solar cycles, but there are sometimes shorter ones (1500 years +/- 500). We are actually in an ice age, but a section called an interglacial. (like a temporary break). This is much of modern history, and in those 15,000 years it seems as though we have perfectly fit into this 1500 year cycle, and the funny thing is we are in the middle of the cycle as we speak. It will soon end, but this warming is expected. Now the significance to this cycle is it perfectly explains global warming, accelerated heating then cooling. [1] This perfectly explains the 'unprecedented' warming. Looks like a natural cycle to me, and very predictable. Furthermore:'In 2005 data from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor and Odyssey missions revealed that the carbon dioxide 'ice caps' near Mars's south pole had been diminishing for three summers in a row. Habibullo Abdussamatov, head of space research at St. Petersburg's Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory in Russia, says the Mars data is evidence that the current global warming on Earth is being caused by changes in the sun.' Another reason is the earths position in the milky way. Every 135 million years we enter a more populated area in the galaxy and hit more cosmic rays which make clouds, and therefore cooling. Currently we are in a les populated branch, and the less rays mean we will inevitably be warmer/warming. [2] Wind and ocean currents also play a LARGE role in heating/cooling. Sums it up. (scroll down to PDO warm and cool) Problems with the greenhouse theoryNow, we (If I decide to argue greenhouse) can attribute warming to other gases, and I still win the debate as I prove it not human CO2 enduced. In this contention I argue water vapor causes much of the warming. Basically to sum up what I would have said in many paragraphs:'However, the most potent greenhouse gas is water, explains Shaidurov and it is this compound on which his study focuses. According to Shaidurov, only small changes in the atmospheric levels of water, in the form of vapour and ice crystals can contribute to significant changes to the temperature of the earth's surface, which far outweighs the effects of carbon dioxide and other gases released by human activities. Just a rise of 1% of water vapour could raise the global average temperature of Earth's surface more then 4 degrees Celsius.' Also if the theory was true, the north and south polls would be seeing increased meltings and be seeing large temperture spikes. I contend the pols have had little to no warming. I think this observation is common knowlege. More stuff'That means that less than 2/1,000 of all CO2 is produced by human activity. So even if we wiped out every car, power plant, jet liner, and human being from the face of the earth, there would be no noticeable effect on global CO2 levels.' Further if CO2 was a climate factor, if we saw natural increases in CO2 there would also be natural rises in temperature hundreds of years ago, and there is no correlation, therefore the correlation fails on a scientific basis. Using figure 2.4 in source (2) we observe no statistical correlation, CO2 is low temperature may be high or vice versa. This right here disproves the theory. (If CO2 actually had an impact, natural increases would also raise temperature, it did not, hence it has no correlation)..Also CO2 lags temperture. If CO2 was a cause it would happen before the rise, hence even if it is a natural increase we should see an increase in temp, we dont, hence there is no correlation.

    <t>I. What a greenhouse gas isThis is more of an observation rather than a argument. I agree with you on what these emissions are, but differ on if they are the principle cause of global warming. II. The greenhouse effect Now lets first look on how much heat will be forced to stay. CO2 is like a sheet of plastic, it only absorbed 8% of the radiation. So only 8% is temporarily trapped, ok? Only 1% of the things leaving the atmosphere is heat. So based on simple math we can see these small numbers will unlikely be able to create any major 'unprecedented' global warming.And there is more math that makes it seem impossible that CO2 is a factor. I will make this into a quiz like my source 1 does:The percentage of CO2 in the atmosphere is [1]: a) over 10%b) 5-10%c) 1-5%d) less then 1%Any wagers? You guessing c? Its 'd'. Less then 1%. Human contribution to CO2:a) over 20%b) 10-20%c) 5-10%d) less then 5%The answer is 'd' again, in a 2-5% range depending on the stats. Now why is this important and actually crippling to my opponents case? Here is why:Carbon is .04% of atmosphere. Lets say humans make about 4% of that. That means .0016%. This means human contribution to the atmosphere in carbon is a mere 16 ppm (parts per million), or 1.6 out of 100,000.So lets assume CO2 can heat to a large extent. But the CO2 in this analogy is people. There are 100,000 people in a room, heating it up. We add 1.6 people or remove 1.6 people. That will have no measurable effects. If I argued it did it would be absurd right? Same with CO2. With the low amount humans are adding it is absurd CO2 is the main cause of the warming. [1]III. 'Proof'1. CO2 does trap heat, but as mentioned:a) Not that muchb) 1.6/100,000 will have little effect. 2. My opponent agrees natural factors are some of the warming, but CO2 is still a larger component. My opponent claims we must show CO2 to make an accurate computer model. But in reality that makes no sense. Unless you are trying to get a non-existent correlation. If you look at these models in the past, they actually refute the points that CO2 causes warming. Temperatures may be warmer then today's, but have lower CO2 numbers. That's something the alarmist crowd has been trying to hide. And my opponent claims there has been a correlation of CO2 and temperatures in the last century. But lets look at facts: 'In the last decade, there has been no clear warming trend (as the UK Met Office and IPCC’s own figures demonstrate). In the last century, much of the warming occurred prior to 1940, when human emissions of CO2 were relatively small compared to today.' [2]3. I have already shown the absurdity of this, using facts and numbers that where easy to comprehend. CO2 blocks little and has no/little possible effect. It may be likely other stronger gases are creating this (N2O or methane) but unlikely CO2. Also where the atmosphere is relates more with air pressure. ******Natural cycle My opponent can't really salvage his case, as in reality science is against him. He would have to have to prove unprecedented, as he claims CO2 cannot make all of this heat. Well natural factors did it WITHOUT HUMAN CO2. Here is a graph:As we can see the earth does this all the time without human CO2. So the question that refutes and destroys my opponents case is: Why not now? His only possible arunment is that it is 'unprecidented'. But those argunments are bound to fail. CONCLUSION:Pretty much read II and III. The science is against my opponent.

    <t>After looking at the evidence, I concede this debate. Good debate to both sides!</t>
<h>I am going to try something that I have not done for a year. Instead of doing a specific line-by-line, I will be using this round to crystallize my position because I do not think that my opponent really made a substantive effort to attack my position in this round. That does mean that I am dropping anything; I will cover the flow as I tell the “story of the round”. Before I begin, however, I would like to address this argument that my opponent makes about 0.2% of the greenhouse effect being due to humans. I have no idea where she got this from; she did not source this statistic, so I cannot explain why the methodology of the statistic was wrong. Moreover, some of her other sources contradict this argument and statistic, so there is no reason to accept it. CyclesThis round rests on whether or not global warming has an impact. As my observation noted, as long as my opponent believes that there is any type of climate change, global warming necessarily has to exist. This means that even if my opponent has convinced you that global warming is entirely a natural process, she does not win this debate. She needs to demonstrate that the impacts of that process are meaningless, so any discussion of whether or not it is artificial is tangential to the real debate. This observation has been dropped since Round 3. My opponent has maintained throughout this round that any climate change is a result of a cycle.This means that she concedes that global warming does exist in some form. I also agree that cycles exist. I provided evidence in Round 1 that demonstrate that there are cycles every 100,000 years in which carbon levels peak at 285 ppm. According to my evidence, we reached this peak in 1850. That means, according to the cycles, we should not only have reduced carbon levels at the moment, but that we should also be witnessing a reduction in temperature and a reduction in carbon levels. The evidence that I cited notes that our carbon levels are currently increasing at an exponentially high rate and are going against the trends established by the cycle. My opponent then proceeded to not only reject my evidence based on time period, but to also concede that her own evidence did not examine the Earth’s history properly. She completely dropped the argument that I made, however, about how since the cycles last 100,000 years, my evidence, which extends back 600,000 years, is enough to see the trends. Moreover, if she is rejecting her own evidence, she has no basis for for making the claim that global climate change is natural because she has nothing to back up her arguments. She already conceded that her evidence is false, and she did not provide any more evidence to support her assertions. This itself is a reason to accept my evidence because she has not provided any sort of alternative studies that she considers to be more accurate. Ergo, she cannot make her unsupported assertions.While discussing another argument, opponent did provide us with evidence that examines that past 500 million years. Happily, that evidence supports my position. It explicitly notes, “Raising atmospheric CO2 level at a rate of 2ppm/year, a pace unprecedented in the geological record, with the exception of the effects of CO2 released from craters excavated by large asteroid impacts, the deleterious effects of pollution and deforestation have reached a geological dimension, tracking towards conditions which existed on Earth in the mid-Pliocene, about 2.8 million years ago.' Her own evidence is literally telling you that the only time that we have had such rapid increases in CO2 levels was when massive asteroids collided with Earth. Ergo, by her own evidence, which examines the past 500 million years, these levels are only reached artificially, and are not a natural part of the cycle. This was entirely dropped by my opponent. That should be enough to tell you that the global warming we are experiencing is an artificial phenomenon. ImpactsI discussed three impacts of global warming that demonstrate that it is, in fact, an issue. The first impact was that there will be a 30% decrease in the flora and fauna species of this planet. Her only response to this was natural selection allows for the best adapted species to survive. She still has not responded to the rights analysis that I posted in Round 1. Even if the beings who are most fit to survive will survive, that does not mean that we are justified in committing acts that will cause the destruction of 30% of Earth’s species because they have a right to survive. Natural adaptation and competition is one thing, but specifically causing harms to those species is another. It’s the difference between chopping someone’s leg off and seeing someone being born with a birth defect. One is natural and is not our fault. The other is something that we are doing actively and is a violation of rights. The second impact was the increase in natural disasters due to an increase in heat waves. She continuously asserts that global warming does not cause natural disasters. First, I would like to point out that in Round 4, she conceded that the evidence she provided that said there was no link was faulty. Therefore, she is just asserting that there is no link. Second, her own evidence from Round 4 explicitly notes that there will be an increase in natural disasters. I will post the quote again because she dropped it: 'The consequences of open ended rise in atmospheric CO2 are manifest in the geological record (Frontispiece). The world is in a lag period, when increasing atmospheric energy is expressed by intense hurricanes, increased pressure at mid-latitude high pressure zones and shift of climate zones towards the poles. With ensuing desertification of temperate zones, i.e. southern Europe, southern Australia, southern Africa, the desiccated forests become prey to firestorms, such as in Victoria and California.' Her own evidence that SHE chose to cite says that there will be an increase in firestorms and hurricanes. Therefore, global warming increases natural disasters and thus deaths. The final impact was flooding in coastal cities and the deaths of millions of humans and damages in billions of dollars. After Round 3, she did not even attempt to address this point at all. This point is thus conceded and is a cause for concern. By itself, it notes that global warming is an issue because it can cause millions of deaths by flooding coastal cities that are currently above water and also causing billions of dollars in damages to those cities. Voting IssuesPlease vote pro on the following points: 1. Global warming is man-made. She provided no evidence to support her assertions of a wholly natural cycle after she conceded that her evidence should not have been used. 2. Global warming has disastrous effects. Her own sources tell you that there are a rise in natural disasters and she dropped the analysis about the flooding of coastal cities, plethora of human deaths, and and damages in billions of dollars.</h>

    <t>Thanks for a swift reply. I. WHAT IS A GREENHOUSE GAS? This was an observation as my partner points out. Conceded to both sides.II. THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT  My partner's claim is that CO2 is very minute scale in the atmosphere and it really doesn't effect us that much. However, let's see how much CO2 can hurt us. This graph is from NASA and it shows the relationship between CO2 and climate change: [1]The current level of CO2 is 380 parter per million. So, my partner brought up a good question: IF carbon dioxide makes up only a minute portion of the atmosphere, how can global warming be traced to it? And how can such a tiny amount of change produce such large effects? Pieter Tans from NOAA's Earth system Research Labratory provides this answer: [2]   'The earth's surface absorbs visible radiation from the sun, which causes heating. At the same time the surface and the atmosphere emit infrared radiation back to space, which produces cooling. Our eyes cannot see infrared radiation but we can feel how our skin absorbs it when we are standing next to a hot object without touching it. Over a long period the earth's surface temperature will remain approximately constant because the amount of heat absorbed as visible light is equal to the amount emitted as infrared light. Nitrogen, oxygen and argon together comprise more than 99 percent of the atmosphere. None of these three gases absorb either visible or infrared light; both types penetrate the entire atmosphere. It is as though, when it comes to the absorption and emission of light, the atmosphere's three main components do not exist!' So, what is happening is as the surface of the earth absorbs visible radiation from the sun, it causes heating. Simultaniously, the surface and the atmosphere emit infrared radiation back into space which produces cooling. Although Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Argon together make up 99% of the atmosphere, these gasses do not absorb visible or infrared light thus penetrating the entire atmosphere. Consequently, the greenhosue gasses take their toll. He continues: 'The next most abundant gases--water vapor and carbon dioxide--do absorb a portion of the infrared heat radiated by the earth's surface, thereby preventing it from reaching space. Instead of dissipating into space, the infrared radiation that is absorbed by atmospheric water vapor or carbon dioxide produces heating, which in turn makes the earth's surface warmer. This is known as the greenhouse effect and without it our planet's surface would likely be frozen, like Mars. The heat absorbed by water vapor and carbon dioxide is shared with all the nitrogen, oxygen and argon, because the latter molecules are always bumping into water vapor and carbon dioxide as they mix in the atmosphere. This effect makes the atmosphere act somewhat like a blanket that becomes thicker when amounts of water vapor, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide, increase. The top of the blanket remains cold and continues to emit about the same amount of infrared to space but below the blanket it gets warmer because it is more difficult for the heat to rise to the top. The heating effect of extra carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and many other minor gases can be calculated with confidence based on the absorption properties that have been measured carefully in the laboratory. Currently, the total heating produced by the increases of all long-lived greenhouse gases (excluding water vapor) since preindustrial times is equal to about 1 percent of all solar radiation absorbed at the surface. The effect would be somewhat similar if the sun had started to shine 1 percent more brightly during the 20th century.'  Next, 16kadams claims that human CO2 are too tiny to matter; less than 5%. However, this once more is not entirely accurate. From the graph and from ice cores, we see that CO2 in the atmosphere remained stable between 180-300 ppm for the past 500,000 years [3]. In recent centuries since we started contributing to CO2, it has risen vastly to over 380 ppm. What does all this show? it shows that humans do play an important factor in the contribution to CO2. III. PROOF I cited 3 proofs to show that humans are contributing mainly to global warming: (1) Human finger print on CO2; (2) Nature alone cannot account for the changes that we see; and (3) Lower-level atmosphere — which contains the carbon load—is expanding. 1. CO2 does trap heat, but as mentioned:See above as I have refuted what my partner stated above REFUTATIONS TO CON'S R1lt; Natural cycles Noted above.Problems with the GH theory My partner is correct in saying that water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas; however, CO2 still plays the most important role in greenhouse gas. We do not want to look only at the abundance of the greenhosue gas; but also its influence. The Union of Concerned Scientists notes: [4] 'CO2 has caused most of the warming and its influence is expected to continue. CO2, more than any other climate driver, has contributed the most to climate change between 1750 and 2005.[1, 2, 3] The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued a global climate assessment in 2007 that compared the relative influence exerted by key heat-trapping gases, tiny particles known as aerosols, and land use change of human origin on our climate between 1750 and 2005.[3] By measuring the abundance of heat-trapping gases in ice cores, the atmosphere, and other climate drivers along with models, the IPCC calculated the “radiative forcing” (RF) of each climate driver—in other words, the net increase (or decrease) in the amount of energy reaching Earth’s surface attributable to that climate driver. Positive RF values represent average surface warming and negative values represent average surface cooling. CO2 has the highest positive RF (see Figure 1) of all the human-influenced climate drivers compared by the IPCC. Other gases have more potent heat-trapping ability molecule per molecule than CO2 (e.g. methane), but are simply far less abundant in the atmosphere and being added more slowly.'Here is a graph from the same source to note the climate influence of the different greenhouse gasses.Out of room/time.</t>

    <t>First Round: Acceptance Second Round: Stating the case Third Round: Rebuttle Fourth Round: Rebuttle Fourth Round Concluding arguements</t>
<h>Global warming caused by humans?  In round three of this debate I stated that 'Human additions to total greenhouse gases play a small role, contributing about 0.2% - 0.3% to Earth's greenhouse effect.' The definition of global warming is 'what happens when the temperature of the earth increases. This temperature increase is something that happens naturally, although it is also contributed to by human activity.' So as I've stated in the past. I do believe that human involvement is occurring during this stage of the earth's global climate change, but I think it is a very small amount, and for the most part is a natural process.  Dropping Evidence:  The reason I dropped the scientific evidence from the previous rounds is because the earth has been in the universe for 4.6 billion years. So although both of the previous charts may be true, they do not go back far enough to state if global warming is an issue or not. There will always be natural climate cycles. Nothing can stop that from occurring.  Natural Selection:  I do not justify murder by believing in the theory of natural selection. Natural Selection is the survival of the fittest. By survival of the fittest I mean a natural process resulting in the evolution of organisms best adapted to the environment. Humans might even be able to adapt to the climate changes and live through this climate change. It has been going on for so long and we and many other species are still alive. So, to reiterate, I do not justify murder, I just believe that the most well adapted species will survive.  My source from the previous round:  Humans are only altering the earth slightly, as I've said in previous rounds. Also, most species do alter the earth in either a good way or a bad way. At the time that humans first started to increase their carbon dioxide use, they didn't plan on slightly causing the earth's temperatures to rise.  As I have stated in round 3 of this debate, as of now, there is no proof that global warming causes natural disasters. The word natural means that it exists by nature; not made or caused by humankind. And in this argument, you believe that global warming is man-made. So to state that natural disasters are caused by humans must be false because of the definition of the word NATURAL.  Ice Ages:  I do recognize that Ice Ages are caused by low amounts of CO2. The reason that I had mentioned Ice Ages was to show that the earth has high and low amounts. Another reason I mentioned this was to prove that climate changes are natural and that they occur no matter what and there is nothing that humans can do to stop this from occurring.  Carbon Emission:  In my past arguments I have been able to show that carbon levels rise and fall and I have shown many sources that prove that. The reason they are rising is because cycles always occur and the earth is just taking its natural course, like I have said multiple times!  Impacts:  As I have stated earlier, as the earth changes, species die off. It has happened many times in the past and will happen many times in the future. The species that do become extinct were just not the most fit and could not live through different climate changes.  Conclusion:  I still do not believe that global warming is an issue. Earth will continue to change naturally and there is nothing that humans can do to change this from happening. This type of climate change has been going on for a long period of time. Earth is just trying to balance out all the changes that are occurring in the only way it knows how to.</h>

    <t>FrameworkShe finally drops the analysis that notes that she has already conceded that global warming exists because she argues that there is a natural cycle that involves periods of warming and cooling. Extend this observation cleanly across the flow. The impact is that even if she proves that global warming is natural, and we refuse to accept my evidence that it is man-made, it doesn't matter because we have to then discuss the impacts of global warming in order to determine if it is an issue. Again, this was dropped in the speech she just delivered.Scientific EvidenceShe next tells you that she concedes that 4000 years (her evidence) is not long enough to determine if there is a cycle or not, but neither is 400,000 years. First, she cold drops the analysis I gave about how the cycles last for 100,000 years each, meaning that 400,000 years is enough to note the trends in the modern cycle. Second, this argument is just nonsensical. If we cannot look at either of our evidence, how do we determine if global warming is natural? She is literally telling you that we should drop all scientific evidence and just pretend that it is not an issue. Third, she concedes to the validity of my evidence the moment she argues that there is a cycle. My evidence adequately demonstrates this cycle. How can we determine if there is a cycle or not if we ignore the evidence? Since she agrees that a cycle exists (as evidenced by the fact that she argued this in her previous round), and we only know that a cycle exists because of my scientific evidence, she essentially has conceded to the validity of my evidence.Moreover, I will be accepting one of my opponent' sources because it examines evidence from the past 500,000,000 years and reaches the same conclusion that I did previously [1]. Please refer to the debate below.So, you can extend all of the dropped analysis relating to this evidence. First extend the argument that atmospheric carbon dioxide is increasing at a rate that is exponentially higher than it should be. The levels we are currently experiencing are higher than those that are present due to the cycle. Then extend the evidence that, according to the cycle, we should be in a reduction phase; meaning that we are actually going opposite of the trend. None of this is a result of natural processes; since the Industrial Revolution, we have been adding CO2 to the atmosphere. The impacts of all of this is that global warming is indeed an artificial phenomenon.Natural SelectionShe's completely misunderstanding the point. I never said that natural selection involves murder; I said that she is using Natural Selection to justify murder. Her argument is that organisms who were 'meant to survive' will survive, so altering the Earth's climate is ok. My analysis notes that we have no right to artificially alter the Earth's climate because the organisms that are currently alive have a right to life; we cannot justify their slaughter by claiming that they were meant to die. Moreover, a great chunk of the organisms killed will be human, and in society we recognize that other humans have rights.I would like to extend the source that she provided in this section of the debate because it provides a plethora of evidence for my side. [1] Let us examine this evidence from the source that she provided and agrees with.The first thing that it tells you is that the only other time that Earth has ever had such high CO2 levels in the atmosphere was during periods that resulted from artificial rises due to asteroid collisions [1]. That means that the source is telling you that CO2 levels get to this level only through artificial means. 'Raising atmospheric CO2 level at a rate of 2ppm/year, a pace unprecedented in the geological record, with the exception of the effects of CO2 released from craters excavated by large asteroid impacts, the deleterious effects of pollution and deforestation have reached a geological dimension, tracking towards conditions which existed on Earth in the mid-Pliocene, about 2.8 million years ago.' [1] Note that the source even tells you that the increases in atmospheric CO2 are a result of pollution and deforestation, which are activities that are done by humans.The second thing that it does is provide more evidence for my contention about ocean levels rising and ocean acidification.' According to her source,'When the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere rises above a critical threshold, climate shifts to a different state. Any significant increase in the level of carbon gases triggers powerful feedbacks. These include ice melt/warm water interaction, decline of ice reflection (albedo) and increase in infrared absorption by exposed water. Further release of CO2 from the oceans and from drying and burning vegetation shifts global climate zones towards the poles, warms the oceans and induces ocean acidification.' [1] This provides more evidence for a later portion of the debate.The third thing that her source tells you is that natural disasters, like firestorms, will result from global warming. [1]. 'The consequences of open ended rise in atmospheric CO2 are manifest in the geological record (Frontispiece). The world is in a lag period, when increasing atmospheric energy is expressed by intense hurricanes, increased pressure at mid-latitude high pressure zones and shift of climate zones towards the poles. With ensuing desertification of temperate zones, i.e. southern Europe, southern Australia, southern Africa, the desiccated forests become prey to firestorms, such as in Victoria and California.'All of this is directly from the source that my opponent posted. She accepts this source as true, so please extend the evidence from it.Ice AgesI was not asking for evidence that five Ice Ages occur; I was asking for evidence that they were a result of CO2 increases. She drops all of the evidence that I provided that demonstrates that they were a result of decreased CO2 in the atmosphere. Extend that cleanly across the flow.Carbon EmissionsShe insists that the carbon fluctuations are natural, but she has not provided any alternative mechanism that explains why 1. Carbon Dioxide levels are increasing at an unprecedented rate and 2. Why they are increasing at all, since the cycle demonstrates that they should currently be decreasing. Moreover, her own sources tell you that atmospheric carbon dioxide is increasing at unprecedented rates due to pollution and and deforestation, artificial phenomena, and it examines evidence from the past 500 million years [1]. At this point there is no reason to conclude that current global warming trends are natural.ImpactsExtend the first impact, namely that 30% of all plant and animal species will perish as a result of global warming, because she has dropped this argument entirely in the past two rounds. Extend the other argument about global disasters because she dropped the argument in this round when I asked her to provide evidence from the actual study instead of conservative blogs. Both of these are deleterious impacts of global warming that can cost millions of lives.She decides to address the argument about ocean levels rising and flooding coastal cities. First, this is pretty unfair, considering that she dropped the argument previously, but I will debunk her response anyways. Her response is that people will live in dangerous flood areas, so their homes will be underwater for other reasons. This is entirely nonresponsive to the argument, which notes that coastal cities that are currently not underwater will be underwater in the future due to increases in ocean levels (something that her own source agrees with) that result from global warming. Areas that are currently not flood areas will soon be converted into flood areas.</t>
<h>    FrameworkShe finally drops the analysis that notes that she has already conceded that global warming exists because she argues that there is a natural cycle that involves periods of warming and cooling.</h>

    <t>Response to Opponent's CaseThe first thing that she tells you is that she believes in global climate change. She notes that throughout history, there have been significant climate changes.This is extremely important. The moment that she concedes that global climate changes exist in a cycle, she concedes that global warming exists. Even if it is just part of a cycle, she still agrees that global warming is something that can and does affect the Earth. This has an important impact in this round. Even if I lose the argument aboutwhether or not humans are responsible for global warming, she has still conceded that global warming exists so we must consider all of its impacts in order to determine whether or not it is an issue. The second thing that she tells you is that scientists who believe in global warming are not “looking at the big picture”. This is absolutely and undeniably false. I posted analysis about how, based on trends in climate change from the past 400,000 years, not only have our carbon levels been expontentially increasing at a rate that is higher than the rate that should result from the cycle, but that current trends are also defying the cycle, because carbon levels in the atmosphere should currently be decreasing. In fact, when she tells you to look at the “overall picture”, she is not even analyzing trends from the past 400,000 years; her analysis only extends back 4,000 years, which is not even enough time to complete a single cycle. This argument should thus not be considered. She next argues that disasters are fine because by natural selection, species will adapt to changes in climate. This may be true, but it denies humans who are currently living their right to life. Using natural selection as a justification for permitting policies means that we should also permit murder, theft, etc. because the most fit individuals will survive. Obviously, however, we do not because we believe that all humans have inalienable rights, so we should not be wilfully demolishing the environment and killing countless humans just to promote survival of the fittest. Defense of CaseShe first notes that she never said that global warming exists. That is absolutely false. The moment she conceded that cycles of global climate change exist, she concedes that global warming occurs naturally. Cycles have upwards and downwards trends; if temperature decreases, it also has to increase. “Also, in the chart above, 400,000 years is not enough proof to show that this is not natural because the pattern itself has been occurring for far longer. The earth has been around for about 4.6 billion years.”This argument is completely false and hypocritical. It is false because the cycles occur every 100,000 years, so we can easily examine how the climate changes by examining the past 400,000 years. Moreover, it is incredibly hypocritical because her analysis only extends for 4000 years. If my analysis, which examines a period of time 100 times longer than her analysis, should not be considered, we should not even spend half of a neuron considering thinking about looking at her analysis. At this point in time, my analysis is better than her analysis because the data that I am examining belongs to a greater set than the data she is examining. My data is therefore more objective and more likely to reveal the truth than her data is. “There have been five Ice Ages in the Earth's past. These Ice Ages occurred because of high carbon emission.”This is not even close to true (note that my opponent never provided a source). Ice Ages are caused by reductions in atmospheric carbon dioxide and not because of high carbon dioxide emissions. “Maureen Raymo,William Ruddiman and others propose that theTibetan andColorado Plateaus are immense CO2 'scrubbers' with a capacity to remove enough CO2 from the global atmosphere to be a significant causal factor of the 40 million yearCenozoic Cooling trend. They further claim that approximately half of their uplift (and CO2 'scrubbing' capacity) occurred in the past 10 million years.” [1] “There is evidence thatgreenhouse gas levels fell at the start of ice ages and rose during the retreat of the ice sheets . . . TheSnowball Earth hypothesis maintains that the severe freezing in the lateProterozoic was ended by an increase in CO2 levels in the atmosphere, and some supporters of Snowball Earth argue that it was caused by a reduction in atmospheric CO2.” [1] This fits the trends that I have argued in my previous analysis, namely that increases in CO2 cause temperature increases, and decreases in CO2 cause temperature decreases. “So, to say that carbon levels rising are not natural is a false statement.”This is a strawman logical fallacy. I never said that increases in carbon levels are not natural; I said that the manner in which they are currently increasing is not natural because they are exponentially increasing to levels higher than those that results from the cycle and they are increasing at rates that should not be occurring if we are examining the cycle. The cycle predicts a decrease in CO2 emissions at this point in history. My opponent has offered no alternative explanation as to why we are currently defying the cycle and why CO2 levels are increasing to such high levels. The cycle predicts carbon dioxide levels at about 285 ppm for the peak year 1850. The current concentration is 385 ppm. Impacts of Global WarmingShe drops all of the analysis about the following impacts: the disruption of biological systems and the massive damage to humanity as a result of increases in ocean levels. The evidence I provided for the disruption of biological systems noted that global warming will be responsible for the destruction of 30% of the current flora and fauna. The evidence I provided for the massive damages to humanity demonstrated that several cities would be left underwater, causing millions of deaths and trillions of dollars in economic damages. These were cold dropped, so extend them cleanly across the flow. Unless she wants to argue that destruction of 30% of the species on Earth and the deaths of millions of humans and trillions of dollars worth of damage in economic costs are all good, this is a sufficient reason to vote for me. She does, however, attack the analysis I provided about Natural Disasters. She first claims that my source is based on a false UN Report. First, my argument was not from a UN report. The source I used mentioned the UN report in reference to a different argument that I did not use in this round; my evidence was based on a different study. Second, I did a quick Google search using the quote “We find insufficient evidence to claim a statistical relationship between global temperature increase and catastrophic losses” and only found links to conservative blogs claiming that the report said that. Such a devastating report surely should be easy to find, so I challenge my opponent to find the original report, not a bunch of conservative blogs that claim that the report said it, and paste the link here.Third, my argument is based on the rise of heat waves. Heat waves are known to cause natural disasters like tornadoes and hurricanes </t>

    <t>I am going to try something that I have not done for a year. Instead of doing a specific line-by-line, I will be using this round to crystallize my position because I do not think that my opponent really made a substantive effort to attack my position in this round. That does mean that I am dropping anything; I will cover the flow as I tell the “story of the round”. Before I begin, however, I would like to address this argument that my opponent makes about 0.2% of the greenhouse effect being due to humans. I have no idea where she got this from; she did not source this statistic, so I cannot explain why the methodology of the statistic was wrong. Moreover, some of her other sources contradict this argument and statistic, so there is no reason to accept it. CyclesThis round rests on whether or not global warming has an impact. As my observation noted, as long as my opponent believes that there is any type of climate change, global warming necessarily has to exist. This means that even if my opponent has convinced you that global warming is entirely a natural process, she does not win this debate. She needs to demonstrate that the impacts of that process are meaningless, so any discussion of whether or not it is artificial is tangential to the real debate. This observation has been dropped since Round 3. My opponent has maintained throughout this round that any climate change is a result of a cycle.This means that she concedes that global warming does exist in some form. I also agree that cycles exist. I provided evidence in Round 1 that demonstrate that there are cycles every 100,000 years in which carbon levels peak at 285 ppm. According to my evidence, we reached this peak in 1850. That means, according to the cycles, we should not only have reduced carbon levels at the moment, but that we should also be witnessing a reduction in temperature and a reduction in carbon levels. The evidence that I cited notes that our carbon levels are currently increasing at an exponentially high rate and are going against the trends established by the cycle. My opponent then proceeded to not only reject my evidence based on time period, but to also concede that her own evidence did not examine the Earth’s history properly. She completely dropped the argument that I made, however, about how since the cycles last 100,000 years, my evidence, which extends back 600,000 years, is enough to see the trends. Moreover, if she is rejecting her own evidence, she has no basis for for making the claim that global climate change is natural because she has nothing to back up her arguments. She already conceded that her evidence is false, and she did not provide any more evidence to support her assertions. This itself is a reason to accept my evidence because she has not provided any sort of alternative studies that she considers to be more accurate. Ergo, she cannot make her unsupported assertions.While discussing another argument, opponent did provide us with evidence that examines that past 500 million years. Happily, that evidence supports my position. It explicitly notes, “Raising atmospheric CO2 level at a rate of 2ppm/year, a pace unprecedented in the geological record, with the exception of the effects of CO2 released from craters excavated by large asteroid impacts, the deleterious effects of pollution and deforestation have reached a geological dimension, tracking towards conditions which existed on Earth in the mid-Pliocene, about 2.8 million years ago.' Her own evidence is literally telling you that the only time that we have had such rapid increases in CO2 levels was when massive asteroids collided with Earth. Ergo, by her own evidence, which examines the past 500 million years, these levels are only reached artificially, and are not a natural part of the cycle. This was entirely dropped by my opponent. That should be enough to tell you that the global warming we are experiencing is an artificial phenomenon. ImpactsI discussed three impacts of global warming that demonstrate that it is, in fact, an issue. The first impact was that there will be a 30% decrease in the flora and fauna species of this planet. Her only response to this was natural selection allows for the best adapted species to survive. She still has not responded to the rights analysis that I posted in Round 1. Even if the beings who are most fit to survive will survive, that does not mean that we are justified in committing acts that will cause the destruction of 30% of Earth’s species because they have a right to survive. Natural adaptation and competition is one thing, but specifically causing harms to those species is another. It’s the difference between chopping someone’s leg off and seeing someone being born with a birth defect. One is natural and is not our fault. The other is something that we are doing actively and is a violation of rights. The second impact was the increase in natural disasters due to an increase in heat waves. She continuously asserts that global warming does not cause natural disasters. First, I would like to point out that in Round 4, she conceded that the evidence she provided that said there was no link was faulty. Therefore, she is just asserting that there is no link. Second, her own evidence from Round 4 explicitly notes that there will be an increase in natural disasters. I will post the quote again because she dropped it: 'The consequences of open ended rise in atmospheric CO2 are manifest in the geological record (Frontispiece). The world is in a lag period, when increasing atmospheric energy is expressed by intense hurricanes, increased pressure at mid-latitude high pressure zones and shift of climate zones towards the poles. With ensuing desertification of temperate zones, i.e. southern Europe, southern Australia, southern Africa, the desiccated forests become prey to firestorms, such as in Victoria and California.' Her own evidence that SHE chose to cite says that there will be an increase in firestorms and hurricanes. Therefore, global warming increases natural disasters and thus deaths. The final impact was flooding in coastal cities and the deaths of millions of humans and damages in billions of dollars. After Round 3, she did not even attempt to address this point at all. This point is thus conceded and is a cause for concern. By itself, it notes that global warming is an issue because it can cause millions of deaths by flooding coastal cities that are currently above water and also causing billions of dollars in damages to those cities. Voting IssuesPlease vote pro on the following points: 1. Global warming is man-made. She provided no evidence to support her assertions of a wholly natural cycle after she conceded that her evidence should not have been used. 2. Global warming has disastrous effects. Her own sources tell you that there are a rise in natural disasters and she dropped the analysis about the flooding of coastal cities, plethora of human deaths, and and damages in billions of dollars.</t>

    <t>As per my opponent's outline, I will only be presenting case arguments in this round. Rebuttals were specifically reserved for the next round by my opponent in Round 1. CaseMy case will be twofold. First, I will demonstrate that Global Warming does, in fact, exist even though it should not be happening. Second, I will demonstrate that Global Warming will adversely affect the human species. ObservationEven if global warming is a natural phenomenon, it still exists, so you can extend the portion of my analysis in which she concedes that there is a current global trend for increased surface temperatures. My burden in this debate, therefore, is to demonstrate that this increase in surface temperatures is, in fact, an issue, so as long as I prove that the increased temperatures that my opponent concedes occur are disastrous, you vote Pro. However, I will also be presenting evidence that global warming is a result of human activities. This is not necessary for me to win the round because she concedes that there are worldwide increases in surface temperature, but I shall do so anyways. Global Warming ExistsGlobal temperatures are, for the most part, depend on the levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere [1]. Greenhouse gases are gases that absorb and emit radiation within the thermal infrared range and that are responsible fore the greenhouse effect [2]. The Greenhouse Effect is a a process by which thermal radiation from a planetary surface is absorbed by atmospheric greenhouse gases, and is re-radiated in all directions. [3] Through the Greenhouse Effect, heat from the sun is trapped by the greenhouse gases and projected down to the Earth. This results in increased surface temperatures [3].  Since carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and increased levels of greenhouse gases result in increases in surface temperatures of the Earth's surface, increased carbon dioxide levels cause increases in global surface temperatures.    My opponent is correct when she argues that there are natural cycles for global climate change. The fundamental problem with er analysis is that the current trend is not following the natural cycle. Analysis of the current levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere indicates that the levels are higher than those that were seen for at least the last 400,000 years of Earth's history. Moreover, whereas the carbon dioxide levels in Earth's atmosphere generally increases gradually, the levels in our atmosphere have been increasing at exponentially frightening rates.     As the above graph adequately demonstrates, the current carbon level vastly exceed the levels that would result from the cycle. In fact, based on the chart, the cycle levels peaked at the year 1850, meaning that if this were a result of the cycle, we currently should be experiencing a decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and thus lower global temperatures. In fact, not only is this not following the trend, but it is defying it entirely. This is a direct result of human activities and the Industrial Revolution. Using the carbon dioxide trapped in ice-caps, scientists can determine the atmosheric concentrations of specific gases at the time at which the ice was formed. Pre-industrial revolution carbon dioxide levels were about 285 ppm [1]. The current concentration is 385 ppm [1]. This is unnatural, as evidenced by the fact that in the last 650,000 years (the ice cap does not go beyond this age), the carbon dioxide concentration during warm periods has varied between 180 ppm and 300 ppm [1]. It has never exceeded 300 ppm until now, a time at which we should be experiencing a global reduction in carbon dioxide levels. Ergo, the increase in carbon dioxide levels is unnatural and was caused by humans. Global Warming is DisastrousIn reality, whether or not global warming is man-made or natural is immaterial to this round because my opponent has already conceded that we are currently in an age of surface temperature increases. This means that we should be focusing on the impacts of global warming. As long as I demonstrate that the impacts of global warming are disastrous, I win the round regardless of whether or not it is natural because it then becomes an issue. Projected effects: First, increases in temperature are likely to cause more disruptions in biological systems [4]. This threatens the extinction of many endangered species [4]. In fact, it is projected that after the year 2050, climate change will be the primary driving force behind the loss of global biodiversity. [4]. In fact, studies indicate that approximately 30% of all plant and animal species would face extinction if the global temperature rises to about 4 degrees above the pre-industrial levels [4]. Second, natural disasters are projected to increase as a result of global temperature increases. Scientists have noted that extreme weather is linked to heat waves, which would increase as a result of global warming. Thus, scientists contend, there is likely to be an increase in droughts, tropical cyclone activities, and tsunamis. [4]. All of these are horrendous natural disasters that have massive costs in terms of human life. Third, changes to the ocean would cause massive damages to both humanity and to other life forms. The ocean currently serves as a 'sink for carbon dioxide, meaning that it takes up CO2 that otherwise would have remained in the atmosphere [4]. Increased CO2 levels would cause an increase in ocean intake of CO2 and would thus result in acidification of the oceans. [4]. This would adversely affect many species because a delicate pH must be maintained in order for most species to survive. Moreover, not only does global warming result in ocean acidication, but it also would cause sea-levels to rise for two reasons. First, thermal expansion would lead to the expansion of water and thus a rise in ocean levels. Second, global warming results in rises in ocean levels due to the melting of ice caps [4]. Rises in ocean levels would cause coastal flooding. By the year 2030, several major cities across the globe will be underwater as a result of ocean level changes. [5] This would cause millions of human deaths as well as cost hundreds of billions of dollars in damage. Thus, global warming is man-made and is an issue because it is disastrous. </t>

    <t>Global warming caused by humans?  In round three of this debate I stated that 'Human additions to total greenhouse gases play a small role, contributing about 0.2% - 0.3% to Earth's greenhouse effect.' The definition of global warming is 'what happens when the temperature of the earth increases. This temperature increase is something that happens naturally, although it is also contributed to by human activity.' So as I've stated in the past. I do believe that human involvement is occurring during this stage of the earth's global climate change, but I think it is a very small amount, and for the most part is a natural process.  Dropping Evidence:  The reason I dropped the scientific evidence from the previous rounds is because the earth has been in the universe for 4.6 billion years. So although both of the previous charts may be true, they do not go back far enough to state if global warming is an issue or not. There will always be natural climate cycles. Nothing can stop that from occurring.  Natural Selection:  I do not justify murder by believing in the theory of natural selection. Natural Selection is the survival of the fittest. By survival of the fittest I mean a natural process resulting in the evolution of organisms best adapted to the environment. Humans might even be able to adapt to the climate changes and live through this climate change. It has been going on for so long and we and many other species are still alive. So, to reiterate, I do not justify murder, I just believe that the most well adapted species will survive.  My source from the previous round:  Humans are only altering the earth slightly, as I've said in previous rounds. Also, most species do alter the earth in either a good way or a bad way. At the time that humans first started to increase their carbon dioxide use, they didn't plan on slightly causing the earth's temperatures to rise.  As I have stated in round 3 of this debate, as of now, there is no proof that global warming causes natural disasters. The word natural means that it exists by nature; not made or caused by humankind. And in this argument, you believe that global warming is man-made. So to state that natural disasters are caused by humans must be false because of the definition of the word NATURAL.  Ice Ages:  I do recognize that Ice Ages are caused by low amounts of CO2. The reason that I had mentioned Ice Ages was to show that the earth has high and low amounts. Another reason I mentioned this was to prove that climate changes are natural and that they occur no matter what and there is nothing that humans can do to stop this from occurring.  Carbon Emission:  In my past arguments I have been able to show that carbon levels rise and fall and I have shown many sources that prove that. The reason they are rising is because cycles always occur and the earth is just taking its natural course, like I have said multiple times!  Impacts:  As I have stated earlier, as the earth changes, species die off. It has happened many times in the past and will happen many times in the future. The species that do become extinct were just not the most fit and could not live through different climate changes.  Conclusion:  I still do not believe that global warming is an issue. Earth will continue to change naturally and there is nothing that humans can do to change this from happening. This type of climate change has been going on for a long period of time. Earth is just trying to balance out all the changes that are occurring in the only way it knows how to.</t>

    <t>First I would like to point out that I never said global warming was not happening. I simply stated that I do not believe that it is an issue, or at least not a main issue. I do however believe that there are climate changes happening all around the world. So I will not try to argue with the first half of your argument.  Natural Cycles:  To a certain extent, the chart shown above does, in fact, follow a natural cycle. In any case, even though there is a significant spike today, the cycle is still natural. The greenhouse effect is what causes the cycle. The spike is just noting our involvement in the greenhouse effect (through our increase use of carbon). The spike is not signifying that global warming is occurring, it is just noting that there is an increase in the cycle.  Also, in the chart above, 400,000 years is not enough proof to show that this is not natural because the pattern itself has been occurring for far longer. The earth has been around for about 4.6 billion years. Temperature Increase: The increase in temperature is nature's way of eliminating the species that would not be able to survive in the long run. Similar drastic temperature changes happened before both of Earth's previous Ice Ages. There have been five Ice Ages in the Earth's past. These Ice Ages occurred because of high carbon emission. During the first few Ice Ages, men were not even alive. So, to say that carbon levels rising are not natural is a false statement. This pattern is inevitable and therefore not an issue, since there is nothing we can do to prevent it.  Global Warming Doesn't Cause Natural Disasters:  There is no evidence that global warming causes natural disasters. You used a source that spoke about the UN IPCC AR4. Well, in one of my sources it states that, 'The UN IPCC AR4 claim was based upon an unpublished report by Robert Muir-Wood, which was published later in 2008 with the new caveat that: 'We find insufficient evidence to claim a statistical relationship between global temperature increase and catastrophic losses.'' (Anderson) Global losses from natural disasters have been going up about 8% per year. But since there are more people and more building in risky areas occurring, there is no proof about global warming causing natural disasters.  Human Involvement:  The Greenhouse Effect is a natural process, one that, though we do play a slight role in it, we are not entirely the cause of. Human additions to total greenhouse gases play a small role, contributing about 0.2% - 0.3% to Earth's greenhouse effect.  'Global warming started long before the 'Industrial Revolution' and the invention of the internal combustion engine. Global warming began 18,000 years ago as the earth started warming its way out of the Pleistocene Ice Age' (A Chilling Perspective). The Earth's climate has been constantly fluctuating. As of now, we are currently at a reprieve from the deep freeze.  Thus, Global Warming is not man-made and is not an issue.</t>

    <t>My chart:  Yes I do recognize that my chart only goes back 4,000 years. I still do believe that you stating that at 400,000 years are enough information to say that global warming is an issue, is not true.  Natural Selection:  I do not by any means necessary believe that murdering another person is a part of natural selection. The meaning of natural selection is the gradual, non-random, process by which biological traits become either more or less common in a population as a function of differential reproduction of their bearers. Natural selection does not have anything to do with murder, just about a person or animal biological features are able to keep them alive or not. Meaning, that if this global climate change is occurring, the animals that are meant to make it through this period, will be able to. In this chart, it goes back 500 million years. This chart shows past Carbon Dioxide levels and past extinctions. This just proves my point that too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has killed certain species and some have still been able to live through it because of their biological make up.  Ice Ages:  I did not realize that I forgot to provide a source for the amount of ice ages that have occurred. But in this website: , it states that there have been 5 ice ages.  Carbon Dioxide Emissions:  'Changes in past atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations can be determined by measuring the composition of air trapped in ice cores from Antarctica.' This quote states there must be changes in the earth's carbon emission for something bad to occur. I do realize that I did attain false information and I do apologize for that. But there still have been high levels of carbon dioxide in the past. So, I still do believe that carbon levels do fluctuates and this is natural. Like Isaac Newton, I do believe that what goes up must come down. I do realize that he was referring to gravity, but I think it applies for this case too, because carbon dioxide does fluctuate though out history. I have said this multiple times and I still do believe that this is the case.  Several cities being under water:  There are multiple reasons that cities will go under water, not only because of global warming. As I stated in the previous argument, people build in dangerous flood areas and they forget to mention that the do this.</t>

    <t>First, I would like to start off by saying that I do believe that there is a global climate change. Here are the reasons I do not believe global warming is an issue. My first reason I believe that global warming is not an issue is that, all throughout history, there have been significant climate changes. This chart is an example of the different climate changes throughout history. With all those climate changes, people were able to work though it and still survive.  Secondly, many people who are already worried about global warming are misinterpreting the information from the scientists. The people who do this are looking for evidence of global warming instead of looking at the evidence objectively and trying to figure out what it truly means. What I mean by this is people are just looking for reasons to say that global warming is true. But what people should be doing is looking at the big picture and seeing if this has happened in the past and figuring out ways to work through the climate change just like others did during the medieval warm period.  Thirdly, weather always fluctuates. Plants and animals are able to adjust to the climate changes that occurred in the past, so they should be able to do it after this change in weather. Charles Darwin came up with a theory called Survival of the Fittest. This theory states that 'species adapt and change by natural selection with the best suited mutations becoming dominant.' Darwin realized that over time, climates do change and so does the world. So, as the world changes, life adapts to the new environment.</t>

<h>Global warming has been a growing problem over the decade, and with our destruction of forests, use of factories and pollution has undoubtedly contributed to it. As my opponent has stated, it will be his burden to prove that there are other priorities other than the environment, and my burden will be to prove that environment should be the priority over these other issues. I would like to define the following: World environment issues: the current hole we have in the ozone layer, amount of carbon dioxide we are releasing, pollution we are causing, cutting down trees, harming the land by mining... and so forth. Also, this not only contains the actions that are ruining the Earth, but also the ones that happen accidentally, such as oil spills. Priority: issue that is considered first over others Contention 1, Even the current actions aren't doing much to save the environment The Kyoto Protocol, foundations of renewable resources, and many actions have been taken to slow down the Global Warming. However, what good has it done? Sure it reduced the amount of Carbon dioxide we produce, but it still has been rising over the years continuously. See in the example of China. (I couldn't copy the chart on here so you'll have to go on the site to look at it) [1] In 2009, the total amount of carbon dioxide emission was 31,629,955 and in 2010, it was 33,508,901. [2] Contention 2, The world is not safe with these issues unsolved Sub point A. oil spills From the spill in the Gulf of Mexico, we briefly know how dangerous a spill can be. I will show you how exactly it will be harmful to us. Firstly, the fish and the birds die. Birds die from oil spills if their feathers are covered in oil. The bird will then be poisoned because it will try to clean itself. Animals may die because they get hypothermia, causing their body temperature to be really low. They may die from really low body temperature. Oil may also cause the death of an animal by entering the animal's lungs or liver. The animal will then be poisoned by the oil. Oil also can kill an animal by blinding it. The animal will not be able to see and be aware of their predators. If they are not aware of other animals, they may be eaten.[3] Secondly, humans are affected. The cleanup workers exposed to crude oil often suffer acute effects — stinging eyes, rashes, nausea, dizziness, headaches, coughs and other respiratory symptoms. Exposure to oil did induce DNA damage that was greater in those with more exposure. DNA damage can be the first step along the path to cancer.[4] Lastly, even if the companies manage to clean all of the oil, they can't do it perfectly, and some of the traces will still be left in the ocean. This will continue to kill the sea life and marine birds, and suppose that people ate that fish. The people will be poisoned and even if people don't eat this fish, there will be less fish for the fishers to catch. Spills may take weeks, months or even years to clean up.[5] So if an issue like this come up, the government will have to make this a priority because it can take a long time to clean up, and if it is left alone, then it will harm animals and people. Sub point B. decimation of forests. Decimation of forests will soon lead to too much trees being cut down, and we won't have enough trees to use, and the air to be filtered. Air is the necessity of life, but if we cut down too much trees, someday in the future, we won't have enough air for the entire population of the world.  Deforestation affects the amount of water in the soil and groundwater and the moisture in the atmosphere. Forests support considerable biodiversity, providing valuable habitat for wildlife; moreover, forests foster medicinal conservation and the recharge of aquifers.  With forest biotopes being a major, irreplaceable source of new drugs (like taxol), deforestation can destroy genetic variations (such as crop resistance) irretrievably.  Shrinking forest cover lessens the landscape's capacity to intercept, retain and transport precipitation. Instead of trapping precipitation, which then percolates to groundwater systems, deforested areas become sources of surface water runoff, which moves much faster than subsurface flows. That quicker transport of surface water can translate into flash flooding and more localized floods than would occur with the forest cover.  Deforestation also contributes to decreased evapotranspiration, which lessens atmospheric moisture which in some cases affects precipitation levels downwind from the deforested area, as water is not recycled to downwind forests, but is lost in runoff and returns directly to the oceans.  According to one preliminary study, in deforested north and northwest China, the average annual precipitation decreased by one third between the 1950s and the 1980s.  Long-term gains can be obtained by managing forest lands sustainable to maintain both forest cover and provide a biodegradable renewable resource.  Forests are also important stores of organic carbon, and forests can extract carbon dioxide and pollutants from the air, thus contributing to biosphere stability and probably relevant to the greenhouse effect. Forests are also valued for their aesthetic beauty and as a cultural resource and tourist attraction.  Sub point C. the overall unstable environment of the world The upper safety limit for atmospheric CO2 is 350 parts per million (ppm). Atmospheric CO2 levels have stayed higher than 350 ppm since early 1988. [6] According to this, our world is not safe enough for us to rely on the atmosphere. Eventually, something really bad will happen because we just keep continuously emitting carbon dioxide, we'll reach a point where the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is too high. Sub point D. the results of all these issues Scientists warned that as the hole closes up in the next few decades, temperatures on the continent could rise by around 3C on average, with melting ice contributing to a global sea-level increases of up to 1.4m.[7] This is only if the hole in the ozone layer stayed that way. But with the rate we are polluting the Earth, it is not going to stay that big, but it is going to get bigger. If we then try to wait for it to fix itself, the warming of Antarctica is going to continue, and in the end, we'll have oceans so high, that most coastal cities will be underwater. A new Ice Age could come from all this. If enough cold, fresh water coming from the melting polar ice caps and the melting glaciers of Greenland flows into the northern Atlantic, it will shut down the Gulf Stream, which keeps Europe and northeastern North America warm. The worst-case scenario would be a full-blown return of the last ice age - in a period as short as 2 to 3 years from its onset - and the mid-case scenario would be a period like the 'little ice age' of a few centuries ago that disrupted worldwide weather patterns leading to extremely harsh winters, droughts, worldwide desertification, crop failures, and wars around the world.</h>

    <t>Hello what about the evidence</t>
<h>The pro is arguing that the most important issue currently facing the world is related to its environment. I will be giving several examples of important world issues. If I can prove that at least one of these examples is more important than the world environment I have fulfilled my burden of proof, and therefore I should win.  We are humans, therefore the survival of humans and the minimization of human suffering should be our highest priority. The importance of an issue in this debate should be determined by the potential consequences of ignoring the issue. If the consequences of issue X are more severe than issue Y, then issue X becomes the top priority by default. My CaseIssue 1: Maintaining and Improving International Relations. Planet Earth has come a long way in the past couple thousand years. The most notable advancement humans have made is in technology. As of now, Syria, North Korea, and Iran are all in possession of nuclear weapons[1]. Three very unstable nations possessing nuclear weapons which are obviously capable of immense destructive power. If a Nuclear War was ever to occur, the loss of human life would be absolutely devastating. It is estimated that after a nuclear war, more than half of the world’s population would be wiped out[2]. Nuclear war has the greatest potential for severe consequences, therefore avoidance should be our highest priority. Issue 2: The Water Crisis. Currently, 3.5 million people die each year from water-related disease. 84% of the people who die are children between the ages of 0-14[3]. Obviously this is a significant loss of human life. Especially over such a trivial matter such as the availability of water and the sanitation of said water. This is a higher priority over the global environment because this crisis is occurring right this second. The pro’s issue of the global environment is not causing such a significant amount of death as with this crisis. Issue 3: Global OverpopulationDue to advancements in modern medicine, decreased mortality rates, and increased fertility rates; the human population is growing exponentially. This exponential growth will eventually lead to earth reaching its carrying capacity for human beings. What this means is that we will one day reach a point where the Earth will not longer be able to sustain the human population with its resources. This will result in mass starvation and chaos. The average scientific estimate for Earth’s carrying capacity is between 10-15 billion people[4]. Human beings will likely reach 9 billion people by 2050[5]. This is a serious and imminent danger. It may not directly affect us within our lifetime but we have an obligation to prevent human overpopulation because of the amount of suffering and death it would inevitably cause if left to continue.Pro Case Contention 1: Even the current actions aren't doing much to save the environmentI’m not going to dispute the fact that CO2 emissions have been rising, but what are the potential consequences of this? What makes this important enough that it should be the highest priority? The pro needs to make an argument instead of just listing facts.Contention 2: The world is not safe with these issues unsolvedSub point A. oil spillsThe first half of this sub-point touches on the deaths that will be caused to animals. The priority here is human life so unless this disaster could drastically affect human life then it should definitely not be the highest priority. As for the human suffering associated with cleaning up the oil spills, I have to ask how? Do they not wear protective gear when cleaning up a biohazard? Regardless, pro has only stated that it would essentially just cause pain/irritation and MAYBE in some cases cause cancer. The issues I will address in my case supercede this point because the potential consequences are much more deadly to the human populace. Sub point B. decimation of forests.'Decimation of forests will soon lead to too much trees being cut down, and we won't have enough trees to use, and the air to be filtered. Air is the necessity of life, but if we cut down too much trees, someday in the future, we won't have enough air for the entire population of the world.'I would really like to see a source to verify your claim that someday we won’t have enough air. Until I see evidence this is just a bare assertion and can be dismissed as such. As for the rest of the contention, flash flooding is a very minor issue compared to the ones I have addressed in my own case. Once again, I must ask, what are the potential consequences of ignoring the issue? Pro once again merely has a lengthy list of scientific information and no argumentation. What makes this issue so important that it must be the highest priority? Sub point C. the overall unstable environment of the world'The upper safety limit for atmospheric CO2 is 350 parts per million (ppm). Atmospheric CO2 levels have stayed higher than 350 ppm since early 1988. [6] According to this, our world is not safe enough for us to rely on the atmosphere. Eventually, something really bad will happen because we just keep continuously emitting carbon dioxide, we'll reach a point where the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is too high.'Eventually, something really bad will happen...Like what? What will happen when we reach this point where the CO2 is too high? Sub point D. the results of all these issuesPro never really addresses the results of ALL the issues listed above. They merely discuss the coming of a second ice age. I’m assuming this is related to the high CO2 emissions mentioned early, but I am not certain. While I must admit that the global environment is an important issue, it is not the most important. It is simply not the highest on our list of priorities.  So with that, I eagerly await my opponent's response!</h>

<h>Yay, I managed to get this short enough at last!I thank con for getting this going. In doing this debate, I follow in the great tradition of New Zealand's former prime minister David Lange. In 1985 at Oxford Union, in a debate so intense even the US president tuned in, he fought against Jerry Falwell, a noted friend of then-US-president Ronald Regan, arguing against the motion 'nuclear weapons are morally indefensible'. Lange became the first person in decades to recieve a standing ovation from both sides of the house [1]. Today I am arguing against nuclear energy. Not just big civilian nuclear power plants. Not just nuclear weapons. Not just nuclear clocks or submarines. I argue that the use of nuclear power in all its forms is morally indefensible.After Lange's awesome speech, New Zealand abolished nuclear weapons. Despite claims by the US that we'd need nuclear power plants, nuclear submarines patrolling our shores, and so on and so forth, we have remained nuclear free to this day [2]. And guess what? We're not facing an energy crisis. Our national defense is far less at risk than that of every single nuclear country. And our people have never regretted the decision.Recently, Germany, a major nuclear nation, said they will move toward doing the same as New Zealand by 2022. So far progress has been good, indicating that it is not beyond the realm of possibility for other large nations to follow our lead.Today, I argue that such a model would be beneficial to the whole world, for one simple moral reason. Every nuclear device, when it generates energy, generates waste that we cannot safely dispose of. Take, for instance, the United States in America. The very latest in nuclear technology. The wisest of scientists and engineers. And yet even they dispose of most of their waste by throwing it to the bottom of swimming pools. Incredulously, some people at the NAS actually bothered to examine whether this was dangerous or not, and their results were exactly as you would expect [3]. Some waste is thrown to the bottom of 'sealed' tunnels, and my opponent's source suggests this is ideal (though they agree it is not what's currently happening due to 'political will'). But consider this - the EPA was recently told, in America, that many of their nuclear deposits could last a million years [4]. No seal can survive that long. Even pure diamond, several meters thick would crack and break, just as all the diamonds from the past million years have cracked and broken. The ground may be stable now, but as it has been unstable in the past million years, so too will it be unstable again.The problem with the waste is that it's radioactive. According to almost every expert, there is no safe level of radioactivity [5]. A Geiger counter only measures how quickly you are approaching your death. We know that miners and plant workers who recieved only mild doses of radiation have died of various cancers [6]. People die from nuclear energy, even when done correctly (mind you, human error doesn't help).Construction costs are rising, construction is taking longer, operational costs are rising [8], and while there are promising next-generation reactors (some of which my opponent mentioned) they should not be legalised for construction until they have been properly scientifically tested. All this is to fund the creation of over 12.3 million kilograms of toxic waste every year, from the United States alone [7]. No renewable energy source has a by-product that dangerous or large. This is immoral, because of the heavy cost in human lives. Just as nuclear weapons are bad because of the immediate cost in human lives, so nuclear power is bad because of the long-term cost in human lives. Never forget that just one month before Chernobyl, the Economist said nuclear power was 'as safe as a chocolate factory.'The danger of nuclear weapons is already well-known. A nuclear power station is nothing more than an extremely slow nuclear weapon, not designed to unleash its power in one explosion, but designed slowly to poison.And now on to con's case.Con gives four reasons why recklessly and dangerously polluting the world is OK. I'll deal with them in reverse order. Jobs, his fourth point, is moot because any jobs lost from not having nuclear might equally be gained from having another power source. So instead of people checking on the safety of nuclear reactors, perhaps they can employ engineers to monitor tidal energy constructions.Thirdly con says we get cheap electricity. The US Department of Energy researched this in their 'Levelized Cost of New Generation Resources in the Annual Energy Outlook 2011'. They found that an advanced nuclear power plant could produce electricity at $109-$124 per megawatt hour. That's cheap - but wind energy was only $81-$115. Geothermal was only $91-$115. Hyrdoelectric was $58-$121. Biomass, still in its infancy, was already just $99-$133. So clearly nuclear is far from the cheapest option! Con's sources are largely from the lobby group 'World Nuclear Association' - in their words, they are 'promoters' and 'supporters' of nuclear energy [9] so not exactly an unbiased group! Their membership is comprised of companies who all have a financial stake in nuclear power [10]. Just because my opponent sources some assertions by this unscientific lobby group doesn't mean their claims hold water. His only other relevant source states 'I’m quite frankly more interested in cheaper solar and fuel cell options, which is where I think the primary future of energy generation is headed (with some supplementation from wind and geothermal)' (emphasis added).Secondly con says nuclear power is safe. I agree completely that nuclear is just as safe as other energy. The only problem is that when a solar panel breaks down, a couple of people moan because the electricity goes out. When a nuclear plant breaks down, the whole planet jumps up and starts screaming. As I've already sourced, nuclear plants are on a trend of becoming more expensive, countering that part of the argument. And his Wikipedia source about workers being competant states there is a serious accident once every 8 years or so. When dealing with things so contaminative, so dangerous, this is completely unacceptable. And con thinks he can hold these things for a million years after they're in the plant without anything ever going wrong! And we can keep making advancements with my exemption for scientific research. Until we know how to properly contain the waste, we should not deal with it.Firstly, con says nuclear energy is cleaner. There is a danger, I think, of environmentalism being confused with climate change. Climate change is one problem - we face MANY more, including a radiation-filled environment which causes cancers and death. So while nuclear emits less CO2 than solar (if you foolishly exclude construction emmissions and refinement emmissions), the point is that they have a wildly different effect on the environment anyway. I believe renewability may be a problem (uranium is a finite resource) but even if nuclear power was totally sustainable, the sustained destruction of our planet and people would be still worse than temporary destruction. And that thing he says about waste being safe and containable... oh look, that's another unsupported assertion from our new favorite lobby group, the World Nuclear Association. Nuclear power is not green.All of con's arguments just don't hold water.Recently the world has been angry at Iran for developing nuclear technology. I think they're right, but the rest of the world shouldn't be so hypocritic about it! Nuclear power is dangerous. I'll continue my case in a moment, once con has had a chance to respond.</h>

    <t>Unfortunately my opponent wasn't able to post their rebuttal. This is a pretty clear vote for con.</t>
<h>I thank my opponent for a fun debate. To voters, don't think that just because con cited a million lobby groups he has any credibility. He has misquoted and twisted sources, as I have shown, quoted personal opinions of lobby group members as facts, and ignored almost all of my sources. But on to what actually matters in the debate - the arguments:WasteFirst, on solar energy. I've already said solar panels can be safely recycled. My opponent's source is an article detailing how solar companies are setting up recycling programmes. Con also drops pretty much all of my counter-arguments from last round, such as how their quantity is much smaller than nuclear and how we aren't 'throwing out' anything, only REMOVING these dangerous chemicals from the environment and putting them into solar cells.Second, on wind energy. Hey look, it's a new argument in round four! My opponent claims wind is a waste of money. Well, that's much better from a moral perspective than a waste of human lives, which is what nuclear does! My opponent's main source that wind is a waste of money is a letter to the editor of a newspaper expressing an extremist opinion (and the author is the executive director of an organisation sponsored by nuclear lobbyists called 'Great Lakes Wind Truth'). I've already provided evidence that wind is not any more costly than nuclear, and in fact the US government says it's cheaper. The wind lobbyists claim their turbines cost only five cents per kwh (cheaper than coal by a mile!) [1], and I think they'd know better than the nuclear lobbyists. 500 homes is quite a bit considering that most wind farms have hundreds, if not thousands of turbines.Third, my opponent notes radiation occurs with geothermal energy. Wow, more new arguments. That's because geothermal requires an energy input - usually it requires about 1kw for a geothermal plant to generate 5kw. In the USA (con's source is from the US government), this initial current is usually generated with a nuclear reactor. I say - why not do what NZ does, and use hydroelectric or wind to generate that initial 1kw? No radiation is generated as part of the geothermal generation process, and NO byproducts are generated unless it's broken (waste fluid is re-injected back into the Earth).Fourth, hydroelectric. As with wind energy, don't believe con's assertions that it's more expensive. It isn't. Fish population displacement is a problem, so any potential site would need to be evaluated for this purpose to check that fish can still breed etc. Many newer hydroelectric dams have elaborate systems to allow fish to be elevated up and down the dam, circumventing this problem.Next my opponent sources three more lobby-group assertions (seriously, stop quoting World Nuclear!) to boost his sources count. All three assertions I have already countered.It's not just that waste is the main issue. It's the danger that the waste poses to human lives. Con has never specifically addressed this fact. No other industry has so much waste - indeed, no green energy has ANY toxic byproducts from electricity generation. I never said I wanted to ban coal, I said I'm against coal power plants, so my opponent's coal assertions are irrelevant.I didn't drop any of the argument concerning safe waste disposal because it didn't exist. My opponent made no case in round three that it was safe except for a breif assertion that I answered with reference to a scientific study that I had already cited. Regulations do not make waste safe. No regulation can stop a major environmental disaster breaking them open, or the radiation that we KNOW is leaking out. More importantly, no regulation IS doing it. Also I did talk about Lead at the same time as I talked about Mercury - ever used a lead-acid battery, con?And about the economists who don't like solar cells, the Chinese point out that to make the solar panels they use American equipment, and sell them to America so that America can make money off them. It's really a win-win for both countries. Also my opponent confused exports and imports last round. I guess some economists really are stupid... [2]WeaponsMy weapons analogy was not to show that a nuclear power plant behaves like a nuclear weapon. My point was to show that they are the same except one is operating in a controlled fashion. That's not conceeding the debate, or even the argument. Con has never even addressed the point. I'm not referring to a dirty bomb or any explosive device at all. I'm just saying that the same dangerous effects felt by places around a nuclear bomb in ten seconds are felt in places around a nuclear power plant in 1000 years or so.JobsI said in round one that I would not instantly fire all nuclear workers. There are many jobs in decommissioning plants (usually even more than are required for their running), plus there would be jobs in all the other things that would need decommissioning. That would give time for capital investment to flow into the clean energy sector and create the jobs. Nuclear power has created more jobs because they've had more investment - and despite this, wind and solar have had far more new capacity additions [3]. I've already proven that solar is better in terms of job creation (see last round). It's not just that I'm scared. It's that there are tangible harms to me being right, and tangible benefits to following my model even if I'm wrong. More jobs is a tangible benefit of following my model.CostAgain, my opponent shows his ineptitude at reading sources. It doesn't say 67 cents, it says 67 dollars. And it included nuclear power plant tax breaks and subsidies. The study I cited did not include any government market manipulation and was therefore a much better way to evaluate relative costs. It also used a much larger number of data points, using the whole of the USA instead of just California.SafetyI've already provided a source proving that there is NO HARMLESS LEVEL OF RADIATION. Every tiny bit of radiation has some impact. X-rays last a few seconds at most - these people had to live with all that radiation for years! And his only source saying the contrary comes from World Nuclear's spin doctors, not the medical doctors whom I cited. On my opponent's round 2 case, I dealt with that in round 2, and my opponent did not respond - he dropped it, not me.GreenLess pollutants is needed - so why is con supporting a power generation system that creates 12.3 million kilograms of pollutants for his country alone? Preventing climate change is a start, but not polluting other aspects of the environment is part of environmentalism too. Just ask Lucy Lawless and her Arctic buddies. My opponent continuously reasserts that nuclear is safe, but he does so only by citing lobby group articles, when I have cited scientific research showing the opposite. He has given no responses to any of these. I have shown other alternatives (green energy), and that it is not the presence of alternatives that constitutes a ban, but the danger of the waste produced by nuclear. About the CO2 graph, I talked about CO2 in rounds 2 and 3 already, my opponent is still trying to get me to repeat myself.Finally, con claims my arguments are circular. Obviously he does not know what a circular argument is. None of my premises have made it into my conclusions. Anybody who has the vaguest understanding of formal logic will be able to see that. And then to claim that I haven't attempted to counter his refutations shows that he clearly hasn't even read any of my round 2 case and is just making stuff up.It's time that the world woke up to the dangers of nuclear energy. We cannot support a system that creates so much un-necessary waste when there are so many better alternatives available. That's why I'm proud to affirm the motion.Vote pro!Sources1 - goo.gl/0dm6a2 - goo.gl/Ami4W3 - goo.gl/YqHlE</h>

    <t>Before I start I would to point out we are debating the energy source of nuclear power, not the weapons. (see definitions and visual)C1: Nuclear power is a green energyNuclear power is regulated by the epa [1] It has no emissions when in the fission process, and the 'smoke' is actually steam. [1, 2] It only emits population indirectly (mining uranium). Although not renewable, it is sustainable and green. [2, 3] Some newer in development reactors are are very sustainable and would power us for 5 billion years! [2, 4] That is the lifetime of the sun btw. [5] Another type of reactor takes the uranium from sea water, and this amount replenishes and never runs out, so would in fact be essentially renewable. [3, 6] One misconception is the waste is bad for the environment. The waste is easily containable and actually is being safely contained today. [7] Nuclear power is clean, and this is comparable to other power sources like solar, but function at much more higher efficiencies. [7] Also the goverment is pressing for greener energies, and nuclear is on the page for a green energy. [8]Now, the claims about nuclear power being dirty is false as they cannot emit CO2 and other gases directly, and if need be I will pull up stats showing they even emmits less then solar!C2: Safety of nuclear powerNuclear power plants are very durable and rarely break down, and their safety record compares to other energies. [9, 10] One argument is terrorists attacks, they have safeguards preventing this and other security systems. [9] Also its never happened. [9] Also the plant will not explode as the uranium is only enriched to a 5% level. Their newer reactors usually have competent workers and are safe when the workers do their 'thing'. [11] The safety of nuclear power is great! Future development keeps plants safer and even more reliable. [15] Banning it would mean stopping production and advancements while we take the long amount of time to take them down. This means the power will become more dangerous while the deconstructions begin as they will be old models. Keeping it going means they get safer. C3: CostNuclear power is comparable to other cheap forms of energy. [12] The actual fuel costs for nuclear power are relatively small. [12] The costs of nuclear power re cheaper then coal (a cheap power source), natural gas, and oil/ [12] Nuclear power currency supplies 1% of the worlds energy at low costs. [13] The plants are cheap to operate and are only costly when building the plant. [13] Nuclear power competes in prices with all energy forms as nuclear production is cheap. [13] People are making thorium nuclear power which CANNOT melt down ever or be weaponized. They are also cheap. [14] These new plants mean the future of nuclear power will be cheaper and safer. [14] Nuclear power is 25% cheaper then coal and less then 25% if the cost of gas. [16]C4: JobsThe nuclear industry is expanding, even in the bad economy. [17] One nuclear power plant alone hires 1-2000 people. [17] And others in temporary building procedures. [17] Not only is this power green and safe, but would create thousands of jobs in the US. [18] In Canada alone they employ 66,000 people. [19]---gt; ConclusionNeed I say more? Nuclear power ought to be allowed as one of the green energies of america.</t>

    <t>I thank my opponent for re-instigating this topic for me. This is an acceptance round so I'll just post my model (so con knows what he's arguing against, more exactly).  My contention is that, by international treaty, nuclear power should be outlawed. Obviously this could not be done overnight - reactors take an awfully long time to shut down, and then there's thousands of nuclear-powered weapons to take care of. An exception would be made for some scientific research, under very carefully controlled conditions. In general, no such experiment should involve the generation of very large amounts of nuclear power except in extraordinary circumstances, and then only very briefly. The ICC would be empowered to arbritrate if nuclear power use was suspected, either in a civil or a military capacity.  I wish my opponent very good luck for the debate and look forward to reading his opening round!</t>

    <t>1st round acceptanceno semantics with the title8000 charactersyou (my opponent) have the BOP, as you advocate a change in the status quo. Nuclear power:Power, especially electricity, the source of which is nuclear fission or fusion.</t>
<h>~ WASTE ~Waste for SOLAR:Solar panels contain some of the most toxic metals in the business of electricity generation. [1] These modules last about 20 years so when you throw them out you are throwing out potentially toxic waste into the environment. [1]Waste from WIND: Other then the mining involved, the wastes for wind are another story: Money. [2] further more wind power can only power 500 homes per turbine on average. [3] So it is efficient and costly. Nuclear is one of the most efficient power sources. [4]Wastes from GEOTHERMAL:Actually geothermal has some radioactive waste products and emits many poisons gases into the air. [5]Wastes from HYDROELECTRIC: There is a lot of investment needed in hydroelectric costs and evaporate the water and displace local fish populations, and kill others. [6] So, all of his nothing statements are FALSE.'Nuclear wastes are neither particularly hazardous nor hard to manage relative to other toxic industrial wastes.' [7]'The amount of radioactive wastes is very small relative to wastes produced by fossil fuel electricity generation. ' [7]'Nuclear power is the only large-scale energy-producing technology which takes full responsibility for all its wastes and fully costs this into the product. ' [7]Really if waste is the main issue, then most electric industries should be banned, solar, and fossil fuels. If this is a major reason then we might as well say bye to all energy types. Now my opponent wants to ban coal?!?! Coal is a needed ingredient for steel making. [8] Still: If waste is an issue all fossil fuels and solar energies should be banned too. Your reasoning is very circular. Then my opponent talks about mercury. Actually it has lead and other metals that are linked to kidney and lung damage. [9] Solar panels are the FUTURE of toxic waste. Once again if waste is a problem then almost all energy types should be banned. This argument is all fallacious and has very circular reasoning. He drops all of my argument regarding SAFE waste disposal, regulations making it safe, and NRC and EPA checks making it safe. Actually the imports from china Solar cells hurt the US solar company's. [10] I found a whole bunch of economists on my side. Challenge accepted. ~Weapons! YAY! wait...~SPLITTING THE ATOM!!!!! MY opponent basically conceded here. Nuclear plants create nuclear fission which is where we let the atoms decay releasing photons and neutrons. [11] In that case, nuclear power has nothing to do with nuclear weapons, therefore you have basically unknowingly conceded. What you are referring to is known as a dirty bomb. [12] It is pop a grenade off goes the nuclear plant! The only way you can do this is if a crazy gets into the plant, there are many regulations, laws, and training that prevent this. [12] Also you then claim the plant can go boom like bomb, false. There are many barriers inside and outside of plants preventing these radiation leaks. [13]Also:Q. Can a nuclear plant explode like a nuclear weapon?A. ' Absolutely not. A nuclear explosion is impossible in a commercial nuclear power plant. A power plant doesnâ€™t contain the type of fuel in the amount which is needed to make atomic bombs.' [13]Your argument about weaponize is utterly false. Drops my enrichment argument.~jobs!~I seriously think your reasoning is well, a fallacy. Banning the power would mean thousands of people out of a job, and you try to claim it is ok. How? If they are fired they will not instantly get a job again! This reasoning is utterly false. Nuclear power has created new 15,000 jobs in only a few years, and solar only 7000. [14, 15] Nuclear power increases state economic worth and creates more revenues. [14] Even if other energies are better (name one in job creation), Nuclear still deserves to stay, and in my opinion your arguments are all just 'I'm scared, so is Greenpeace, lets ban it' which is kind of a poor argument. ~cost~Um... OK he wants megawatts XD Nuclear in the US costs 67 cents per MWH. [16] On the table its the cheapest one except its tied with geothermal and barely over wind. Need I say more? (dang sources take up all the room... have to be brief). ~Safety~ Lol time for 3 miller! The amount of radiation exposure to people was so small it was harmless. [17] It gave less radiation exposure then an X-ray. [17] 'There were no injuries or adverse health effects from the Three Mile Island accident. ' [18] No accidents, little exposure, it must have been contained to only have this minor effects. He drops the majority of my round 2 case on the subject. ~Green~Emitting less pollutants is needed for a green energy! Preventing climate change is needed for being green. As I stated above Nuclear is actually very efficient (see above). My opponent claims I ignore the radiation. No I have not. I have stated many times how the workers keep it contained, have blocks preventing radiation leaks, and have proven many times that nuclear is safe. Also, you have cited no other single alternatives! Also, alternatives constitute a ban? If so then that is absurd! Macs in many peoples eyes are alternatives to PC's, wanna ban PC's? No. Wanna ban Macs because PC's may be alternatives? NO. The point is having alternatives doesn't constitute a ban, and I have proven the arguments of 'crap radiation!' are false, and well fallacies. All of the arguments presented are circular as you have provided no reasons they are not green except for waste, I refuted this with great facts and you totally act like its not there and claim it is still dangerous. I have refuted all of this, and you have not countered my refutations. I am forced to extend much of my argument from round 3. Here's a pretty graph about polluting! </h>

    <t>Yay, I managed to get this short enough at last!I thank con for getting this going. In doing this debate, I follow in the great tradition of New Zealand's former prime minister David Lange. In 1985 at Oxford Union, in a debate so intense even the US president tuned in, he fought against Jerry Falwell, a noted friend of then-US-president Ronald Regan, arguing against the motion 'nuclear weapons are morally indefensible'. Lange became the first person in decades to recieve a standing ovation from both sides of the house [1]. Today I am arguing against nuclear energy. Not just big civilian nuclear power plants. Not just nuclear weapons. Not just nuclear clocks or submarines. I argue that the use of nuclear power in all its forms is morally indefensible.After Lange's awesome speech, New Zealand abolished nuclear weapons. Despite claims by the US that we'd need nuclear power plants, nuclear submarines patrolling our shores, and so on and so forth, we have remained nuclear free to this day [2]. And guess what? We're not facing an energy crisis. Our national defense is far less at risk than that of every single nuclear country. And our people have never regretted the decision.Recently, Germany, a major nuclear nation, said they will move toward doing the same as New Zealand by 2022. So far progress has been good, indicating that it is not beyond the realm of possibility for other large nations to follow our lead.Today, I argue that such a model would be beneficial to the whole world, for one simple moral reason. Every nuclear device, when it generates energy, generates waste that we cannot safely dispose of. Take, for instance, the United States in America. The very latest in nuclear technology. The wisest of scientists and engineers. And yet even they dispose of most of their waste by throwing it to the bottom of swimming pools. Incredulously, some people at the NAS actually bothered to examine whether this was dangerous or not, and their results were exactly as you would expect [3]. Some waste is thrown to the bottom of 'sealed' tunnels, and my opponent's source suggests this is ideal (though they agree it is not what's currently happening due to 'political will'). But consider this - the EPA was recently told, in America, that many of their nuclear deposits could last a million years [4]. No seal can survive that long. Even pure diamond, several meters thick would crack and break, just as all the diamonds from the past million years have cracked and broken. The ground may be stable now, but as it has been unstable in the past million years, so too will it be unstable again.The problem with the waste is that it's radioactive. According to almost every expert, there is no safe level of radioactivity [5]. A Geiger counter only measures how quickly you are approaching your death. We know that miners and plant workers who recieved only mild doses of radiation have died of various cancers [6]. People die from nuclear energy, even when done correctly (mind you, human error doesn't help).Construction costs are rising, construction is taking longer, operational costs are rising [8], and while there are promising next-generation reactors (some of which my opponent mentioned) they should not be legalised for construction until they have been properly scientifically tested. All this is to fund the creation of over 12.3 million kilograms of toxic waste every year, from the United States alone [7]. No renewable energy source has a by-product that dangerous or large. This is immoral, because of the heavy cost in human lives. Just as nuclear weapons are bad because of the immediate cost in human lives, so nuclear power is bad because of the long-term cost in human lives. Never forget that just one month before Chernobyl, the Economist said nuclear power was 'as safe as a chocolate factory.'The danger of nuclear weapons is already well-known. A nuclear power station is nothing more than an extremely slow nuclear weapon, not designed to unleash its power in one explosion, but designed slowly to poison.And now on to con's case.Con gives four reasons why recklessly and dangerously polluting the world is OK. I'll deal with them in reverse order. Jobs, his fourth point, is moot because any jobs lost from not having nuclear might equally be gained from having another power source. So instead of people checking on the safety of nuclear reactors, perhaps they can employ engineers to monitor tidal energy constructions.Thirdly con says we get cheap electricity. The US Department of Energy researched this in their 'Levelized Cost of New Generation Resources in the Annual Energy Outlook 2011'. They found that an advanced nuclear power plant could produce electricity at $109-$124 per megawatt hour. That's cheap - but wind energy was only $81-$115. Geothermal was only $91-$115. Hyrdoelectric was $58-$121. Biomass, still in its infancy, was already just $99-$133. So clearly nuclear is far from the cheapest option! Con's sources are largely from the lobby group 'World Nuclear Association' - in their words, they are 'promoters' and 'supporters' of nuclear energy [9] so not exactly an unbiased group! Their membership is comprised of companies who all have a financial stake in nuclear power [10].

And it included nuclear power plant tax breaks and subsidies. The study I cited did not include any government market manipulation and was therefore a much better way to evaluate relative costs. It also used a much larger number of data points, using the whole of the USA instead of just California.SafetyI've already provided a source proving that there is NO HARMLESS LEVEL OF RADIATION. Every tiny bit of radiation has some impact. X-rays last a few seconds at most - these people had to live with all that radiation for years! And his only source saying the contrary comes from World Nuclear's spin doctors, not the medical doctors whom I cited. On my opponent's round 2 case, I dealt with that in round 2, and my opponent did not respond - he dropped it, not me.GreenLess pollutants is needed - so why is con supporting a power generation system that creates 12.3 million kilograms of pollutants for his country alone? Preventing climate change is a start, but not polluting other aspects of the environment is part of environmentalism too. Just ask Lucy Lawless and her Arctic buddies. My opponent continuously reasserts that nuclear is safe, but he does so only by citing lobby group articles, when I have cited scientific research showing the opposite. He has given no responses to any of these. I have shown other alternatives (green energy), and that it is not the presence of alternatives that constitutes a ban, but the danger of the waste produced by nuclear. About the CO2 graph, I talked about CO2 in rounds 2 and 3 already, my opponent is still trying to get me to repeat myself.Finally, con claims my arguments are circular. Obviously he does not know what a circular argument is. None of my premises have made it into my conclusions. Anybody who has the vaguest understanding of formal logic will be able to see that. And then to claim that I haven't attempted to counter his refutations shows that he clearly hasn't even read any of my round 2 case and is just making stuff up.It's time that the world woke up to the dangers of nuclear energy. We cannot support a system that creates so much un-necessary waste when there are so many better alternatives available. That's why I'm proud to affirm the motion.Vote pro!Sources1 - goo.gl/0dm6a2 - goo.gl/Ami4W3 - goo.gl/YqHlE</t>

    <t>I thank my opponent for his counter-argument.WasteLet's take a look at the total amount of byproducts produced by various forms of generating energy in the USA:Wind - nothingSolar - nothingTidal - nothingGeothermal - nothingHydroelectric - nothingNuclear - 12.3 million kilograms of toxic wasteSo the idea that nuclear emits less toxic byproducts than other industries is a complete lie. Now, is it safe to produce 12.3 million kilograms of toxic waste per year? You can have all the regulation in the world and it still wouldn't be safe! He claims that the huge metal water-vaults (aka toxic swimming pools) are safe, and yet I've already provided a scientific study showing that they're not. Finally he says that there is a financial incentive for the companies to keep them safe. I agree, but I contend that they cannot be kept safe. The companies are going for short-term profit over long-term environmental protection.I agree that coal isn't a good alternative, but how about not comparing nuclear to other crappy forms of energy, and instead comparing it to good energy? If the motion was for abolishing coal-based power plants then I'd be all for it, but right now let's deal with the topic at hand.Then he says nuclear byproducts are less toxic than solar ones. First, those aren't byproducts of electricity generation, they're construction byproducts. Second, the byproducts we're talking about are things like lead and mercury. They're dangerous if handled frequently, but completely safe inside a cell (like how mercury is safe in thermometers or lead in lead-acid batteries), particulary a cell that isn't handled frequently. If a solar panel ever leaks, it can be simply and safely recycled, unlike radioactive material. It is far safer for mercury to be inside a solar cell than for it to be out there in the environment. Same thing applies to lead. The differences to nuclear are that:1) the byproducts are not byproducts because they are part of the cell, not buried or drowned, and2) there is a much smaller quantity of them than 12.3 million kilograms, and3) enriched, spent uranium isn't a naturally-occuring thing we are removing from the environment, rather we are adding it.That's why nuclear is worse.Finally he talks about China importing the solar cells. Oh no, you're boosting your exports! I doubt you'll find an economist who says that more money for American businesses is bad for the American economy.WeaponizationLet's take a step back. What is a nuclear weapon? Dictionary.com defines it as 'an explosive device whose destructive potential derives from the release of energy that accompanies the splitting or combining of atomic nuclei.' Now what is a nuclear reactor? Dictionary.com gives the very unhelpful answer of 'a reactor', but thefreedictionary.com defines it as 'a device in which a nuclear reaction is maintained and controlled for the production of nuclear energy'. So, the differences are that one is explosive and destructive, and the other is maintained and controlled. Other than that, the two are exactly the same. A reactor is a maintained and controlled bomb. As to required enrichment, it is true that one requires a different critical mass for a nuclear chain reaction compared with just a slow nuclear reaction, but BOTH are harmful to people and the environment. Both solutions are therefore bad.Also, I think the US would be much safer if they were peaceful and stayed out of everybody's way too, but I digress. The point is that nuclear technology is NOT required for a strong national defense - if anything, it just gives foreign countries and terrorists another thing to attack.JobsRemember how I said Germany is getting rid of their power plants? At a time when unemployment in many places, such as almost every single nuclear nation, is at a record high, guess who are enjoying their lowest unemployment rate in two decades? That's right - Germany - with the interviewed economist even noting that 'all available indicators still point to a further improvement of the German labour market' [3]. So why is my opponent so wrong?Firstly he says that solar could only create 10,000 jobs total. If you look at his source, however, he has missed a zero at the end of that number, so it should read 100,000 jobs - and that's not the 'total' jobs, that's just the initial ones, for as it says 'jobs would only go up over a longer period'. He then states that 11% of wind energy jobs are in construction, and 5% are in maintenance. If you look at his source, it doesn't state these percentages anywhere, so he's clearly just making stuff up. I agree that the nuclear industry employs 50,000 people - but when solar energy ALONE, ignoring all the other forms of green energy, will generate 100,000 jobs right from day one if expanded, you bet jobs would boom. Just like they boomed in New Zealand after we banned it, and in Germany after they banned it.CostMy opponent has simply mistaken megawatts for kilowatts. 1 kilowatt = 0.001 megawatts. Bearing this in mind, my source actually estimates the hourly cost of nuclear even cheaper than many of con's sources. And I agree that nuclear is cheaper than fossil fuels. However, green energy remains the cheapest. His source asserting that nuclear energy is the cheapest did not take into account any green energy production, only fossil fuel.SafetyA meltdown is not the only way nuclear energy can break down, so meltdown regulation is a bit of a waste of time. Our favorite lobby group, world nuclear, tells us they try hard to minimise accidents, but the fact is we're still facing a major accident every 8 years or so, despite all these 'newer' designs (by the way, the idea that nuclear is too modern to break down predates Chernobyl by a few decades, and was in that Economist article I talked about last round). Then he cites another lobby-group article saying the accidents are easily controlled, using the example of three-mile island. That's where 40,000 gallons of radioactive waste water was dumped into a river, 140,000 people were evacuated, and $1 billion was spent on the cleanup [1]. That's far from being 'easily contained' - the accident wasn't contained at all! That's the worst accident in the US involving nuclear power plants. The worst involving solar power? Nobody cares what that is, because when solar power fails, there is zero health risk. Same for all the other green energy solutions by the way. And given how long the list of nuclear power plant accidents is [2] (and that's excluding incidents and accidents at the Springfield power plant), I doubt that any level of training will help the situation.GreenAgain, I don't care what emits more CO2. Don't confuse environmentalism with climate change (though my opponent is wrong about the CO2 thing - solar has zero running emmissions, only construction emmissions from mining minerals used in solar cells, but nuclear power plant construction takes longer and emits more). I also don't care about sustainability, which my opponent tries to talk about twice. A sustainable nuclear power plant is a bad thing, because all that while it will be killing you and your descendants, among other harmful effects. On my part, I do worry about that. I worry about it a lot. We don't need to poison ourselves with more radiation. There are other, cheaper, and most importantly, cleaner alternatives available. My opponent continues to ignore this. We don't need nuclear power to save the planet. We don't want nuclear power to pollute us.My opponent's arguments are wrong, his sources are either lobbiests or misquoted, and he has failed to respond to my case. The motion stands.</t>

    <t>~Refutation to the Pros case~It seems as though my opponent seems to worry about the nuclear power being weaponized, and its byproducts. He implies weaponized as he diverges into nuclear weapons, and as I stated in the definitions this debate is about electricity. R1: Weaponization We are not arguing whether or not it is justified to have nuclear weapons, so I assume you mean they may be weaponized therefore need to be banned. This argument is fairly faulty. The technology to actually make uranium enriched enough to be used in weapons is a process that has nothing to do with nuclear power. [1] Further more the plants use techniques with the uranium basically rendering it useless for weaponize techniques. Nuclear fuel it enriched from 3-5%. [2] You need 90% enriched uranium for nuclear weapons. [3] Linking Nuclear weapons to nuclear power is absurd. [1] Also you claim their defense is less at risk. New Zealand is not like the US, they are peaceful and out of the way. [4] Their peace may not be their nuclear abolishment, rather they do not patrol the middle east. R2: WasteMy opponents main case is the waste. He claims the waste is unstoppable and radioactive. Lets refute first his views on the storage. Many plants store them in huge metal vaults (under security big time) filled with water, this keeps the radiation inside. [5] The waste actually overtime becomes non hazardous. [6] The EPA and the NRC constantly regulate and check the disposal to make sure the storage is safe, unlike you claim. [6] Further more my opponent claims a byproduct so 'large'. This is actually false. The Nuclear industry actually emits less byproducts then other industries. [7] The only waste problem that you cite that makes any sense is what the waste is. Also the nuclear industry takes FULL responsibility for their waste is any problem occurs. (like they have to pay for it). [8] Why does this matter? Because they now have a financial reason to keep the storage system safe. Nuclear actually emits less waste then coal. [8, 9] (this ties in next). Methods for Safer underground storage sites are being researched. [8]Then my opponent claims the byproducts from nuclear are the most hazardous. Before we do this, let me cite things about our buddy coal. Well our buddy coal has more radioactive waste then Nuclear. [10] Who would have though that? Well sorry coal, we are not buddies anymore. Now, as I have proven Nuclear waste is stored with great regulation hindering it safe. Now, what about the byproducts from, lets say solar? Some solar cells have many nasty byproducts as well. They use many toxic materials. [11] Now, how is this worse then nuclear? Nuclear Stores the waste in safe facilities, whereas solar cannot store the waste. So in a comparison your argument is false as coal is already more radioactive, and solar has toxic byproducts that are not even stored. Further more (economically speaking) solar has a terrible type of problem: China. China imports most of the solar cells in the US. [12]Also objections to the nuclear power/weapon see above.Defense of my case~ Jobs ~My opponent claims this is false. As I stated the nuclear industry woudl make 3,000 jobs or more per plant. The Solar industry can only make 10,000 new jobs total. [13] In this case Nuclear is better then this green energy. For wind, 11% of the jobs are building the turbine, 5% for maintenance. [14] Why is this significant? Because this means 15% of the jobs wind creates are temporary jobs. The Nuclear business has 56,000 people working for it. banning this energy means 50,000 people lose jobs. [15]~ Cost of nuclear Power ~My opponent claims it costs 109$ per killowatt hour. I disagree:'Since 1987 the cost of producing electricity from has decreased from 3.63 cents per KWHr to 1.68 cents per KWHr in 2004 and plant availability has increased from 67% to over 90%.' [16] 2$ is far off from what you claim! Nuclear Power is cheaper then all of the fossil fuel types, and competes with coal, a very cheap Fossil Fuel. [17] Also this:'The nation’s 103 nuclear reactors were the lowest cost electricity producers of any source of expandable, baseload electricity in 2002.' [18]~ Safety ~'I agree completely that nuclear is just as safe as other energy. '~ My opponentHe basically conceded, and is only saying he is worried of a melt down. The NRC has many rules and regulations so it would be harder for melt-down situations to occur. [19] 'the design and operation of nuclear power plants aims to minimise the likelihood of accidents, and avoid major human consequences when they occur. ' [20]My opponent forgets the only accident recently is fukishima, which could be easily prevented with newer reactors. Chernobyl for example was due to a flawed design. Newer designs and regulations prevent these instances. As these accidents are rare, and when the happen are easily controlled (3 mile island) [21], and therefore your argument is mainly a consesion as these instances are rare and are easily controllable. The workers in these plants have rigorous training and can prevent and be able to stop the incident occurs, and control it if prevention measures fail. [22] ~Green energies~My opponent first goes after the emissions. My opponent concedes they Emmit's less emissions than solar. His counter is the construction. If It emits less then it will eventually even out and bet solar. There are actually methods that make nuclear powers uranium last forever by getting uranium from the sea. [23] So your worry is over... Also as I stated last round, these reactors work on thorium too, therefore will last longer there too. Worry on your part over. *Low on room*ConclusionMy opponent has not fulfilled his BOP (he has it all, 1st round) and in my opinion has no reasons to do with the energy forever. </t>

    <t>~ WASTE ~Waste for SOLAR:Solar panels contain some of the most toxic metals in the business of electricity generation. [1] These modules last about 20 years so when you throw them out you are throwing out potentially toxic waste into the environment. [1]Waste from WIND: Other then the mining involved, the wastes for wind are another story: Money. [2] further more wind power can only power 500 homes per turbine on average. [3] So it is efficient and costly. Nuclear is one of the most efficient power sources. [4]Wastes from GEOTHERMAL:Actually geothermal has some radioactive waste products and emits many poisons gases into the air. [5]Wastes from HYDROELECTRIC: There is a lot of investment needed in hydroelectric costs and evaporate the water and displace local fish populations, and kill others. [6] So, all of his nothing statements are FALSE.'Nuclear wastes are neither particularly hazardous nor hard to manage relative to other toxic industrial wastes.' [7]'The amount of radioactive wastes is very small relative to wastes produced by fossil fuel electricity generation. ' [7]'Nuclear power is the only large-scale energy-producing technology which takes full responsibility for all its wastes and fully costs this into the product. ' [7]Really if waste is the main issue, then most electric industries should be banned, solar, and fossil fuels. If this is a major reason then we might as well say bye to all energy types. Now my opponent wants to ban coal?!?! Coal is a needed ingredient for steel making. [8] Still: If waste is an issue all fossil fuels and solar energies should be banned too. Your reasoning is very circular. Then my opponent talks about mercury. Actually it has lead and other metals that are linked to kidney and lung damage. [9] Solar panels are the FUTURE of toxic waste. Once again if waste is a problem then almost all energy types should be banned. This argument is all fallacious and has very circular reasoning. He drops all of my argument regarding SAFE waste disposal, regulations making it safe, and NRC and EPA checks making it safe. Actually the imports from china Solar cells hurt the US solar company's. [10] I found a whole bunch of economists on my side. Challenge accepted. ~Weapons! YAY! wait...~SPLITTING THE ATOM!!!!! MY opponent basically conceded here. Nuclear plants create nuclear fission which is where we let the atoms decay releasing photons and neutrons. [11] In that case, nuclear power has nothing to do with nuclear weapons, therefore you have basically unknowingly conceded. What you are referring to is known as a dirty bomb. [12] It is pop a grenade off goes the nuclear plant! The only way you can do this is if a crazy gets into the plant, there are many regulations, laws, and training that prevent this. [12] Also you then claim the plant can go boom like bomb, false. There are many barriers inside and outside of plants preventing these radiation leaks. [13]Also:Q. Can a nuclear plant explode like a nuclear weapon?A. ' Absolutely not. A nuclear explosion is impossible in a commercial nuclear power plant. A power plant doesnâ€™t contain the type of fuel in the amount which is needed to make atomic bombs.' [13]Your argument about weaponize is utterly false. Drops my enrichment argument.~jobs!~I seriously think your reasoning is well, a fallacy. Banning the power would mean thousands of people out of a job, and you try to claim it is ok. How? If they are fired they will not instantly get a job again! This reasoning is utterly false. Nuclear power has created new 15,000 jobs in only a few years, and solar only 7000. [14, 15] Nuclear power increases state economic worth and creates more revenues. [14] Even if other energies are better (name one in job creation), Nuclear still deserves to stay, and in my opinion your arguments are all just 'I'm scared, so is Greenpeace, lets ban it' which is kind of a poor argument. ~cost~Um... OK he wants megawatts XD Nuclear in the US costs 67 cents per MWH. [16] On the table its the cheapest one except its tied with geothermal and barely over wind. Need I say more? (dang sources take up all the room... have to be brief). ~Safety~ Lol time for 3 miller! The amount of radiation exposure to people was so small it was harmless. [17] It gave less radiation exposure then an X-ray. [17] 'There were no injuries or adverse health effects from the Three Mile Island accident. ' [18] No accidents, little exposure, it must have been contained to only have this minor effects. He drops the majority of my round 2 case on the subject. ~Green~Emitting less pollutants is needed for a green energy! Preventing climate change is needed for being green. As I stated above Nuclear is actually very efficient (see above). My opponent claims I ignore the radiation. No I have not. I have stated many times how the workers keep it contained, have blocks preventing radiation leaks, and have proven many times that nuclear is safe. Also, you have cited no other single alternatives! Also, alternatives constitute a ban? If so then that is absurd! Macs in many peoples eyes are alternatives to PC's, wanna ban PC's? No. Wanna ban Macs because PC's may be alternatives? NO. The point is having alternatives doesn't constitute a ban, and I have proven the arguments of 'crap radiation!' are false, and well fallacies. All of the arguments presented are circular as you have provided no reasons they are not green except for waste, I refuted this with great facts and you totally act like its not there and claim it is still dangerous. I have refuted all of this, and you have not countered my refutations. I am forced to extend much of my argument from round 3. Here's a pretty graph about polluting! </t>

    <t>A: Uniqueness - Populations are rising. Kates[1]writes: It took the world population millions of years to reach the first billion, then 123 years to get to the second, 33 years to the third, 14 years to the fourth, and 13 years to the fifth billion,The U.N.’s revisedpopulation projection estimated world populationwould swell to 11 billion by 2050. And the availability of drinkable water is decreasing for two reasons: 1 – Climate change is lessening our supply of water. The Arlington Institute[2] states: Climate change is depleting [the] supply of water. As the climate warms, glaciers in the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau have been melting. According to the IPCC, global temperatures have warmed by .76 Celsius over the last 100 years. In subsequent years, there will be less and less glacial meltwater to continuously supply India’s rivers.Nearly 70% of discharge to the River Ganges comes from Nepalese snow-fed rivers,if Himalayan glaciers dry up, so could the Ganges. The Ganges has numerous tributary rivers which supply water to hundreds of millions of people across India. Therefore, if the Ganges even partly dried up, it would have drastic consequences for a huge population. 2 – Government ability to gain drinkable water is failing. The Arlington Institute furthers: India receives an average of 4,000 billion cubic meters of rainfall every year. Unfortunately, only 48% of rainfall ends up in India’s rivers. Due to lack of storage and crumbling infrastructure, only 18% can be utilized. Rainfall is confined to the monsoon season,when India gets 75% of its total annual precipitation. Due to India’s storage crunch the government is unable to store surplus water for the dry season. Such uneven seasonal distribution of rainfall has not stimulated the development of better capturing and storing infrastructure, making water scarcity acritical problem. B: Link – The affirmative claims that everyone ought to have access to water as per their human rights links in because a) it lowers our supply of water to give to other people and b) further causes the population to rise by increasing the quality of life. C: Internal Link – As the population rises in the affirmative world, it causes us to deplete more and more resources, which has the potential to set up a very bad situation. Hance writes:[3] Wealth is dependent on the environment, and our environmentis both finite and increasingly plundered. There is a limited amount of oil, coal, and gold in the world. There is only so far one can push renewable resources. The rise of a global throwaway culture has resulted in an economy based on collapsing environmental capital, creating the ultimate bubble. As more people populate the planet the wealth disparity has been widening. Once our supplies reach a certain limit, and the population reaches a certain size, mass chaos comes from it. Kates 2 writes: Ecologists havecalculated [that] if world population grows to 10 billion people, that will create a “dire situation,” with “catastrophic” health and environmental problems. Birth rates would spiral out of control, and the crowded planet couldn’t continue to efficiently sustain its population, which would consume water at a faster rate than it could be renewed. There are physical limitations to how much food can be grown on the planet’s surface, and the density of a 10-billion person world would be incompatible  D: Impact – Once our world enters a state of water scarcity, it sets up the possibility of wide-spread conflict arising out of the need for water. The Arlington Institute states: More than two billion people worldwide live in regions facing water scarcity. In India this is a particularly acute crisis. Millions of Indianslack access to clean drinking water, and the situation is only getting worse. India’s demand for water is growing at an alarming rate. India’s populationis expected to overtake China’s by 2050 when it reaches1.6 billionputting strain on water resources as the numbergrows. A rapidly growing economy and a large agricultural sector stretch India’s supply of water thinner. Meanwhile, India’s supply of water is rapidly dwindling Climate change is expected to exacerbate the problem causing unpredictable weather, which could drastically diminish the water coming from rainfall and glaciers. As demand for potable water outstrip[s] supply in coming years, India will face a slew of problems, such as food shortages, intrastate, and international conflict. And by conflicts I’m not talking about just a simple skirmish. The conflict that I’m talking about is nuclear war. Klare writes:[4] The[re is an] inadequate capacity of poor countries to cope with the effects of change, and the resulting state collapse, civil war and mass migration. 'More than 300 million people in Africa currently lack access to safe water,' provoking more wars like Darfur. these scenarios use more deadly weapons. As oil and natural gas disappears, more countries will rely on nuclear power to meet their energy needs -- and this 'will accelerate nuclear proliferation as countries develop enrichment capabilities to ensure their national security. Drought, flooding and storms can kill us but so will wars among the survivors over what remains of food, water and shelter.  This impact is going to outweigh because: 1)      The affirmative is trying to save lives by giving everyone access to water, but by doing this they only damn people to death via nuclear war and eventual extinction via nuclear explosions and radiation. 2)      By advocating for the right to access drinking water, the affirmative only violates people’s base right to life in the long run, which prevents them from even accessing a right to drinking water. This case functions in two ways: 1)      It’s an independent reason to negate because I’m saying that by affirming, we violate the ultimate human right to life through causing a nuclear war. By negating, we prevent nuclear war, which solves back for the aff harms of dying from lack of water. 2)      It functions as a case turn to the affirmative because they’re advocating that we distribute water to all people, as per their human rights explicitly stated in the resolution. But I’m telling you that if we did that, we would only further violate their rights in the long run. So as long as I'm winning my side of the case, you have to vote con as I'm sufficiently case turning the entirety of the pro case. To respond to the pro case:  I concede the third point of my opponent's case. Since I'm not attacking the feasibility of giving everyone drinking water, this third point doesn't apply to the debate in any way. To respond to my opponent's two other points, the disadvantage I read functions as a turn to both of these contentions. Since my opponent read no framework, he MUST WIN both points in order to win. In order to win both points, he MUST sufficiently and successfully refute the disadvantage I read, since it functions as a turn to those two contentions.Since I lack characters to go further in depth to my opponent's arguments, I'll conclude here for the round.

    <t>I thank my peer for yet another fine round,  'I would claim that an increase in water would mean an INCREASE in food supplies, since we would have more water to use on things like irrigation and watering of plants and crops. Thus, he's commiting the correlation-causation fallacy. We are observing (or supposedly will observe) an increase in water, according to his sources, but this doesn't link to a decrease in food. If anything, it would cause an increase in available food.'  It has already been stated that an increase in temperature would lead to a decrease in water supply. My peer is correct in stating that an increase in water would aid to agricultural yields, yet that does not account for all factors. If scientists are correct that the planet might very well enter a 'mini ice-age' this would equal a decline in the space of time for crops to grow, thus yielding fewer crops. A period of colder temperatures would also lead to less terrain that would be 'farm able.' During the periods of cold known as ice-ages glacier advance upon lands, and reduces land that would otherwise be available. Warmer temperatures although reducing available freshwater, would not reduce seawater. Does my peer understand that seawater can be used for irrigating crops?  'A British company has created an irrigation system that can grow crops using salt water. The dRHS irrigation system consists of a network of sub-surface pipes, which can be filled with almost any water, whether pure, brackish, salted or polluted. The system can even take most industrial waste-water and use it without the need for a purification process.[1]'  I assure my peer that no correlation/causation fallacy is occurring as my reasoning is sound. Indeed it is quite logical and takes into account a multitude of factors for what climate would be most suitable for producing the highest agricultural yields. While my peers opinion accounts for one, availability of drinking water(freshwater).  'Since this is what he spent the largest part of his last round refuting, the majority of his refutations are thusly de-railed and are fallacious. You can extend out the first two pieces of evidence from the Arlington Institute as the very first place to vote con here, regardless of the other rounds.'  I would request to know how a majority of my refutations are fallacious? I would request my peer not throw around baseless accusations as it only lessens the integrity of the debate itself. Further, I will state that my peers evidence from the Arlington Institute proves nothing except:  A: Climate Change is reducing availability of current freshwater sources B: Governments are not doing a well enough job of obtaining freshwater.  I refuted point A by stating that there is one source unaccounted for, seawater through desalination. Which had the capability of solving the problem of water sources for a very long time. Indeed water makes up 71% of the earths surface, and out of that 71% only 3% of that water is 'freshwater', and this takes the cake here, ONLY .007% OF ALL WATER ON EARTH IS ABLE TO BE USED BY PEOPLE(not counting saltwater of course)[2]. This is water in rivers, aquifers, etc. One only needs to realize that to see that saline water(saltwater) is a solution that would work for generations. Finishing his second piece of evidence has nothing to do with actual availability, if these governments were efficiently storing/obtaining this water, there would conceivably only be a minor problem if one at all. In other words the evidence does not actually refute my argument at all, as it has nothing to do with the actual supply of water(except in stating that governments aren't doing well enough to capture/store available amounts.) Which I will repeat the point made in the previous round,  P4: 'P4: Because we possess the technology/ability to ensure every person has drinking water, we have a moral/ethical responsibility to ensure that every person does, to not would, again, be equivalent to murder.'  I have proven we possess the technology and therefore the means to ensure every person on the planet is afforded drinking water. My evidence has further shown that these solutions would solve the problem for quite a long time in the future, even with increases in population. Therefore disproving my peers claim that, 'The affirmative is trying to save lives by giving everyone access to water, but by doing this they only damn people to death via nuclear war and eventual extinction via nuclear explosions and radiation.' Beyond that my previous refutation that regardless of whether or not water was available to everyone, as well as being scarce or not, a war is likely to occur over another dwindling resource, and therefore we are damned if we do and damned if we dont, does a sufficient job of refuting the basis that a nuclear war is guaranteed if affirmatives position is taken.  My opponent states that his case functions in two ways, '1) It's an independent reason to negate because I'm saying that by affirming, we violate the ultimate human right to life through causing a nuclear war. By negating, we prevent nuclear war, which solves back for the aff harms of dying from lack of water. 2) It functions as a case turn to the affirmative because they're advocating that we distribute water to all people, as per their human rights explicitly stated in the resolution. But I'm telling you that if we did that, we would only further violate their rights in the long run. So as long as I'm winning my side of the case, you have to vote con as I'm sufficiently case turning the entirety of the pro case.'  Indeed so long as you are they would. Lets examine that further though to see if you are. First you have not outright proven that choosing the path of affirmative would result in nuclear war. That is but a hypothetical, a likely hypothetical given the scenario in the evidence. Yet it is entirely dependent upon water actually being a scarce resource. The evidence that I have brought forth shows not only that we possess the means to supply sufficient resources to meet the needs for water, but also shows this next point(notice the framework starting to piece together)  P5: Because we possess the technology and therefore the means to supply the worlds population with sufficient drinking water, to proclaim that drinking water is a 'scarce' resource, is false. Water is not scarce, we as a species simply are not using the tools at our disposal to solve the problems at hand.'  If water is not scarce, any war that would be caused over it would be humanities fault and solely humanities fault on basis of being downright lazy. To possess the means to prevent a catastrophe and not do so(whether its war or billions dying of thirst) is outrageous, morally reprehensible, and sickening.  'B: Link – The affirmative claims that everyone ought to have access to water as per their human rights links in because a) it lowers our supply of water to give to other people and b) further causes the population to rise by increasing the quality of life. C: Internal Link – As the population rises in the affirmative world, it causes us to deplete more and more resources, which has the potential to set up a very bad situation.'  If you insist I shall refute. I will point out that A in the first link is only true if water is scarce, a point I have already shown to be false. B is only a problem if there is no way to prevent population growth, yet the policy of child limits does actually work, and Ill point out that out of any option, its the least reprehensible one, 'China and India will face a triple threat.�Their birth rates have approached total fertility rates that are insufficient to maintain population levels.[3]' Also keep in mind that both China and India's standard of living is increasing, yet population is poised to decrease, thusly disproving causation.  Ahhh my kingdom for more space. Ill finish this next round. Onto you Zaradi. :)</t>

    <t>I thank my peer for such an extensive response.  My peer has made many good points, and I will attempt to refute each in turn. First I cede that the supply of resources in the planet is indeed finite. Yet is drinking water one of those that need be a problem? There is indeed a solution to the dwindling fresh water supply, a solution that is obvious enough. Considering the majority of the earth is composed of water, we need only look at the oceans to solve the problem. Yes, seawater is not drinkable, but it is as such because of its high saline(salt) content. We are able to desalinate water though, and have been doing as such for hundreds, if not thousands of years, 'Desalination/Distillation is one of mankind's earliest forms of water treatment, and it is still a popular treatment solution throughout the world today. In ancient times, many civilizations used this process on their ships to convert sea water into drinking water. Today, desalination plants are used to convert sea water to drinking water on ships and in many arid regions of the world, and to treat water in other areas that is fouled by natural and unnatural contaminants. Distillation is perhaps the one water treatment technology that most completely reduces the widest range of drinking water contaminants.[1]'  This solution as simple of a concept as it is, would require a massive global effort. Yet with the stakes being so high as my peer has stated, it is a step that must be taken. My peer also has falsely stated that by negating water as a right we would prevent a nuclear war. Yet even if we were to take this step, other dwindling resources would cause the same outcome. Therefore the situation has turned into one of, 'damned if we do, damned if we don't.' Logically speaking, whether or not a solution for water is found, another scarce resource, such as food will cause the same outcome.  On the note of climate change, I can only assume my peer realizes that .76 degrees Celsius temperature change within a 100 year period is well within the norm for previous temperature changes in Earths history. Indeed .76 degrees is quite mild as compared to, 'The ice core showed the Northern Hemisphere briefly emerged from the last ice age some 14,700 years ago with a 22-degree-Fahrenheit spike in just 50 years, then plunged back into icy conditions before abruptly warming again about 11,700 years ago.[2]' Yet he is correct in stating that it will affect the worlds freshwater supply negatively. As such we must begin taking steps immediately towards seeking alternative means of freshwater(desalination). The bonus to the warming would be, well, becoming warmer, 'Agriculture in the U.S. and other industrialized countries is expected to be less vulnerable to climate change than agriculture in developing nations, especially in the tropics, where farmers may have a limited ability to adapt. In addition, the effects of climate change on U.S. and world agriculture will depend not only on changing climate conditions, but will also depend on the agricultural sector's ability to adapt through future changes in technology, changes in demand for food, and environmental conditions, such as water availability and soil quality. Management practices, the opportunity to switch management and crop selection from season to season, and technology can help the agricultural sector cope with and adapt to climatic variability and change.' One need only be prepared, and if indeed there were such a catastrophe approaching us, the effort must be global. Also one important factor in this, as the planet becomes warmer, habitable land will increase, think Greenland, and Iceland becoming moderate temperature zones. This will increase available land for agriculture as well. If, and I will stress IF, humanity prepares properly, climate change(warming) could be beneficial. I will state that warming has the possibility of being beneficial, if it were to get colder(a distinct possibility) indeed much colder, think mini ice age, and scientists are saying that it is possible, if not likely, 'The supposed ‘consensus' on man-made global warming is facing an inconvenient challenge after the release of new temperature data showing the planet has not warmed for the past 15 years. The figures suggest that we could even be heading for a mini ice age to rival the 70-year temperature drop that saw frost fairs held on the Thames in the 17th Century. Based on readings from more than 30,000 measuring stations, the data was issued last week without fanfare by the Met Office and the University of East Anglia Climatic Research Unit. It confirms that the rising trend in world temperatures ended in 1997. Meanwhile, leading climate scientists yesterday told The Mail on Sunday that, after emitting unusually high levels of energy throughout the 20th Century, the sun is now heading towards a ‘grand minimum' in its output, threatening cold summers, bitter winters and a shortening of the season available for growing food. Solar output goes through 11-year cycles, with high numbers of sunspots seen at their peak. We are now at what should be the peak of what scientists call ‘Cycle 24' – which is why last week's solar storm resulted in sightings of the aurora borealis further south than usual. But sunspot numbers are running at less than half those seen during cycle peaks in the 20th Century. Analysis by experts at NASA and the University of Arizona – derived from magnetic-field measurements 120,000 miles beneath the sun's surface – suggest that Cycle 25, whose peak is due in 2022, will be a great deal weaker still.[3]' Indeed if this were the case, it would signal an increase in available freshwater from glaciers/snowmelt, but would spell disaster for agriculture, thus shifting the cause of a war from water, to food. Which supports the aforementioned statement, that a nuclear war over resources is likely regardless of whether or not water is scarce. Indeed water is perhaps the one problem that we can easily solve if enough effort is put into it. As we already have to technology to desalinate water in mass quantities, one need only build sufficient facilities to meet the need.  Continuing, my peers point is true, that government ability to secure drinking water is indeed failing. Yet this is not because we do not have the ability to meet the need. It is because there is not enough effort to solve the problem. In terms of survival of a species, need wealth even be necessary to undertake steps to solve problems? It shouldn't, yet sadly it is. This is more of a failing on humanities part, not because we do not posess the means and technology to do so, but rather because we do not see the unnecessary deaths of billions to be an urgent issue that must be solved now. A sad point indeed.  In terms of population growth, again my peer is correct that this poses a serious problem. Yet again it is a problem that can be solved. Indeed it can be done without harming anyone. A limit upon the number of children a couple(or person) can have is a way to solve it. It would not immediately solve the problem but within a couple of generations population would decrease. Think 1 child for every 2 people, and within a 50 year span one could surmise that a 8 billion pop. could become as little as 4, if not even less as not every person has children. I cant say I wholly agree with that solution morally and ethically, but it is a better alternative to a nuclear war.  Finally I will make one additional point,  P4: Because we posess the technology/ability to ensure every person has drinking water, we have a moral/ethical responsibility to ensure that every person does, to not would, again, be equivalent to murder.</t>

    <t>I thank my peer for yet another fine round. This has been quite fun.  'So right now, we can easily call the debate an easy win for the con.' I suppose its a good thing that you are not deciding. Anyways, let us see, can we really? In reference to point A, 'His only main point is to point out that China and India's population are poised to fall.' First off this piece of evidence was used in contention of Link part B and for a support in favor of child limits as a solution to population growth. It had nothing to do with point A. I concede point A. Population is growing, period. Regardless of whether China or India will have a reduction of population, other parts of the world will continue to increase. Eventually the population will reach a point that the planet cannot sustain.  It is only useful in refuting Link part B, and a support in favor of child limits. In this sense this piece of evidence is key, as without it the conclusion that, an increase in quality of life does not equal population growth is not true. Indeed if that were true then the nations with the highest quality of life should have the highest population. This successfully refutes link, 'b) further causes the population to rise by increasing the quality of life.'  Moving on to Link part, 'a) it lowers our supply of water to give to other people.' Of course this is only true if water cant be reused/renewed in any way. Which is not true, distillation and desalination are purification techniques that are completely effective in removing contaminants from water(not just salt). Using the seawater/waste water irrigation techniques water can be used, reused, distilled/purified and drank again. Netting, 0 loss of water. I have two bottles of water, a person uses a bottle, and I gain the bottle back after it is recycled.  'He's conceding the analysis under my link that says by giving people clean water to drink, we prevent deaths from things like dehydration and water pollution, thus increasing our population.' Please refer to china and India example. Also need I seriously address every minute detail of your argument? If quality of life is increasing in these countries(common knowledge will tell you it is) why is the population poised to drop? I will repeat what I stated in the previous round, this disproves causality. As it does this, the link that increased quality of life leads to population growth is negated. Regardless of what your logical deduction states, evidence does not back these assertions. Not to put too fine a point, it is false. As such there is nothing to link the affirmative position to my peers disad argument. Yet even though I no longer am required to respond further to this disad, I will anyways.  As of yet I have not had the chance to address the internal link. If my peer re-examines the previous round he will see that I was in the process of addressing both the link and, 'Internal Link – As the population rises in the affirmative world, it causes us to deplete more and more resources, which has the potential to set up a very bad situation.' Population will rise in the pro and the con world, I do believe Kates 1 proves this quite sufficiently. The internal link does not have sufficient reason to suggest that it will not raise in the con world and will in contrast reduce.  This plays nicely into my impact turn, 'Logically speaking, whether or not a solution for water is found, another scarce resource, such as food will cause the same outcome.' To state this more concisely as there appears to be confusion as to what exactly my arguments have been, Impact Turn: A nuclear war over resources is likely whether or not the affirmative position is taken. My previous damned if we do, damned if we dont statement was just a less abrupt way of putting it.  I of course concede the evidence used by my peer to support the impact turn, as this is the logical outcome of overpopulation as put forth by Kates 1 and 2 as well as Hance. The only part I refuted was that water was one of those problems that would result from Kates 2, indeed I have shown already how water is not scarce, and should not be considered as such. Thus even further removing any connection of the affirmative position to the internal link and the impact. Yet here I will supply more evidence in support of this,  Yes it is true that eventually the population will outgrow the supply of water, but given the techniques presented how long will it be till that will occur. Well considering, there is '326 million trillion gallons(roughly 1.3 billion trillion liters) [1]' of water on earth, and current consumption is, '828,748 billion liters a year,' and that will increase by, '64 billion cubic meters a year[1],' or 64 trillion liters per year, and we begin to see the enormity of the amount of water on earth and how long it would take to reach such a point if all used water were recycled and seawater were desalinated. Thousands of years is an extreme low-ball estimate. This magical 10 billion number may be true for other resources, but for water, its purely nonsense. Yet even more evidence that both turns the internal link, and the impacts connection to the affirmative position.  To tally my argument thus far I have:  1) Turned the link, this alone is reason to vote the affirmative position as my peers disad argument only works if there is a connection between the aff position and the disad. 2) Turned the Internal Link by removing all connection to the affirmative position, 3) Turned the Impact by removing all connection to the affirmative position, as well as proving water is not scarce. 4) Refuted Arlington 1 and 2. The only evidence that supports my peers conclusion that availability of drinking water is decreasing. Was this necessary? No, as both examples are extraneous to my peers argument and are useless. I admit I fell for this distraction ploy and wasted precious space.  Which leaves us with my points: P1: As a necessity for human survival access to drinking water should be ensured for all people. P2: To deny access to drinking water, regardless of reason is equivocal to murder, as without it, a person will die. P3: The feasibility of ensuring all are afforded access to clean drinking water, despite it being extremely difficult does not outweigh the previous two points.  P1 was conceded, yet P2 was not, P2 was refuted under the pretext that to ensure access to drinking water would result in a worse outcome(total extinction via nuclear war) and that pretext was proven false, therefore P2 still stands as valid. P3 was conceded therefore it is true. I further expanded upon these with:  P4: Because we possess the technology/ability to ensure every person has drinking water, we have a moral/ethical responsibility to ensure that every person does, to not would, again, be equivalent to murder. I have proven this to be true, and again the only refutation my peer offered was the same used to refute P2. For the same reasons P2 is valid so is P4.  P5: Because we possess the technology and therefore the means to supply the worlds population with sufficient drinking water, to proclaim that drinking water is a 'scarce' resource, is false. Water is not scarce, we as a species simply are not using the tools at our disposal to solve the problems at hand. This has been proven true in the same way that P4 was proven true.  Finishing, I will say that all of my points lay sufficient groundwork to vote affirmative on the basis that to not would be morally reprehensible on the grounds that it is equivalent to murder. Due to it being morally wrong we have a responsibility to ensure people are provided with the water necessary for survival. That the feasibility of ensuring this supply of water is outweighed by the moral reprehensibility of not. Wealth is never a sufficient reason to take the life of another, never has been, never will. Lastly, that water is not scarce.</t>

    <t>I thank my opponent for a valiant effort to refute my position. Unfortunately, he just isn't doing enough work to cover every aspect of my case, and thus will be his fatal flaw in the round.Before I go into refuting my opponent's refutations and extending my arguments, I'd like to point out one thing to the voters: my opponent did not extend a single piece of his case. He presents a new point for his case, but this point only further links him into the harms provided by my case. So far as he's not adressing the links to the argument at all, he's still biting straight into the harms, which is the main reason why we can vote con on the resolution right now, regardless of how the rest of the rounds go. Since he still links into the harms, this is going to turn his case, a point that he DID NOT REFUTE in his last round. So as far as I'm winning offense off of my case, it's sufficient to vote con on the resolution.A large portion of my opponent's last round was making a massive non-unique argument on the argument that available drinking water is decreasing, an argument I made in my A point (he didn't implicate his argument as one, but that's basically how he made it to function). Unfortunately for my opponent, he made a poor choice in which argument to spend the entirety of his time refuting, because this is an argument I don't need to win in order to be sufficiently extending offense off of my case. Although I will still refute his arguments, the majority of my time will go to other more important portions of my case. The main problem with my opponent's argument is it commits a massive corrolation-causation fallacy. He is proving that we're going to have an increase in water due to temperature changes from the sun cycle (or something along those lines) but he doesn't warrant as to why an increase in water would mean a decrease in food. I would claim that an increase in water would mean an INCREASE in food supplies, since we would have more water to use on things like irrigation and watering of plants and crops. Thus, he's commiting the corrolation-causation fallacy. We are observing (or supposedly will observe) an increase in water, according to his sources, but this doesn't link to a decrease in food. If anything, it would cause an increase in available food.Since this is what he spent the largest part of his last round refuting, the majority of his refutations are thusly de-railed and are fallacious. You can extend out the first two pieces of evidence from the Arlington Institute as the very first place to vote con here, regardless of the other rounds.  But now I would like to point to the virtually conceded Kates card that talks about an increase in population. Even if you're buying my opponent's refutations and the inherent non-unique made on the availability of water argument, this is still independant of that, thus sufficient for me to extend out as sufficient offense for my case to still link into the harm of nuclear war. All he does is propose to limit child birth to one kid per family, but there are a number of things wrong with this:1) We can look to China and see how this example just flat-out doesn't work. China has this exact policy for population control, yet has the world's largest population. While I don't know the exact reason for the increase in population, the policy that China has implemented hasn't solved a thing. So why would it be any better on a world-wide scale?2) This only further infringes on our rights as human beings to the pursuit of happiness, as families are often happier with more kids. There are very few families with JUST one kid, and forcing them to stop would only cause more unhappiness.3) There's no way to actually enforce this law. People can just have babies anyway and give them to foster homes or other organizations that could look after them. So it would be a pointless policy.4) The only real way to punish those who DO break the rule, if there was a way to enforce the rule, would be to either a) kill the baby when born, which is a MASSIVE rights violation and an outweighing harm to my opponent's case, or b) severely punish those who do give birth, which would only infringe on their rights further. Thusly, the policy he has in mind is an absolutely god-awful idea. As this is the ONLY argument placed against the very first piece of Kates evidence, you can extend this out as the second place to vote con, regardless of the other rounds.  Next, my opponent proposes a solution to the water scarcity crisis: desalinization of water. The only problem with this is he conceded a piece of evidence that directly responds back to this argument. Look to the second piece of Kates evidence under the C point. What this evidence is talking about is once our population reaches a certain level, a whole bunch of bad things start to occur, and we would start to outstrip supplies, like water, far faster than they could ever possibly be replaced. So the proposal to have water salinization, while appearing to be a good idea, won't do much to help us in the long run. So you can extend Kates 2 as the link to the impact.The Hance evidence was entirely conceded in my opponent's last speech. It provides a piece of the internal link to the impact. Since he concedes it, give it the strength of weight. Extend it out, this keeps his case biting into the harms provided in my case.So ultimately, once we start using up water at a faster rate than we could possibly supply it, as the Kates 2 evidence claims, we then reach the third piece of Arlington Institute evidence. This evidence claims that once we have a shortage of available fresh water, we will be facing problems such as intrastate and international conflicts. And these conflicts are nuclear war, as provided by the Klare evidence directly below it. These two cards were entirely unrefuted in my opponent's last speech, so give them the strength of weight. Because of these two arguments, by affirming the resolution my opponent inevitably seals our fate to be that of extinction by nuclear war. In this, you can extend out the two unrefuted reasons why this impact outweighs the impacts given in my opponent's case. By affirming, he a) causes us to all die from nuclear war, which is far worse than some of us dying from lack of clean water, and b) violates our rights to life in the long run, which prevents us from accessing the very rights he is advocating to get. Then extend the turn made at the bottom of the case that the disadvantage functions as. As long as I am sufficiently winning offense on my case, as I proven to you that I most definetely am, then I am effectively turning my opponent's entire position, thus winning the debate. Because of this, there is no other reason to really continue this debate, and you can vote con right now without even paying attention to the rest of the arguments in the following rounds.But overall, I urge a con vote.</t>

    <t>I must appologize to my opponent. He is misinterpreting how my case functions, and is thus still not sufficiently responding to my case. I'll spend a portion of my time here explaining how my case functions, and why his responses are not sufficient.The strucutre of a disadvantage, I will shorten to disad, come in four points (A - Uniqueness, B - Link, C - Internal Link, D - Impact). Each point serves a unique purpose in the case.A - Uniqueness: What things are happening in the real world that allow this case to apply to the resolution and to the aff/pro case. I make two independant points here: an increase in global population (Kates 1) and a decrease in the availability in water we can drink (Arlington Insitute 1/2). While he's covering the second point pretty well, he's just not adequetly covering the first point. If I am winning off of either point, Point A is to be given to con as I am giving a sufficient reason why this applies. So lets go to the arguments against Kates 1:His only main point is to point out that China and India's population are poised to fall. Fine. But the problem with this is my opponent is conceding three arguments I have made that inevitably screw over this argument:1. He's conceding the analyis under my link that says by giving people clean water to drink, we prevent deaths from things like dehydration and water pollution, thus increasing our population. This is logically true because if less people are dying, obviously there will be more people living, thus meaning a higher population. In so far as he has CONCEDED THIS ANALYSIS through all of the rounds so far, this alone is enough to take out this argument.2. He conceded the point I brought up that even if we were to adopt this policy on a world-wide scale, there would be no real way to enforce it adequetly. People could always just have babies behind their governments backs and then drop them off at a shelter for orphans or a place that will take care of them. He hasn't provided a way to enforce this policy, so this is enough to invalidate this argument.3. He conceded the point I brought up that says the only real way we COULD enforce this would be to either a) kill the illegally birthed baby, which is a MASSIVE rights violation, or b) severely punish the mother and father of the illegally birthed baby, which is another rights violation. In so far as the only way to enforce his policy causes more harm than it prevents, this point is refuted.So at this point, Kates 1 can be extended as a sufficient measure to fulfill point A. I don't even need to respond to the arguments against Arlington Institute 1 and 2, since they are independant from Kates 1, and either can fulfill the point A requirement.B - Links. Why my opponent's case links into the harms of the impact. I give two points here. 1: giving other people water reduces our supply of water, and 2: populations will increase because less people will be dying from things like water pollution and dehydration. Both can be logically confirmed. If I have two water bottles and I give somebody one of them, do I still have two water bottles? No, I only have one. So by giving water to other people, we lower the amount of water we have to give to other people. So this is logically true. The second link is also logically true, as I have already pointed out. So either way, my opponent still links into the harms of the impact, which is nuclear war. This was never really refuted, he only tried to point out why it doesn't apply. But I'm showing you exactly how it still applies, so he's still linking in.C - Internal Link. Why the link leads to the impact. This is the most crucial part of my case, and it is the part that has been ENTIRELY CONCEDED throughout this entire debate. This is where the Hance and Kates 2 cards come into play. Hance explains as our population rises, we push our resources further and further, and create a bubble. Once our population gets to large, we pop the metaphorical bubble and we arrive at Kates 2, which talks about once we reach a certain population (specifically 10 billion) people, the metaphorical crap will hit the fan and cause mass chaos. We will begin using our resources much faster than they can be replaced (through natural or artificial means) and things will begin to spiral out of control. This point has been entirely conceded throughout the entirety of the debate, so by affirming he's still leading things to the impact. In so far as he's conceded it for this long in the debate, don't let him start making new arguments against it once he realizes his mistake.D - Impact. This one is the most obvious one, it talks about what will happen and why it matters. This is where the Arlington Institute 3 and Klare cards come into play. As set up by Kates 2, we will begin to rapidly use up all of our natural resources once our population reaches a certain level. Once water, specifically stated in Arlington Institute 3, reaches a low, intrastate and international conflicts will begin to arise over the need for water. This need for water will push countries into nuclear war, as stated by Klare. Once nuclear war starts, massive amounts of death will consume the globe, and nuclear radiation will plunge the world into extinction. Again, this part of my case was ENTIRELY CONCEDED throughout the debate so far. In so far as it's gone conceded for this long in the debate, don't let him start making new arguments against it once he realizes his mistake.So this leads me to why the impact outweighs the pro's claims. I give two reasons for this: 1. By the pro trying to save people's lives by giving them clean water, they only cause them to die through nuclear war and nuclear radiation. So, the pro is effectively failing to prove his case true. 2. By advocating for a right to drinking water, they cause us to lose our right to life, which prevents us to even having a right to drinking water. If we're dead, we can't have water to begin with. So by affirming, he prevents us from having any rights.Then this case functions in two seperate ways, both of which are sufficient for a con vote. 1: It functions sufficiently as a reason on it's own to vote con, since I'm showing you exactly why we ought not value access to water as a human right. 2. It functions as a case turn to my opponent's case, since I'm showing you exactly how, by affirming, he prevents us from having rights in general, much less a right to drinking water. Since I'm sufficiently proving my side true, and my opponent is not doing enough work to disprove my case, I'm winning on both levels of the debate.So right now, we can easily call the debate an easy win for the con.</t>

    <t>I'd like to thank my opponent for two reasons: 1. For taking this debate and allowing me to practice with a case I haven't been able to run in person yet, and 2. For shooting himself not only in the foot, but in the head with the vast amount of concessions he made in his last round. Let's go through and point out what he conceded and what it means in terms of my case, his case, and the round.The first thing he concedes is the Kates card that says that population is growing. This is probably my opponent's worst mistake in the round. This concession implicates against him in a number of ways:1. With this concession, Point A can be extended out and confirmed as offense for me. This means that the link between points A and C still stands strong.2. With this concession, he concedes that in the aff world, the population is rising. This links him into the disad, outweighing his arguments against the link. So point B can also thusly be extended, thus still showing that the aff uniquely causes the impact.Again, he concedes Kates 1. I'm showing you how it implicates in the round and why this screws him over, don't let him stand up in his last round and read off new arguments against it because he already conceded it.Next thing that he concedes is the ENTIRE C point, which is Hance and Kates 2. This is going to be incredibly problematic for my opponent for a number of reasons:1. Hance shows the link between A and D, meaning once our population reaches a certain level, we enter a state of chaos that leads to Kates 2. 2. Since he concedes Kates 2, he's conceding the warrant coming out of Kates 2 that once we reach this population, we will consume water at a faster rate than it could be renewed. This pre-empts his desalinization argument because even if it's true, Kates 2 explains SPECIFICALLY how it will not be enough to sustain us. 3. Since he concedes Kates 2, it concedes the warrant saying that we will consume water faster than it could be replaced. This links STRAIGHT into water scarcity, meaning that if we affirm, we cause water scarcity. This outweighs the arguments against the first link, showing how he's still linking into the disad by affirming. He even goes as far as to ADMIT he conceded this by saying right under it 'Yes it is true that eventually the population will outgrow the supply of water'. HOLD HIM TO THIS CONCESSION.In so far as he's conceded ALL OF THIS EVIDENCE, practially HALF of the warrants in my case, he CAN'T win off of the disad. I'm showing you how the aff UNIQUELY causes the impact of nuclear war. He never made any argument as to why the neg causes this as well, only asserted it. I'm show you specifically how if we affirm, we cause nuclear war. My opponent has no evidence to back up his assertion. My impact still stands and it's the main reason why you're going to vote con. This also means that since the impact still stands, that the disad still functions as a case turn and take-out of my opponent's ENTIRE pro case. So he literally cannot gain any offense off of his case, as I'm showing you why HIS OWN CASE functions as a reason to vote con.At this point, I'd assume that my opponent's 'Oh sh*t' meter is going off in his head right now, once he realizes the gravity of his mistake. He's going to try and stand up in his last round of speaking and read off a massive amount of new reasons why what I'm saying is false and why he doesn't link and why he's not causing the impact. DO NOT LET HIM because a) he's conceding the warrants in my evidence that prove my case true and disproves his case and b) letting him list off a whole list of new arguments in the LAST ROUND of debate is highly abusive and unfair, since I have no ability to respond to it. So at this point, the debate breaks down pretty easily for the voters:1. I'm sufficiently showing why we ought not accept water as a human right, since doing so would cause nuclear war, thus fulfilling my resolution burden. First easy way to vote con.2. Since I'm proving my case true, my case effectively turns the entirety of my opponent's case by showing that by affirming, we not only lose our right to drinking water in the long run, but lose ALL of our rights, not to mention losing our lives. Thus, he can't get any offense off of his case, and he can't win off of it.In so far as he's conceded practically half of the warrants coming out of my case, I've shown you exactly why these two voters are true. Don't let him stand up and spend 8000 characters dumping new responses on my case, since that's highly abusive and unfair to me since I can't respond to them.So at this point, it's a clear win for the con.</t>

    <t>Before I begin I would like to thank Zaradi for starting this debate, and for allowing the maximum 8k character limit as I'm sure it will be necessary at points. Best of luck Zaradi :)  Resolved: Access to drinking water ought to be valued as a human right instead of a commodity.  As pro I will be arguing in support of the resolution and will begin using the following points:  P1: As a necessity for human survival access to drinking water should be ensured for all people. P2: To deny access to drinking water, regardless of reason is equivocal to murder, as without it, a person will die. P3: The feasibility of ensuring all are afforded access to clean drinking water, despite it being extremely difficult does not outweigh the previous two points.  P1: It is a scientific fact that human survival is dependant upon access to drinking water. It is essential for bodily functions. Why is it so important? 'Every cell, tissue and organ in your body needs water to function correctly[1].' Some important functions include maintaining temperature, removing waste, and lubricating joints. However as my previous quote showed, every part is dependent upon water. Indeed water makes up the majority of the parts of the body as well, 'Up to 60% of the human body is water, the brain is composed of 70% water, and the lungs are nearly 90% water. Lean muscle tissue contains about 75% water by weight, as is the brain; body fat contains 10% water and bone has 22% water. About 83% of our blood is water[2]...'  Indeed not having drinking water, even having drinking water but insufficient amounts has negative effects that are seen quickly, 'Dry mouth, the eyes stop making tears, sweating may stop, muscle cramps, nausea and vomiting, heart palpitations, lightheadedness (especially when standing), weakness, and decreased urine output. Also as thee body tries to maintain cardiac output (the amount of blood that is pumped by the heart to the body); and if the amount of fluid in the intravascular space is decreased, the body tries to compensate for this decrease by increasing the heart rate and making blood vessels constrict to try to maintain blood pressure and blood flow to the vital organs of the body. This coping mechanism begins to fail as the level of dehydration increases. With severe dehydration, confusion and weakness will occur as the brain and other body organs receive less blood. Finally, coma, organ failure, and death eventually will occur if the dehydration remains untreated.'  Indeed all these scientific reasons/effects lead nicely into proving my second point, to deny access to drinking water, regardless of reason is equivocal to murder, as without it, a person will die. To further prove my point I will ask the question, 'Does one have to be personally involved in a persons death to be at fault(wholly or partially)?' A reasoned point can be made that by making water a commodity instead of a right that we would all thusly become responsible for every death that results from lack of drinking water.  Lastly, my third point, that the feasibility of ensuring all are afforded drinking water does not outweigh my previous two points. As I am sure not even my peer wishes to be involved in another persons death, either directly or indirectly. As making water a commodity would be equivalent to sentencing those who are unable to afford water to death.  I look forward to my peers arguments. Again, best of luck Zaradi.</t>

    <t>Ill start out this round by thanking my peer for such a fine debate as I have thoroughly enjoyed myself. I will also say that throughout this round I will use different abbreviations that are as follows:  R- Reason D- Round S- Source  Now then, Here is a reason to vote affirmative.  R1- Due to the complete refutation of the Link in my peers disad argument, all conection to the affirmative position was lost, and therefore the disad as a whole is not a valid defense/offense within the context of the debate.  To explain, my peers whole argument is based on the pretext that upon taking the affirmative position, it will 1) Cause population growth 2) Population will grow to a point that the planet cannot sustain. 3)Thusly leading to a Nuclear War over resources.  To prove that the affirmative position causes population growth, thusly linking it to the disadvantage, he states, 'The affirmative claims that everyone ought to have access to water as per their human rights links in because a) it lowers our supply of water to give to other people and b) further causes the population to rise by increasing the quality of life.' This was part B of his argument, the link between my case and the disad. To successfuly refute his argument against the affirmative position one need only break the connection between it, and the con position(disad).  I have done this by refuting both parts of the link, this was necessary because even if one remains valid, the Link has not been sufficiently broken because it still connects my position to the disad. The refutations were:  A: Water can be reused/recycled so to say that by giving water to someone you reduce what can be given to another is false.(D2-S1)Water is not scarce therefore it makes no sense to even bring up this point.(D2-S1/D3-S2/D4-S1amp;2) As even if it were valid, which it is not, water being scarce is a prerequisite of why this point should even matter. B: An increase in quality of life(standard of living) does not equal population growth.(D3-S3)  Indeed my peer for some reason chose not to refute these, even though the Link is the most integral part of the disad within the context of the debate, and chose to focus instead of how i havent refuted other parts of his case. Before I continue I will point out that:  1) I need not refute every single part and the evidence used to support it for the case to be declared invalid within the context of the debate, just the link.(So as to reassure my peer that I am not creating new arguments here and just repeating or rephrasing what I have already said I'll quote) 'As such there is nothing to link the affirmative position to my peers disad argument.' 2) I conceded the evidence NOT the conclusions(Parts A, C, D of the disad) my peer drew from them. A subtle difference but one worth mentioning, as even though the evidence is true it does nothing to support his case so long as the link is invalid. In fact it works against his case too, as population will rise in the pro and con world. As such the impact is not valid as well, given it will occur in both worlds.  Due to my refutation of the link, thus negating the entire disadvantage, my case still stands as the strongest, as there has not been a sufficient defense mounted against it. As such the vote must go pro.  P.S.- This debate really should go to con for these reasons:  R1) Without his assistance in the comments i would not have come to these conclusions. My moral compass cannot allow me to claim victory given this factor. R2) I have misused terminology throughout the entire debate and thusly debased my whole refutation as nonsense, and unintelligable. R3) My peer was not afforded sufficient time to respond to my refutations as to do so he would have had to make new arguments as to why my position still links into the disad as a whole.</t>

    <t>1) First of all, the USA is not a democracy, it is a Republic meaning we have rule by representatives. The majority does NOT rule. The popular vote isn't even the deciding factor in presidential elections so that statement is absolutely false. Let me clarify: the concept of global warming as a man driven catastrophic phenomena is not wildly accepted. Also, since most Americans find the concept to be exaggerated means it is likely that they would be less receptive to a tax increase to combat something not an immediate danger. In 2010 only 28% of people said global warming was a 'top priority' [1]By 2011, global warming didn't even make the polling list. [2] Out of all the public priority polls referenced in the source global warming isn't specifically mentioned even once. Right now the economy dominates the public priority and higher taxes on airline flights falls under the economy and would be damaging, therefore would be extremely unpopular. 2) You're saying to replace reasonable flight distance with train rides. By your own rough calculations (which aren't sourced by the way so I shouldn't even be addressing it, you also broke your own rules here) train takes 3x longer than airline flights. Now, as I pointed out before in my previous argument, an argument you dropped I might add, sometimes flights are needed for immediate travel and this demand will never go away. Many people don't have three days to leisurely travel by train. People have deadlines, need to get back to school, back to work etc. In today's world scrapping flight for a three day train ride makes no logistical sense. 3)The United States' Interstate System is the largest highway system in the world and since the mid 20th century the car has dominated American travel. [3] Transport by train has diminished to almost nothing save for subway travel in a few key cities. Long distance train travel only has 'a few trains a day' [3]. Train travel is cumbersome, slow, non-personal (meaning you can't stop for McDonald's when you want) and inefficient. For train travel to work in the US there would have to be a major rehaul of the transportation system including the addition of high speed rail. But Americans are unresponsive to the idea. The state of Florida proposed a high speed rail between Orlando and Tampa but was popularly vetoed by the governor. [4] It was unanimous within the state government. 4) Math for my ClaimI did a calculation, a simple flight from Jacksonville, FL to Houston, TX for a total distance of 2,632 km. According to this emissions calculator this flight will produce 282.67 Kg of CO2 for one single person. [5] Now, this source says the ideal car emissions would be 120g CO2/km. [6] Since we don't all drive the ideal car I bumped it up reasonably to 200g CO2/km which is reasonable. Now if we do the math. 200g * 2,632km = 526.4 kg CO2. 526gt;282As we can see driving increases CO2 emissions per person. Even if we use the 'ideal benchmark for car emissions' of 120g/km we get this:120g * 2,632km = 315 kg CO2. 315gt;282Now, if we go back to the original number both 526kg and 315kg are larger than 282kg. If we multiply this out by 250 we see the difference grow larger and larger so that the ecological impact of 250 people driving this average flight distance of 2600km is vastly more drastic than one flight. Also, if you see this graphic --gt; [7] you can see that aviation only accounts for 2% of CO2 emissions opposed to the 25% by 'Transportation' which is mostly cars. Even if we bump that 25% down to say 10% (highly unlikely, the majority of that 25 is car emissions) it is still vastly higher than 2% attributed to aviation emission. Cars are simply dirtier for the environment. 5) Like I said in my last argument: people need to fly.Very few people needlessly fly. Flying is essential to a lot of functions of our economy. Businessmen travel a lot and to conduct business and attend business meetings they are required to fly. A father who is on leave from the military and wants to see his family will usually fly from his place of duty. Families traveling to funerals in other states or areas of the country will have to fly to save time and make deadlines. Flying is essential and taxing it more will not reduce demand because people really only fly if they have to. Instead of reducing demand all you will do is put strain on the economy. People who would have a little extra money in their pocket to buy a book or magazine or cool gizmo will now be gone. Savings will be drawn upon to pay the extra price for air tickets. You will be damaging the economy. The price of goods and services will rise because businesses will have to pay more for goods to be shipped and for their business agents to travel. The economy would suffer a huge blow in a similar way that a rise in the price of gas effects it. Reread my argument, you did very little to refute it. The demand for flying in today's world can only go down so much. The rest of the people that need to fly will feel the strain of unneeded financial burden. </t>

    <t>'Changing something in favor o something that isn't wildly accepted is ridiculous. 'Thing is, most Americans (1), 85% to be precise, do beleive that global warming is real. The USA is a democratic country, which means that the majority rule- therefore initiating something due to global warming is not, as you say, 'ridiculous'. Although slightly lower in the UK, (83% beleive in global warming) (2), it is still a majority- and the UK is also a democracy. Just because Americans may think climate change is exagurated, by no means do they beleive it isn't real and that they don't accept it as a concept!So yes, changing something in favour of something which isn't widely accept is unneccesary, thing is- global warming is widely accepted!'Raising Taxes on Airlines Would Push People to Drive 'Yes- if they were flying a driving distance. Assuming that all flights could be replaced by a car drive is ridiculous! What if I wanted to fly from the UK to China, or from Cape Town to Egypt? Although theoretically these flights could be make by car, it would take weeks and people don't have that kind of time! Yes, trains do take longer than flights- but this is just a small sacrifice we need to make. Besides, it doesn't take that much longer! A train from London to Austria takes about 3 days on train and one day on the plane. I'm not saying that trains are the most convenient form of transport out there, but for too long people have been doing what is most convenient, and look what's happening to our planet.'no one is going to take a train instead of flying they would instead turn to the most widely used source of travel in the United States: the car.'Yeah... because when opposed with a car which you have to drive yourself for several weeks and pay seriously high petrol rates for, a faster, cheaper transport which they don't have to drive themselves would NEVER be picked! Please think through these things more carefully, and a survey or poll would be much better than empty opinions about which form of transport people would take. Mine logically makes sense as it is cheaper, faster and less tiring.'According to two sources there are roughly 90,000 flights a day [2] [3] while there are 254 million passanger vehical'' If all 250 or so passangers per flight go back to their cars you haven't done anything to reduce pollution.'You've broken the rule which says all stats and facts must be sourced. If you can show me a calculation that shows me that 250 people travelling by car is more or equally polluting than 250 people travelling by plane, I'd be happy to accept your argument. Until then, your argument is invalid.'By implementing your tax plan people will not only continue to damage your precious environment'See my response to your last quote.'The price of goods and services will rise because businesses will have to pay more for goods to be shipped and for their business agents to travel. 'I apologize for not stating at the beginning, but this debate is about people flying and not flying goods over. Of course you can still argue your 'goods need to be flown' theory as I didn't state this in the acceptance round. I'm not attempting to introduce this as a new rule, just explaining why I'm not rebutting this.'The demand for flying would not really go down because flying is so essential and instead the economy would be damaged for no reason'It is true that flying is sometimes neccesary and cannot be fully replaced, but putting a tax on it will make people consider whether they really need it or not! If they really need it, they should pay the extra price. If they don't want to cough up, they don't need it that much and therefore that flight wasn't that neccesary in the first place.</t>

    <t>First of all I would like to point out that human caused global warming is not an established fact but is merely an idea accpeted by some scientists in the scientific community. So your argument is based around an idea that is not globally accepted nor is it even majority accepted and has been challenged continuously. [1] Why would we raise taxes and change the status quo in favor of something that is not accepted by many people? Half of all Americans think that global warming is exaggerated. [6] Changing something in favor o something that isn't wildly accepted is ridiculous. Can you name one modern species pushed to extinction by 'global warming'?That being said...Raising Taxes on Airlines Would Push People to Drive  You think that raising taxes on the airlines would cause people to ride 'trains' instead or think about flying. This premise is laughable firstly because no one is going to take a train instead of flying they would instead turn to the most widely used source of travel in the United States: the car. According to two sources there are roughly 90,000 flights a day [2] [3]  while there are 254 million passanger vehicals in the United States [4]. These passangers who would choose not to fly would merely go back to driving. If all 250 or so passangers per flight go back to their cars you haven't done anything to reduce pollution. Also; airline travel is the safest form of travel [5] and forcing people out of the planes and into cars will increase the risk of accident and injury due to car crashes. By implementing your tax plan people will not only continue to damage your precious environment but you will be endangering the people as well with increased risk of car accident.People Need to FlyFlying is essential to a lot of functions of our economy. Businessmen travel a lot and to conduct business and attend business meetings they are required to fly. A father who is on leave from the military and wants to see his family will usually fly from his place of duty.

The economy would suffer a huge blow in a similar way that a rise in the price of gas effects it. In conclusion:- Global warming is not universally accepted and changing such massive things as the price of airline tickets for something not wholly accepted as truth is ludicrous- A tax on flying will only lead to an increase in driving which is just as dirty and more dangerous than flying- The demand for flying would not really go down because flying is so essential and instead the economy would be damaged for no reasonTherefore the tax on air travel should not be touched.</t>

    <t>Thank-you.  My first point is that air travel is a major contributor towards global warming and climate change. The emmission contains extremely harmful gases which damage our ozone layer. (3)As much as we can turn off our lights when we leave the room, or always recycle our cans, it is basically all cancelled out by air travel. This article shows some major reasons why we need to help slow down global warming and the effects it is having on our environment. (1) This article shows that, among other things, global warming and climate change is also responsible for a huge amount of species becoming extinct (2) Air travel massively contributes towards climate change, therefore also contributing towards the extinction of species and the destruction of our environment. Should the human race really put the ecological balance of the earth on the brink, just so we can have some quick travel?  My second point, is that having a higher tax on air line tickets will make people stop and think whether they really want to fly. As they becoming increasingly cheap, people buy them usually without weighing out other options such as taking the train. Taxing them higher will encourage people to look at other options which have a lower tax on our environment (no pun intended).  I look forward to your arguments. </t>

<h>You're not winning that easily! Sorry I missed the last round, but I'm still going to fight to win this debate.' but may I ask why do we need them?'So you're asking why we need to protect cities against tidal waves? Okay.. tidal waves damage houses, buildings, vegetation and roads. Look at this image: As you can see, there was a lot of destruction caused, which could have been reduced by sea walls.' 'we' need them because some people want to invest in a expensive house that will ineffably be destroyed by the waves. Like I said some people are lacking common sense when the build/buy along the beach/beaches cliff.'Some clarification would be great. I don't see how people who buy houses on the coast are lacking common sense, as with the installation of sea walls they won't be washed away. ' people want to invest in a expensive house that will ineffably be destroyed by the waves.'Seems like you're arguing my side of the debate here... 'we use roads every day, they are a MUCH NEEDED commute system, houses, they are more NEEDED than sea walls' It seems like you haven't understood my point. What I was saying was that even though sea walls are expensive, it is worth it because the cost of repairing roads should a tidal wave occur, is higher. It's like, if someone was going to steal your $1000 car and an alarm system cost $90, it would be illogical to say that getting the alarm system was too costly. I agree that roads are very much needed, which is why we should treasure them and protect them with sea walls.In no way did I state or believe that sea walls should priorotise above roads though. 'once again a sea wall in NOT going to protect against a tsunami!'Agreed.... care to quote a part of my argument that says that the will? I just stated that they would reduce the impact, not stop them completely. ' but, do you really think that sea walls are going protect us from tsunamis?'No I don't.  Check  my response to your previous quote ^.'No they truly don't 'reduce' anything except the budget of the home owners and govt.'.... Reduce the budget of homeowners? How so? Also, like I sad: there is an increasingly huge chance that a tidal wave will occur due to climate change, and if anything will reduce the government's budget it's going to be repairing all that damage! Sea walls are relatively cheap, compared to repairing houses, roads and conpensating families.Also, you didn't really rebut my point about beach traffic, so I guess I've won that clash point!I look forward to your response.</h>

    <t>The Pros and Cons of Sea walls  Cons: Pros: Expensive to build  Absorbs impact of the waves Over time the wall will erode Visually unattractive  Protects the land close to the ocean Costly to maintain Can be expensive to obtain and transport (Overall it's a cost problem)  Now this debate is both a problem of people who live on the coast and people such as environmentalists, tourists who go to our beaches, ect.  Now for the people who buy houses along the beach I believe that they lack in the common sense department. They practically WASTE their money on buying a extremely expensive house along the beach/along cliffs when inevitably the sea walls will erode, or a huge wave might come slamming down on their homes.. Sea walls do not protect against tsunamis, or anything of that nature.  Sea walls are a type of coastal management here are other types of coastal management: Groynes: Are wooden barriers that are built at a right angle to the beach. This absorbs energy which reduces cliff erosion (only one that's not that costly)  Sea Walls: Are walls that are built along the front of cliffs, the often protect land (homes stores ect.). This can cause the erosion of the material at the base of the wall.  Revetments: Wooden barriers built towards the rear of the beaches to protect the base of the cliffs  Rock armor/boulder barriers: Placed along the base of a cliff to absorb energy from waves.  Gabsions: Where rocks and boulders are surrounded in this type of mesh and absorbs the energy from the waves  Off-shore breakwater: Large concrete blocks and boulders located off shore and are use to change the direction of the waves  But will be only debating about sea walls not th other types of coastal management.</t>

    <t>You're not winning that easily! Sorry I missed the last round, but I'm still going to fight to win this debate.' but may I ask why do we need them?'So you're asking why we need to protect cities against tidal waves? Okay.. tidal waves damage houses, buildings, vegetation and roads. Look at this image: As you can see, there was a lot of destruction caused, which could have been reduced by sea walls.' 'we' need them because some people want to invest in a expensive house that will ineffably be destroyed by the waves. Like I said some people are lacking common sense when the build/buy along the beach/beaches cliff.'Some clarification would be great. I don't see how people who buy houses on the coast are lacking common sense, as with the installation of sea walls they won't be washed away. ' people want to invest in a expensive house that will ineffably be destroyed by the waves.'Seems like you're arguing my side of the debate here... 'we use roads every day, they are a MUCH NEEDED commute system, houses, they are more NEEDED than sea walls' It seems like you haven't understood my point. What I was saying was that even though sea walls are expensive, it is worth it because the cost of repairing roads should a tidal wave occur, is higher. It's like, if someone was going to steal your $1000 car and an alarm system cost $90, it would be illogical to say that getting the alarm system was too costly. I agree that roads are very much needed, which is why we should treasure them and protect them with sea walls.In no way did I state or believe that sea walls should priorotise above roads though. 'once again a sea wall in NOT going to protect against a tsunami!'Agreed.... care to quote a part of my argument that says that the will? I just stated that they would reduce the impact, not stop them completely. ' but, do you really think that sea walls are going protect us from tsunamis?'No I don't.  Check  my response to your previous quote ^.'No they truly don't 'reduce' anything except the budget of the home owners and govt.'.... Reduce the budget of homeowners? How so? Also, like I sad: there is an increasingly huge chance that a tidal wave will occur due to climate change, and if anything will reduce the government's budget it's going to be repairing all that damage! Sea walls are relatively cheap, compared to repairing houses, roads and conpensating families.Also, you didn't really rebut my point about beach traffic, so I guess I've won that clash point!I look forward to your response.</t>

    <t>Rebuttal: 'Over time the wall will erode' Just because something isn't permanent doesn't mean it's not worth installing. Even though hillside forestation isn't permanent, it is still done because it is an effective way to stop avalanches, in the way that sea walls are effective at reducing the impact of tidal waves and tsunamis.  'Costly to maintain' It is even more costly to repair roads, houses, office blocks and compensate families if a tsunami or tidal wave damages a town or part of a city.  'Now this debate is both a problem of people who live on the coast and people such as environmentalists,' Sea walls will reduce busy traffic on beaches, therefore allowing wildlife such as turtles and endangered species in rock pools to thrive.  'Sea walls do not protect against tsunamis, or anything of that nature.' Sea walls do protect against small tidal waves, that is the whole point of them! It also reduces the impact of tsunamis and larger tidal waves, even if they don't toally stop them (1) There have been numerous accounts of towns being protected from tidal waves by sea walls.  With climate change becoming increasingly dangerous, the chance of tidal waves and tsunamis occurring are significantly higher. Sea walls are an investment in our future!</t>

    <t>I believe that this He3 material would not be worth a colonization because if it simply slows cancer all your doing is buying them time for their unstoppable death so why would people buy it to make their lives a bit longer.  Also China and India are no threat to the United States military don't get me wrong the Chinese are strong but the United States has better infantry and commanders Chinese infantry would not stand up to a Marine or Navy Seal or a West point graduate, and India has a no recorded historical of any invasion of another country proving American military might is most likely superior to the Indian forces. As history shows it dose not matter how great your technology and society is if the other guy kills you or at least beats you down. Second China is overflowing with people to the point were they are limiting how many kids they can have which is hurting their farming communities they are to busy juggling their own problems to be a super power.  As for over population the UN believes that the earth could hold another three billion people before it peaks.  I also don't believe the moon could be a stepping stone to mars because I don't believe that we would even be able to build a major city on the moon given the fact that asteroid's are constantly smacking into it and humanity has very little experience with space travel trying to build a nasa base on a unstable piece of land would be very risky.</t>

    <t>I cut and pasted a couple of passages from the NCPA website because I didn't want to write all the evidence in my head.  Current research suggests that coastal stations in Greenland are experiencing a cooling trend, and average summer air temperatures at the summit of the Greenland Ice Sheet have decreased at the rate of 4°F per decade since measurements began in 1987.   Is Warming Causing Sea Ice to Melt? According to the Arctic Assessment , human-caused warming in the Arctic will necessarily lead to decreased sea ice thickness and extent. However, air temperature is only one factor that influences sea ice; the frequency and velocity of the wind also has an effect. When the Arctic is relatively calm, it is easier for sea ice to develop. During stormy periods, surface winds churn the water and move existing ice, making it more difficult for sea ice to form.   A study commissioned by Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans examined the relationship between air temperature and sea ice and concluded, "the possible impact of global warming appears to play a minor role in changes to Arctic sea ice." Rather, the Canadian study found that changing wind patterns are the primary cause of changing sea ice distributions. Moreover, while sea ice has decreased in the Arctic, it has remained relatively constant (or even increased slightly) in the Antarctic since 1978.  Is Global Warming Killing Polar Bears? The Arctic Assessment concludes, "global warming could cause polar bears to go extinct by the end of the century by eroding the sea ice that sustains them." According to the assessment, the threat to polar bears is threefold: Changes in rainfall or snowfall amounts or patterns could affect the ability of seals, the bears' primary prey, to successfully reproduce and raise their pups; decreased sea ice could result in a greater number of polar bears drowning or living more on land, negatively affecting their diet (forcing them to rely on their fat stores prior to hibernation); and unusual warm spells could cause the collapse of winter dens or force more bears into less-desirable denning areas.   Though polar bears are uniquely adapted to the Arctic region, they are not wedded solely to its coldest parts nor are they restricted to a specific Arctic diet. Aside from a variety of seals, they eat fish, kelp, caribou, ducks, sea birds and scavenged whale and walrus carcasses. In addition, as discussed above, Arctic air temperatures were as high as present temperatures in the 1930s and polar bears survived.   Moreover, when the WWF report is compared with the Arctic air temperature trend studies discussed earlier, there is a strong positive (instead of negative) correlation between air temperature and polar bear populations. Polar bear populations are declining in regions (like Baffin Bay) that have experienced a decrease in air temperature, while areas where polar bear populations are increasing (near the Bering Strait and the Chukchi Sea) are associated with increasing air temperatures. Thus it is difficult to argue that rising air temperatures will necessarily and directly lead to a decrease in polar bear populations.</t>
