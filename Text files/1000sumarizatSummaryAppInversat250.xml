    <t>There is so much on this issue I don't know what to explain first.  Fact 1: There has been no significant atmospheric warming since 1998. In addition to this, there has been a lack of an atmospheric hotspot (in the mid to upper troposphere) that was predicted to be caused by greenhouse gas caused warming. This in itself proves that greenhouse gasses are not causing the recent warming trend. No warming 1: No warming 2: Lack of hotspot 1: Lack of hotspot 2: (Specifically on pg 6 but I suggest you read more)  Fact 2: Co2 is an extraordinarily weak greenhouse gas. According to atomic absorption spectroscopy, it can only store and release 7% of the electromagnetic spectrum that passes through it.  Fact 3: Throughout Earths history, Co2 has been much higher in the past showing that recent levels of Co2 are harmless. Fact 4: Recently, ice core data shows that Co2 followed temperature, sometimes by hundreds of years, not the other way around. Lags warming 1: Lags warming 2: Fact 5: Co2 has never caused amplification of warming in the past. It is simple logic. If Co2 amplified temperature after orbital changes raised the temperature first, when would the amplification stop? The answer is when there is no more Co2 in the oceans. This would cause the oceans to become abnormally basic and this has only happened once in the last 25 million years: Ocean pH 25 million years:(I know it shows acidification at the end but this does not contradict my argument because it is a different result of more Co2.)  Fact 6: Almost every single computer model made by the IPCC is wrong. This suggests something fundamentally wrong with the models used. In addition, the models are all wrong because they predict to much heat which suggests that the effect of Co2 is being overblown. Computer models wrong 1: Computer models wrong 2: Fact 7: The Earth has been warming for 15000 years. Warming for 15000 (or 20000 it depends on the data) years:  Fact 8: In the last 8000 years, we have had 4 major global warm periods naturally. We had the medieval warm period, the roman warm period, the Minoan warm period and the Holocene maximum. All major warm periods: Medieval warm period was global 1:  Medieval warm period was global 2:  Fact 9: All major planet bodies in our solar system are experiencing rapid climate change, indicating that the heating on Earth could be caused by something in the solar system, not the planet.  Mars: Ice caps are shrinking, two pictures showed possible warming (these could be unreliable due to dust storms), atmosphere is gaining clouds, ozone and water vapor (indicating warming).  Pluto: Mysterious dark spots are becoming larger, atmospheric pressure increased by 300% (indicating warming)  Saturn: Giving off x-rays, growing storm spots and other hot spots in its atmosphere (indicating warming)  Uranus: Polar shifts, 2 large storms spots that were not there 50 years ago (indicating warming)  Mercury: Gaining a magnetic field, polar ice caps growing (indicating cooling)  Jupiter: Plasma clouds merging together and growing new storm spots (indicating an 18 degree Celsius warming)  Venus: 2500% increase in green glow indicating more oxygen in its atmosphere  Neptune: Weird changes in light intensity.  Earth: Rapid warming  As you can see, every major planet in our solar system is experiencing rapid climate change. Scientists theorize that this is due to increased amounts of energy in the space around our solar system.  Fact 10: There is no scientific way to test whether Co2 causes global warming. Yes, Co2 is a greenhouse gas and traps warmth, I am not denying that. What we haven't tested is whether this warmth has a great enough impact to trump all other factors that influence climate. For example, ocean currents, cosmic rays, sun irradiance, the sun spot cycle, Earth's magnetic field, Earth's orbit, Earth's tilt, Volcanos, etc' all effect the climate. Why is Co2 more important than all of these factors? Let's find out! Oh, wait, you can't. This is where you reach a problem. How do you find out? You can't, scientifically, create a real, controlled experiment to test whether Co2 has a bigger impact than any of these other factors. This means that the entire idea that Co2 causes climate change is based on computer models and it can't actually be tested. This shows that the idea that Co2 causes warming is less science then it is religion because you are putting your faith in a computer model rather than observing and recording data. Keep in mind that simple correlations do not qualify as scientific data.  Fact 11: During the post economic boom, when Co2 soared, temperatures fell despite the increase in Co2. This has been blamed on increased sulfur emissions but NASA says, 'the cooling effect of the pollution aerosols will be somewhat regionally dependent, near and downwind of industrial areas' which explains how sulfur would only cause cooling in or around the areas it was released. This means that sulfur could not be responsible for the cooling. Post war economic boom: Co2 levels. As you can see, Co2 levels rose dramatically during the post economic boom, past what they had ever been at before, yet temperatures fell.  In conclusion, I have provided 11 facts explaining how Co2 can not, or has never been, a main climate driver. All the historical and recent evidence is stacked against it. While my opponent gives links to a consensus and impacts of possible warming, I have focused on the argument at hand. Explaining why Co2 does not drive climate. While my opponent has made little to no argument, I have shown why the conclusions of the scientists in the consensus he listed were wrong. I thank my opponent for this debate, and may the best man/woman win!</t>

    <t>First my opponent says that I should have asked questions about the structure earlier in the debate but ignores the fact that, in the comment section, I did ask about the order of the debate and explain what I thought it meant. Therefore, I did alert my opponent to my confusion and my opponent either chose to ignore it or did not see it but either way I made my confusion known. Therefore, my opponent did break their own rules.  My opponent then says, 'if you are so sure you are correct and there are so many climate change deniers, why don't you publish your r2-3 arguments in a peer reviewed journal?' My response to this is that: 1. There are not many climate change skeptics. This is because people choose not to be skeptical because believing in man made global warming is how you get grants. 2. I don't publish my findings in a peer reviewed journal because they would not get published. This is because the people who choose what to publish in the journals most likely believe in man made global warming and are therefore biased against me. Another reason a journal would not publish a skeptical article about man made global warming is that if they did, then they would be accused of being funded by fossil fuel companies and would be ridiculed. Other scientists have already tried to publish their findings and it is always rejected so why should I try? What people don't realize is that by attacking anyone who has a skeptical view of man made climate change you are preventing research into that area and therefore creating a huge bias in the experiments done and articles published.  In conclusion, my opponent has not rebutted even one of my claims, instead they focus on the accusations of rule breaking. Due to this absence of rebuttals, my arguments stand and therefore, based on this debate, I have proven how climate change is not much of a threat, and that global warming is not caused by man. While my opponent may of used abstracts from peer reviewed articles (as they love pointing out) I have won the debate. I have given 11 points to why climate change is not due to Co2 and given countless examples of natural disaster frequency staying constant. All of the arguments I have made in this debate go uncontested and therefore prove that climate change is not man made and that the threat is exaggerated. Due to this, all voters are mandated to vote Con under more convincing arguments and conduct.  Thank you for reading this debate.</t>

    <t>My opponent throws around a bunch of irrelevant facts to try to disprove highly credible and peer reviewed articles. At this point, responding to my opponent's arguments directly would only give the impression that they were worth responding to. I added a few more peer reviewed articles to back up my points. I use peer reviewed to prove that anthropic climate change is real and a threat. When two sides of the debate conflict on facts, the winner goes to the side who uses the more credible sources. My opponent uses blogs and other sources with notorious reputations. Then, my opponent proceeds to engage in conjecture that these red herrings somehow impact the resolution. At the very least voters, give me the more credible sources points. The below quote, although lengthy explains that man-made climate change isn't something far in the future, its an event that has occurred already and is continuing to occur and claim human lives. I have overwhelmingly met my burden of proof. Thanks for the debate. ''Unusually high temperatures, as well as socioeconomic vulnerability, along with social attenuation of hazards, in a general context where the anthropogenic contribution to climate change is becoming more plausible, led to an excess of 14,947 deaths in France, between August 4 and 18, 2003. The greatest increase in mortality was due to causes directly attributable to heat: dehydration, hyperthermia, heat stroke. In addition to age and gender, combinatorial factors included preexisting disease, medication, urban residence, isolation, poverty, and, probably, air pollution. Although diversely impacted or reported, many parts of Europe suffered human and other losses, such as farming and forestry through drought and fires. Summer 2003 was the hottest in Europe since 1500, very likely due in part to anthropogenic climate change.''</t>

    <t>My opponent breaks their own rules by not rebutting my argument. Therefore it is an automatic win for the Con as my opponent can decide when they want to break the rules or not, leaving me at an unfair disadvantage. Instead of following their own rules and rebutting my claims, my opponent decides to strengthen their argument. This creates an automatic win condition for the Con.  Rebuttals: Strong hurricane numbers have stayed almost constant since 1880: Tornado numbers have stayed constant since 1950 in the U.S. Drought frequency seems to have stayed constant for almost 50 years. Sea levels are not rising due to heat because the Argo Buoy System data shows that the ocean has not warmed since we started measuring (2003) This shows that the sea only seems to be rising because of tectonic plate movement and the supposed rise is only due to a natural cycle. Antarctic ice extent has reached record levels in 2012, 2013 and 2014. This has been blamed on increased precipitation causing more snowfall but if this is true then how come the same thing isn't happening in the Arctic? If this were true, then Arctic ice would be growing too.  It is true that heat wave frequency has increased but other natural disaster frequencies have stayed constant proving that the climate change threat is either nonexistent or being exaggerated.  In conclusion, while I agree that rapid climate change poses a threat, I believe that this threat is being exaggerated and that humanity does not have to worry about extreme heat or any other natural disaster for much longer because once the world enters a natural cooling period all of this will be forgotten.</t>

    <t>Hello, loyal comrades.  As a devout socialist (coughs and splutters- apparently the word communist is illegal nowadays) I can confirm that the idea of an environment is a plot to destroy the capitalist infidels of the west, the idea is to push their focus so far into ideas of global warming and the environment that they will not see the coming revolution. Before they know it, the means of production will have been seized and the bourgeoise crippled.  The master plan for the environmental decoy was first formed by loyal soviet Leonid Kzyladskystok, who's idea was taken by Comrade Stalin, and it's creator purged. The mighty Stalin then locked the idea away in a secret KGB chamber for later use. It was discovered years later, after the 'fall' of the mighty Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, by loyal communist Hai Chi Zendog, who took the proposition to Xingping of China, who put the idea into action.  In more depth, the plot is to pull the focus of weak, populist politicians such as Barack Obama to the issues of global warming, and how to prevent it, while secretly building up a force to crush the bourgeoise and initiate the revolution. Machines of war, such as tanks and planes, will be cut down due to their 'environmental cost' by the U.S. and other western infidels, while the loyal socialists in the east grow in strength for the revolution.  Movements such as that of the infidel Donald J Trump have threatened to destroy the plot, so the spy Bernie Sanders was placed to win the presidency and continue to disillusion Americans and other westerners with the Global warming lie, in order to weaken the Bourgeoise for the upcoming revolution.  So there you have it, capitalist pigs, from an insider. The idea of an environment is actually a socialist plot to initiate the revolution and destroy capitalism.  Your loyal Comrade, Harry</t>

    <t>I would say the idea of the environment started with Charles Darwin in 1859. 'The theory of evolution by natural selection, first formulated in Darwin's book 'On the Origin of Species' in 1859, is the process by which organisms change over time as a result of changes in heritable physical or behavioral traits. Changes that allow an organism to better adapt to its environment will help it survive and have more offspring. ' [1]'In 1848, Marx and fellow German thinker Friedrich Engels published “The Communist Manifesto,” which introduced their concept of socialism as a natural result of the conflicts inherent in the capitalist system.' [2]As you can see the idea of the environment came out after the idea of Karl Marx in 1848. So this idea isn't completely impossible. If the idea of the environment came before Marx was born I could show this as impossible. Instead, I will show how unlikely this idea that the environment is a socialist plot. Now Karl Marx and Darwin had contact, again I can't show impossible, but can show improbable. 'Letter from Charles Darwin to Karl MarxOctober, 1873' [3]As you can see Marx and Darwin did not have contact until 1873 which was well after the idea of the environment was developed. Of course it is possible that Marx influenced Darwin to create the theory of evolution as a socialist plot to destroy capitalism, yet I find this absurdly improbable. </t>

    <t>OutlineI. IntroII. CorrelationIII. Confounding factorsIV. Reverse causalityV. Likely a threatVI. Man made VII. ConclusionVIII. SourcesI. Intro Brief intro, I created this debate before, and expected an easy win. I was completely blind sided by my opponent's arguments and it was too late in the debate to recover. Basically, I ended up with a tangled mess and decided the best move was to give up and make a fresh start. Feel free to make the same arguments if you debated me before. Burden of proof, I need to prove three objectives to win. Burden of proof should be 99% Pro and 1% con on all three objectivesII. CorrelationTo prove causation I first need to prove correlation, which is easy enough. Insert picture here. [0] It is well known that carbon is increasing in parts per million. Now at 404.48 ppm III. Confounding factorsThe second problem is confounding factors. Mostly some solar event that affects the entire solar system. Since only a few planets and moons are warming it is safe to assume there are no confounding factors with enough impact to be relevant. [2][3]To restate, surely there are negligible confounding factors that are irrelevant.IV. Reverse causalityNow the only part that is left for the first part of the burden of proof is causality. Co2 and global temperature have a two way causality relationship. Meaning as the oceans heat, Co2 is released which in turns heats up the ocean more. For example, when exiting an ice age first the Earth tilts raising temperature. [4]The temperature increase causes the oceans to release Co2 which is a green house gas. The green house gas in turn increase the ocean's temperatures. Therefore, it is safe to say that Co2 causes global climate change. Readers should now be at least 99% sure that Co2 causes global climate change and warming.V. Likely a threatNow, to prove that the climate change we are experiencing regardless of the cause is a threat, we need a correlation when temperatures suddenly changed. Using the Antarctica ice, we can look at Co2 and temperatures back millions of years. Whenever we see a sudden spike in temperature mass extinctions occur.Mass extinction are a threat to the human race. In fact mass extinctions are occurring right now. Therefore, I have proven then sudden temperature changes, including the one we are experiencing at this moment are correlated with mass extinctions which we are experiencing now. There is also many political problems and threats that come with global climate change. [5] Bill Nye thinks IS (Islamic State) is linked with climate change. Farmers are abandoing their lands due to water shortfalls and becoming terrorists. Therefore, the Paris attacks were caused in part by global climate change.[6] I have fufilled my burden of proof that there is a 99% chance that climate change is a threat.VI. Man madeNow the most difficult part, to prove the changes are man-made. Many climate change deniers will agree with the first two parts and strongly disagree with the third. I need to prove there is at least a 99% chance that man made climate change is real. First, man made Co2 is only a small portion of the Co2 generated. The problem is two fold, first humans are destroying Co2 sinks including forests. Via human made deforestation we are removing much of our Co2 buffer. Second, we are producing Co2 via burning of fossil fuels. Unlike naturally occurring Co2 this is not cycled. Another way of explaining is that non-human Co2 is balanced out by naturally occurring events. Despite being small, made-made Co2 is upsetting the balance of nature. Yet, the question remains, how do we know its not natural? Remember the oceans releasing Co2. Well if this was a natural event the increase in Co2 would come from the oceans. To disprove this is not a natural event we can simply look at the Co2 and acidity of the oceans. The oceans are gaining in Co2 not losing. Meaning this is not a natural event that raises temperature and the Co2 is released from the oceans. Instead, the oceans are absorbing more Co2 then losing. [7] I have met my burden of proof that there is at least a 99% chance that global climate change is man made. VII. ConclusionJust in case you needed more evidence here is some easily observable evidence including glaciers. [8] I have fulfilled my burden of proof, 99% that climate change is real and a threat. Man made global climate change is real and is a threat. Thanks for the debate. </t>

    <t>The problem with your argument is humans have been wrong with a lot of ideas. I find most of your argument fits under the ad populum fallacy. [2] Just because the majority of scientists think man made climate change is real and a threat, does not mean the scientists are correct. At one time we thought the Earth was flat and the sun revolved around the Earth. ' 'Does the Earth go around the Sun, or does the Sun go around the Earth?'If you answered the latter, you're among a quarter of Americans who also got it wrong, according to a new report by the National Science Foundation. ' [3]There is a chance that the entire global warming/climate change is a scam. That the deniers are whistle blowers. If we start jailing whistle blowers we could be in a lot of trouble. [4] Remember that 97% of climate change scientists agree. That means 3% don't, those 3% could be legitimate whistle blowers. Some of the scientist claim there is bullying going on to reach the consensuses. [5] There is talk of data manipulation. [6] Honestly, I will not stoop by backing up the deniers. I think the chances of the deniers being wrong is at least 99%. Nevertheless, there is that 1% chance. More importantly, it sets a precedence as seen in r1.Finally, and perhaps my strongest argument.

    <t>My opponent accepts that his first argument is a correlation so there is no need to strengthen my argument there.  My opponents second argument states, '''When the Earth comes out of an ice age, the warming is not initiated by CO2 but by changes in the Earth's orbit. The warming causes the oceans to release CO2. The CO2 amplifies the warming and mixes through the atmosphere, spreading warming throughout the planet. So CO2 causes warming AND rising temperature causes CO2 rise. Overall, about 90% of the global warming occurs after the CO2 increase.'''  To disprove this I will do it line by line.  Line 1: When the Earth comes out of an ice age, the warming is not initiated by CO2 but by changes in the Earth's orbit This line is true but only in some cases. For example, the mini ice age, which we exited 1000 years ago, was not initiated by changes in the earths orbit.  Line 2: This line is just wrong. The oceans do store Co2 but what is released when they warm is mostly water vapor, not Co2. This water vapor then causes more clouds which then cools the Earth. This is common knowledge among scientists because this is exactly how cosmic rays cause cooling.  Line 3: Yes, rising temperature causes more Co2 to be released but by simply looking at ice core data we can see that this does not cause an infinite rise in temperature. The temperature then drops and rises again independent of the Co2 that was released from the previous rise. For an example, look at this graph: My opponents next argument is just plain wrong. My opponent states, ''Even if we ignore long term trends and just look at the record-breakers, 2015, 2014, 2010, and 2005 were hotter than 1998.  The myth of no warming since 1998 was based on the satellite record estimates of the temperature of the atmosphere. However, as discussed in the video below by Peter Sinclair, even that argument is no longer accurate. The satellites show warming since 1998 too.' '  To disprove this all you need to do is read the caption at the top of the graph below where it lists its source. As you can see, the graph was not based on temperature estimates but the 'global mean temperature change...' I don't know where you got the idea that 2015, 2014, 2010, and 2005 were hotter than 1998 but from your sources it seems that this data is only true once you remove the El Nino. My question to you is why hasn't the Earth warmed since the El Nino. In the 20 years since the temperature maximum temperature doesn't increase at all. In addition to this, the El Nino just proves the fact that there are other influences in climate that influence temperature more then Co2 or enough to distort data.  For my opponents next argument he states that my source is not credible. This is just not true. Just because the maker of the website is paid to research evidence against man made global warming does not immediately make all of his evidence untrue. My opponent does not provide any actual contrary evidence to debate this point but to satisfy their needs I will give a link to multiple graphs sourced from other websites showing the same thing. My opponents next argument is not relevant to man made climate change.  My opponents next argument states, 'Not every prediction in the Inconvenient Truth came true. Nevertheless polar bears are struggling and many ice caps are melting. [5]  As for the polar bears this is due to hunting restrictions and bans. '  I will cede this point to my opponent as it is a result of warming and not relevant to man causing the warming. I should not have brought it up and while I still have arguments to dispute it do not wish to argue this view any longer.  As for why the documentary was manipulated, I do not wish to argue this any more either for the same reasons listed above nevertheless I will provide a short article to explain my first argument. I know that the article does not provide much info on the subject but if you really want to understand the argument then you need to research it yourself. Nextl, to strengthen my point of the debate, I will argue that Earth is not the only planet warming. The entire solar system seems to be going through a sort of 'climate-change phase.' Within the last 20 years scientists at NASA and around the world have realized that the planets we are looking at now are different than those in 1900s. This indicates that the entire solar system is in some sort of solar-system wide climate change.  For example, the ice caps on Mars are shrinking (indicating warming) and the atmosphere is gaining clouds and ozone, Pluto is experiencing a growth of its mysterious dark spots and is experiencing a 300% increase in atmospheric pressure (indicating warming), Saturn is giving off large amount of x rays and there are new appearances of 'hot spots' in its atmosphere (indicating warming), there have been polar shifts on Uranus and voyager 2 picked up large storm spots In its atmosphere that were not there 50 years ago (indicating warming), Mercury is growing a magnetic field, Jupiter's 'white ovals' are disappearing and melding together in its atmosphere (this is theorized to have been caused by an 18 degree Celsius warming and this is supported by the new large storm spots appearing on Jupiter for the first time), Venus has had a 2500% increase in green glow which symbolizes oxygen in the atmosphere, and Neptune is experiencing changes in light intensity.  As you can see from the long paragraph I have provided above, the entire Solar System seems to be warming or experiencing some sort of weird climate change patterns. This indicates more then just a global event.  To conclude my argument, I will provide a graph of Co2 and Temperature over the long term that should, on its own, disprove entirely the idea of man-made climate change. </t>

    <t>First, I would like to thank my opponent for debating this topic with me in a respectful manner. Courage is needed to go against the majority. Second, I would like to note my opponent's response is very dense. To disprove my opponent's arguments I need to take my opponent's statements a few sentences at a time. 'Your first argument, 'Carbon dioxide is at 404.48 parts per million and the temperature has increased 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880.' That is not a scientific argument. It is a correlation. There is no REAL evidence to suggest that Co2 impact temperature.' rammer5678Yes, you are correct as presented it is a correlation. I will now show that there is causation. ''When the Earth comes out of an ice age, the warming is not initiated by CO2 but by changes in the Earth's orbit. The warming causes the oceans to release CO2. The CO2 amplifies the warming and mixes through the atmosphere, spreading warming throughout the planet. So CO2 causes warming AND rising temperature causes CO2 rise. Overall, about 90% of the global warming occurs after the CO2 increase.'' [2]There should be no doubt that CO2 causes global warming. 'Especially when 25% of all Co2 produced by man has been released in the last 20 years and in that time there has been NO NET WARMING!!!' rammer5678All caps always helps prove science. Temperatures have risen. In 2005, 2010, 2014, and 2015 were hotter than 1998. 'Even if we ignore long term trends and just look at the record-breakers, 2015, 2014, 2010, and 2005 were hotter than 1998.The myth of no warming since 1998 was based on the satellite record estimates of the temperature of the atmosphere. However, as discussed in the video below by Peter Sinclair, even that argument is no longer accurate. The satellites show warming since 1998 too.' [3]Temperatures have risen in the last twenty years. 'You also make it sound like 1.4 degrees is what was predicted by the models showing Co2 causing temperature. I wasn't.' rammer5678You are correct that not all the models were correct. The overall premise is correct that the planet is getting warmer due to CO2. As for your link from wattsupwiththat.com, this is a known climate change denial site. The site is run by Willard Anthony Watts. He is a paid AGW denier, Anthropogenic Global Warming denier. 'Willard Anthony Watts (Anthony Watts) is a blogger, weathercaster and non-scientist, paid AGW denier who runs the website wattsupwiththat.com. He does not have a university qualification and has no climate credentials other than being a radio weather announcer. His website is parodied and debunked at the website wottsupwiththat.com Watts is on the payroll of the Heartland Institute, which itself is funded by polluting industries.[1]' [4]Your source is not credible. Voters please give me the more credible source points if nothing else.'You make a reference to cigarette companies. Please remember that we are talking about Man Made Global Warming, not cigarettes. Keep your own habits to yourself.' rammer5678Yes, this is true. Nevertheless this should impact the resolution since it shows historical evidence of how malice and greed can hold science at bay. Cigarette companies show the depths that people will sink to. 'Al Gores, 'The Inconvenient Truth' predicted that all the arctic ice caps would be melted by 2013. In case you haven't noticed, the ice caps are still there. He also predicted the polar bears would all have died out by now. That hasn't happened.' Rammer5678Not every prediction in the Inconvenient Truth came true. Nevertheless polar bears are struggling and many ice caps are melting. [5]As for the polar bears this is due to hunting restrictions and bans. ' The introduction of the International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears in 1973, which restricted or even banned hunting in some circumstances, consequently resulted in an increase in polar bear numbers.' [6]As you can see, I've destroyed all your arguments while proving causation of CO2 to increase temperature. A few notes, the polar bears are still in danger in the long term. [7] The ice caps melting has provided less hunting ground for them.You also make some inflammatory remarks like Al Gore's documentary was riddled with lies. Many of the predictions have come true. Also, there is a large difference between a falsehood and a lie. The models could not take in every single factor. As time prorgresses we get more and more accurate models. You have provided no evidence that the documentary was manpiulated. A person with the best of intentions can come to the wrong conclusion. Thanks for debating. You are making me work for victory.</t>

    <t>There is so much information on the topic that rather than reiterate all of it I will make a short summary. Also burden of proof will be 51% on my opponent and 49% on me. Manmade global climate change is the general increase in temperature at rapid rates that is mainly caused by CO2 from industry increases. Carbon dioxide is at 404.48 parts per million and the temperature has increased 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880. [0]Although 1.4 degrees doesn't sound much, it ends up being a lot. This is because not all areas of the world heat at the same rate and such a rapid change is hard to adapt to. There is no signs of relief from climate change. My opponent will attempt to deny climate change, but please remember how long the cigarette companies held out despite the science being heavily against them. Now we know as sure as the sun rises that cigarettes cause cancer. I can honestly state that as sure as the sun rises, global climate change is upon us and is a threat. Al Gore's inconvenient truth is still a master piece, and I will not accept defeat until my opponent can defeat the documentary. [1]Not watching Al Gore's documentary is no excuse.

    <t>My opponent does not counter-argue even one of the points I made in my previous arguments/in the comment section. Instead he accuses of of making the argument grow in size to confuse people. Not only is this not true, but it points out how little my opponent understands my argument and this subject. If he had simply read the counter arguments I provided, you can see clearly that I do not try to distract from the topic at hand.  Seeing as my opponent made no further arguments and did not make any comments about how I disproved all of his (relating to man causing the warming) claims, I am only left with the option to strengthen my own argument.  Fact 1: Co2 is a weak greenhouse gas. According to atomic absorption spectroscopy, a method in science used to measure the amount of the electromagnetic spectrum a molecule can store/release, Co2 can only store 7% of the heat that passes through it in the 15 micrometer range. This is minuscule, especially when compared to water vapor which can store 850% more heat then Co2 can.  Fact 2: There is not much Co2 in the atmosphere compared to the rest of the earths history and history tells us there is little to no correlation of temperature to Co2 over long periods of time. It is as simple as looking at this graph: Fact 3: Almost every single planet in the solar system is exhibiting some sort of characteristic attributed to warming. If every planet is warming simultaneously, then why is Earth warming not natural. (For more info check the comment section where there was a mini debate on the subject or my previous debate where I explained the attributes each planet it expressing)  Fact 3: There has been no significant warming in the last 20 years. We have already discussed this topic and my opponent brought up a good argument against it but I disproved it in my last argument (and the comment section). (Keep in mind that in the last 20 years 25% of all Co2 released by man has been released during that period)  Fact 4: The Earth has been warming for the last 20,000 years and the recent uptick started in the 1700's, before the industrial revolution. Fact 5: Sun spots and ocean currents correlated stronger with temperature then Co2 for the majority of the 1900s. Yes, sun spot numbers decreased towards the end of the 1900s but that is also right before temperatures flat lined. Sun Spots Graph: (According to Joe Bastardi the correlation) is .57 1900-2004). Ocean Current Graph: (According to Joe Bastardi the correlation here is .85 1900s-2007) Co2 Graph: (According to Joe Bastardi the correlation (not on this exact graph) is .47 1895-2007). Fact 6: Cosmic rays prove that greenhouse gasses do not have a big impact on the atmosphere. Cosmic rays effect temperature by increasing evaporation, and, in turn, causing more cloud cover which reflects the suns heat off the earth. This disproves man-made climate change because the water vapor doesn't cause the earth to warm more than the clouds it forms causes the Earth to cool. This just proves the fact that other variables in the climate have way more of an effect on the overall temperature then most greenhouse gasses and the idea that Co2, which is weaker then water vapor, solely dictates climate is just plain wrong.  Fact 7: Almost every single climate model prediction warming from Co2 was wrong (see earlier argument for graphs)  Fact 8: There is no way to scientifically test, through a controlled experiment, whether Co2 causes enough warming to drive the atmosphere. You can test that the Co2 is a greenhouse gas, but you can't test that it is a strong enough greenhouse gas to impact global climate. This just proves that the idea that Co2 causes warming is not based in science. It is based off of faith in computer models or flawed logic.  In conclusion, I have now proven, beyond any doubt, that Co2 cannot be the main climate driver. I have given historical evidence, explained the flaws in the logic presented through cosmic ray induced cooling, shown how Co2 driving climate can't be scientifically tested, explained how we are not the only planet experiencing warming and described how much stronger other climate drivers are then Co2 by presenting correlation strengths of each driver. My opponent has effectively given up the argument and accused me of distracting the readers from the problem at hand. As you can see, just by reading the 8 facts listed above, I have not distracted, I have not manipulated. I have provided clear, easy to understand, proof to why my opponent is wrong. I have disproven all of his arguments, whether in the comment section or in my arguments presented above and given countless examples of evidence to why my side of the argument is correct. Thank you for reading this long debate and I hope you are certain of the right choice when you vote.  To my opponent: I will be very surprised if you are reading this because it seems you have been ignoring my arguments from the beginning. You are so biased towards your own opinion that I am surprised you even decided to read any of my arguments instead of saying, 'oh, he didn't separate the lines into enough paragraphs!' and ignoring them. I have looked at your past debates and concluded that, while you have done a good job at defeating some people, Retroz and maybe Epidexipteryx have both gotten the better of you. Even in your past debates (including the ones you have won) you have not been able to prove anything you claim. You attack sources, you focus on grammar, but you don't focus on your argument. This is why you attacked the whatsupwiththat website without providing any actual evidence showing the data I presented from it was wrong. In fact, you even admitted it was right! This just proves that attacking sources doesn't get you anywhere with your argument. Just a side tip, if you are going to attack anyone else's sources in future arguments, skeptical science isn't a trustworthy website either. It is run by John Cook who is known for manipulating and masking real information as he did with the 97% consensus. Go to 3:02 in this video or watch the whole thing. Here is an article saying the same thing. Keep in mind that this renders almost every single one of your arguments useless so if this debate actually focused on how credible sources are, I would instantly win.  I thank you for participating in this debate, it was very fun, and I hope that we can both part from this as friends (or people that know each other online and happened to do a debate together whichever you prefer)</t>

    <t>I am here to debate the MAN MADE side of climate change. I do not disagree that the world is warming, I only believe the current warming trends are exaggerated and people are freaking out over a natural process.  Man Made Climate Change, The FACTS:  1.There is NO way to test whether Co2 is the most contributing factor to the world's climate: Many people I have met say, 'Manmade global warming is real and Co2 is the cause!' but how do you actually test that. Yes, Co2 is a greenhouse gas and traps warmth, I am not denying that. What we haven't tested is whether this warmth has a great enough impact to trump all other factors that influence climate. For example, ocean currents, cosmic rays, sun irradiance, the sun spot cycle, Earth's magnetic field, Earth's orbit, Earth's tilt, Volcanos, etc' all effect the climate. Why is Co2 more important than all of these factors? Let's find out! Oh, wait, you can't. This is where you reach a problem. How do you find out? You can't, scientifically, create a real, controlled experiment to test whether Co2 has a bigger impact than any of these other factors. This means that the entire idea that Co2 causes climate change is based on computer models and it can't actually be tested. This shows that the idea that Co2 causes warming is less science then it is religion because you are putting your faith in a computer model rather than observing and recording data. Keep in mind that simple correlations do not qualify as scientific data. Proof that greenhouse gasses don't have a large impact on climate can be found at the bottom of this page at 'Final Proof.' 2.The computer models don't work The computer models mentioned previously have been shown not to work time and time again. Even the most advanced ones fail and don't predict the correct temperature. This is because people think that Co2 has more of an impact then it really does so when they program it into the models it messes with the correct predictions. This is why the vast majority of climate models predict temperature is way higher than it is.  3.Co2 is a weak greenhouse gas According to atomic absorption spectroscopy, a method used to measure the amount of the electromagnetic spectrum a molecule can absorb, Co2 can only store a miniscule 7% of the amount of heat that passes through it in the 15 micrometer range. Compare this to water vapor, which, in statistics, can store 850% more heat than Co2 can. In addition to this, there is 2100000% more water vapor in the air then Co2. This shows that Co2 is actually a relatively weak greenhouse gas and for it to make an impact you would need much more of it then there is now.  4.There is not as much Co2 as you might think I have constantly heard, over and over again, that there is too much Co2 in the atmosphere. The problem with this statement is that it is just plain wrong. Comparing the amount of Co2 we have in the atmosphere now (400 parts per million, ppm for short) and we have had in the last 650 million years shows that now we are in a Co2 starved era. For example, look at this graph: Keep in mind that this graph only goes back 650 million years. Co2 has been over 10000ppm in the past and temperature had been relatively low at that time.  5.The earth has been warming for 20,000 years now: Not only is the idea that Co2 is causing the recent warming preposterous, but it just doesn't make any sense. This is because the world has been warming naturally for the last 20,000 years and the recent uptick in warming started in the 1700s. Both of these time periods were before any humans were releasing any significant amount of Co2. This only proves that the current warm phase is natural. More evidence would be that there hasn't been any significant warming in the last 20 years. Yes, this is a small amount of time, but if temperature truly relied on Co2 as its main cause then surely the temperature should have gone up. Especially considering that 25% of all Co2 released by man ever has been released into the atmosphere in the last few decades.  The political side of things: This is a big topic so I won't be able to cover everything but I will do the most important topics under this subject. The 97% number: This number is thrown around way too often and most of the time misused. This number came from a study that stated as its conclusion, '97% of climate scientists agree that climate change is real' but everyone seems to think it said man-made climate change was real. Another problem with this number is that it came from a survey that completely manipulated almost every scientific paper that was submitted. All the papers in the survey were ultimately sent to one man (John Cook) who categorized based on what he thought they meant. Not only is this a biased way of filtering through papers but what the papers said depended on his opinion, not on their actual statements. This anti-science method of categorizing papers eventually led thousands of scientific papers to be misrepresented in the survey. Watch this video to hear what I said but in a more in-depth way: The 2 degree rise: This claim is also completely bogus. The idea that a 2 degree rise in average temperature is going to devastate the world is just plain wrong. The world was 2 degrees warmer during the medieval warming period 1000 years. Then, before the medieval warming period was the Roman warming period which was warmer then the medieval. Then, even before the Roman, there was the Minoan warming period which was 4 degrees Celsius warmer then today.  The hockey stick: The graph was fabricated and is completely fake and manipulated. I'm too lazy to explain it all so click on the presentation someone else made below to find out why I'm right: The final proof: And now, I present to you, the final proof of why man-made climate change isn't real: It is known that cosmic rays effect temperature by increasing evaporation, and, in turn, causing more cloud cover which reflects the suns heat off the earth. This disproves man-made climate change because the water vapor, which is 850% more potent then Co2, doesn't cause the earth to warm more than the clouds it forms causes the Earth to cool. This just proves the fact that other factors in the climate have way more of an effect on the overall temperature then most greenhouse gasses and the idea that Co2, which is weaker then water vapor, solely dictates climate is just plain wrong.</t>

    <t>If you wanted a serious debate then you would not have ignored my entire argument. So I guess since you are not paying attention to my arguments I will just have to disprove yours instead of adding to my own.  You firstly say that, 'The temperature has increased .87 Celsius.' This is true, but you forgot to mention that the warming period that caused this rise started in the 1700's before the industrial revolution. In addition to this, the world has been naturally warming for the last 20,000 years. You ignored large amounts of scientific data in your argument and made a claim that I agree with. The world IS WARMING!!! It just is not caused by man. According to your second argument, Co2 is at 400 ppm. This is true, but there has been no substantial warming for the last 20 years which is proof of how temperature and Co2 act independently. In addition to this, 25% of all Co2 released by man has been released during the last 20 year period. This in itself disproves your claim. In addition to this, Co2 has been at much higher levels in the past. To restate what I said above, 'Comparing the amount of Co2 we have in the atmosphere now (400 parts per million, ppm for short) and we have had in the last 650 million years shows that now we are in a Co2 starved era. For example, look at this graph. Keep in mind that this graph only goes back 650 million years. Co2 has been over 10000 ppm in the past and temperature had been relatively low at that time.'  There may be a clear and strong positive correlation between Co2 and temperature but this correlation has been weak compared to that of sun spots. For the majority of the 1900's sun spots correlated MORE STRONGLY to temperature then Co2 did. This means that sun spots had a bigger impact then Co2 on the temperature. Yes, I know that sun spot numbers dropped around the early 2000s but that is irrelevant because for the majority of the 1900's, when tons and tons of Co2 were released, the temperature was affected more by sun spots then it was by Co2. Another thing to point out, when sun spot numbers started to drop is when the flat line in temperature began. In actual statistics, according to Joe Bastardi, Co2 has a correlation strength to temperature of just .43 (1895-2007). Other sources say that the correlation strength is just .07 or .02 (1998-2007). Compare this correlation strength to the correlation strength of sunspots and the ocean, .57 (1900-2004) and .85 (1900-2007). In conclusion, not only have you ignored the majority of my first argument, you state claims that I am not even trying to disprove. You obviously don't understand what I am trying to debate or don't know how to debate my claims. In addition to this, you gave almost no evidence to support your claims, only sources of where you got the information. If you want to have a real debate, maybe reading my arguments would help.

Here are my reasons: 1.There is NO way to test whether Co2 is the most contributing factor to the world's climate: Many people I have met say, 'Man made global warming is real and Co2 is the cause!' but how do you actually test that. Yes, Co2 is a greenhouse gas and traps warmth, I am not denying that. What we haven't tested is whether this warmth has a great enough impact to trump all other factors that influence climate. For example, ocean currents, cosmic rays, sun irradiance, the sun spot cycle, Earth's magnetic field, Earth's orbit, Earth's tilt, Volcanos, etc' all effect the climate. Why is Co2 more important than all of these factors? Let's find out! Oh, wait, you can't. This is where you reach a problem. How do you find out? You can't, scientifically, create a real, controlled experiment to test whether Co2 has a bigger impact than any of these other factors. This means that the entire idea that Co2 causes climate change is based on computer models and it can't actually be tested. This shows that the idea that Co2 causes warming is less science then it is religion because you are putting your faith in a computer model rather than observing and recording data. Keep in mind that simple correlations do not qualify as scientific data. Proof that greenhouse gasses don't have a large impact on climate can be found at the bottom of this page at 'Final Proof.'  2.The computer models don't work The computer models mentioned previously have been shown not to work time and time again. Even the most advanced ones fail and don't predict the correct temperature. This is because people think that Co2 has more of an impact then it really does so when they program it into the models it messes with the correct predictions. This is why the vast majority of climate models predict temperature is way higher than it is. 3.Co2 is a weak greenhouse gas According to atomic absorption spectroscopy, a method used to measure the amount of the electromagnetic spectrum a molecule can absorb, Co2 can only store a miniscule 7% of the amount of heat that passes through it in the 15 micrometer range. Compare this to water vapor, which, in statistics, can store 850% more heat than Co2 can. In addition to this, there is 2100000% more water vapor in the air then Co2. This shows that Co2 is actually a relatively weak greenhouse gas and for it to make an impact you would need much more of it then there is now.  4.There is not as much Co2 as you might think I have constantly heard, over and over again, that there is too much Co2 in the atmosphere. The problem with this statement is that it is just plain wrong. Comparing the amount of Co2 we have in the atmosphere now (400 parts per million, ppm for short) and we have had in the last 650 million years shows that now we are in a Co2 starved era. For example, look at this graph. Keep in mind that this graph only goes back 650 million years. Co2 has been over 10000ppm in the past and temperature had been relatively low at that time.  5.The earth has been warming for 20,000 years now: Not only is the idea that Co2 is causing the recent warming preposterous, but it just doesn't make any sense. This is because the world has been warming naturally for the last 20,000 years and the recent uptick in warming started in the 1700s. Both of these time periods were before any humans were releasing any significant amount of Co2. This only proves that the current warm phase is natural. More evidence would be that there hasn't been any significant warming in the last 20 years. Yes, this is a small amount of time, but if temperature truly relied on Co2 as its main cause then surely the temperature should have gone up. Especially considering that 25% of all Co2 released by man ever has been released into the atmosphere in the last few decades.  The political side of things: This is a big topic so I won't be able to cover everything but I will do the most important topics under this subject. The 97% number: This number is thrown around way too often and most of the time misused. This number came from a study that stated as its conclusion, '97% of climate scientists agree that climate change is real' but everyone seems to think it said man-made climate change was real. Another problem with this number is that it came from a survey that completely manipulated almost every scientific paper that was submitted. All the papers in the survey were ultimately sent to one man (John Cook) who categorized based on what he thought they meant. Not only is this a biased way of filtering through papers but what the papers said depended on his opinion, not on their actual statements. This anti-science method of categorizing papers eventually led thousands of scientific papers to be misrepresented in the survey. Watch this video to hear what I said but in a more in-depth way. The 2 degree rise: This claim is also completely bogus. The idea that a 2 degree rise in average temperature is going to devastate the world is just plain wrong. The world was 2 degrees warmer during the medieval warming period 1000 years. Then, before the medieval warming period was the Roman warming period which was warmer then the medieval. Then, even before the Roman, there was the Minoan warming period which was 4 degrees Celsius warmer then today.  The hockey stick: The graph was fabricated and is completely fake and manipulated. I'm too lazy to explain it all so click on the presentation someone else made below to find out why I'm right. The final proof: And now, I present to you, the final proof of why man-made climate change isn't real: It is known that cosmic rays effect temperature by increasing evaporation, and, in turn, causing more cloud cover which reflects the suns heat off the earth. This disproves man-made climate change because the water vapor, which is 850% more potent then Co2, doesn't cause the earth to warm more than the clouds it forms causes the Earth to cool. This just proves the fact that other factors in the climate have way more of an effect on the overall temperature then most greenhouse gasses and the idea that Co2, which is weaker then water vapor, solely dictates climate is just plain wrong.</t>

    <t>*Sorry for assuming your gender but I didn't realize that I wrote 'he' instead of 'they' until the very end! :)  Im going to start my argument by countering my opponents observations. His first observation states that he will debate that humans are contributing to the already natural processes but my question is contributing how much. There is not doubt in my mind that Co2 causes warming. The question is whether this warming is significant or not. To clarify, I believe the warming Co2 creates is insignificant and barely has an effect on climate.  His second observation states that quoting a scientific consensus is science. He is correct in saying that a consensus is more scientific then a home experiment but a scientific paper or research article is better then both. Especially when there is so much controversy about the validity of the consensus.  My opponent then addresses my first argument and states, 'I will provide empirical evidence that in fact it has a huge impact if not the biggest' yet he provides no evidence after this claim.  I run into the same problem when he addresses my second claim. He says, ' there is other evidence that proves CO2 does have an impact' while providing NO scientific evidence. (keep in mind that correlations do NOT show causation so giving a graph of temperature and Co2 rising is not sufficient evidence) He also says that computer models are not always going to be 100% correct which is true but you would expect the predictions made by said models to be closer to the observations. The fact that only a small majority of the models show similar trends to our observations indicate that something is wrong with the models.  In my opponents addressing of my third statement, he makes a valid case, pointing out the fact that Co2 increases atmospheric humidity but disregards the fact that water vapor then condenses into clouds which then reflect heat and light energy away from the earth, therefore cooling it down. I mentioned this at the end of my argument under the label, 'The Final proof' where I explained how cosmic rays cause cooling and why this disproves the greenhouse effect.  My opponent then says, 'my opponent is stating we would need more CO2 to see an impact.' Although I did not state this before, I do agree with this statement. My opponent says this is a unscientific claim but ignores that planets, such as Venus, with extraordinary high (96%) levels of Co2 in their atmosphere are warmer because of it. Nasa says that venus would not be as hot as it is without Co2 or methane.  My opponent also says there is an undoubted correlation between Co2 and warming but this statement depends on what time period you are looking at. For example, according to Joe Bastardi, Co2 has a correlation strength to temperature of just .43 (1895-2007). Other sources say that the correlation strength is just .07 or .02 (1998-2007). according to Joe Bastardi, Co2 has a correlation strength to temperature of just .43 (1895-2007). Compare this correlation strength to the correlation strength of sunspots and the ocean, .57 (1900-2004) and .85 (1900-2007). As you can see, the correlation strength of Co2 compared to other correlations is anything but strong. Another thing to point out is that over longer periods of time, Co2 has almost no correlation to temperature. I meant to put this graph in my argument above but I posted the wrong link so here is the evidence supporting my claim. Then my opponent states the Co2 has not been higher then today within the last 800,000 years. This is true, but there is a problem this points out. The temperature HAS been higher then today. This just proves that temperature acts independent of Co2. Co2 has not been higher then today while temperature has risen up to 4 degrees Celsius hotter then today. Then, in my opponents fifth point, he states, 'Today though, we are seeing this clearly attributed to CO2 in the air from humans as the temperature goes beyond what would be seen as natural.' This is just an untrue statement. The majority of the worlds lifespan has been spent with no ice on the poles and the dinosaurs lived in an environment that was much hotter then today. Also, as I mentioned earlier, in the past 1000 years, during the medieval warming period, temperature was 2 degrees Celsius warmer then today and that was only in the last 1000 years!  Thanks for acknowledging that the political arguments are irrelevant, I have argued with many people about this topic before and the political arguments always come up so I wanted to include some just to ward people off if that is what they were planning to debate.  In my opponents case he just states everything that I have already disproven.  He says greenhouse gasses cause warming but Co2 is a very weak greenhouse gas and there is not much of it in the atmosphere.  He says humans are netting 15 gigatons of Co2 into the atmosphere which is true but he doesn't explain why, if there is so much Co2 in the air, there has been no significant warming in the last 2 decades. Especially when 25% of all human caused Co2 emissions occurred during that time period. Another problem is that the chart he provided of the carbon cycle is wrong. I have seen charts like it before and the problem with them is that they don't explain rises in Co2, sometimes over periods of millions of years, in the past. According to that chart, Co2 would be on a constant decline. We know this is not true because looking at a graph he provided us Co2 is constantly in balance with the environment. It is not on an overall decrease.  To my opponents final message, I don't know why the atmosphere is warming if it is not caused by Co2. I am not even going to try and come up with other reasons because the climate is constantly changing and to complex for me to completely understand. I have seen the video you sent me, along with all the other videos in that college course. The problem with the video is that it relies on the idea that Co2 causes warming. Without any significant warming affects, how do they know the 'fingerprint' it leaves? This just causes a loop back to the debate about whether it actually causes warming or not.  After reading your responses and acknowledging the claims you have made, I see no real scientific evidence of man-made global warming. Yes, there are correlations and yes, there are consensuses, but none of these are true pieces of evidence. True evidence would be performing a controlled experiment and testing only 1 variable at a time. As I explained in my first argument, this is not possible.  In conclusion, I await your next argument and wish you the best of luck in debating me.</t>

    <t>My opponent kept mentioning that I was making claims without backing them. I was unclear but that's because my case was at the bottom and had gone over that evidence. To eliminate as much confusion as possible I will add all that evidence with those statements that appeared to have none.  My evidence that CO2 has a huge impact is here:  1: My opponent has acknowledged that CO2 is a green house gas. Green house gasses cause global warming.  2: humans are netting 15 gigatons of carbon into the atmosphere that has no place in the carbon cycle. Prior to industry all carbon fit into the cycle. 3: If CO2 causes warming, and humans are omitting extra CO2 that we are having an impact on climate. Thus I hold my claim that humans are impacting climate change.  Of course my opponent clarified that the real debate is how much CO2 has an impact and whether it is miniscule. So they would say some measure that CO2 is a major player in changing the climate. That evidence is in trends in the atmosphere where lower layers are heating up and upper layers are not. This is a sign of CO2 causing the heating.  On top of that, use my opponents point that if venus didn't have as much CO2 they would be significantly cooler. This proves that there is significant correlation between CO2 and climate. Then throw in how much CO2 humans throw into the atmosphere and what trends we are seeing now and conclude for yourself.  This all rest the case that climate change is being effected by men. My opponent is probably going to argue that they need to see cold hard numbers, but this is not grounds to throw out the logic I have provided. Its impossible to measure with certainty exactly how much people are impacting. But the logic is there and evidence does point to CO2 being the main cause.  Also, just in case my opponent isn't sure that CO2 is coming from people, I ask he or she look to this evidence again that shows the carbon cycle was working naturally until industrial CO2 overloaded it. My opponent is always saying that the correlation is not strong. For this just keep in mind the physical signs we are seeing that it is CO2 such as the atmospheric patterns of heating showing that CO2 is the cause of this, not other signs. It doesn't get much more scientific.  My opponent writes 'Then my opponent states the Co2 has not been higher then today within the last 800,000 years. This is true, but there is a problem this points out. The temperature HAS been higher then today. This just proves that temperature acts independent of Co2. Co2 has not been higher then today while temperature has risen up to 4 degrees Celsius hotter then today. 'Of course the graph they is of one place which is a spotlight fallacy. You can't point to one location. Also the largest difference in temperatures is in 7 degrees Fahrenheit over the past 10,000 years.  When my opponent quotes me saying the temperature todays is unnatural, they misunderstood my point.  I wasn't saying that extreme temperatures haven't occurred naturally. I meant that we would expect the dramatic changes to be much further apart. In the years before the recent era major changes in climate were rare and on somewhat of a cycle of hot to cold and back with even spacing of time. now we are seeing changes much more erratically and quickly.  My opponent is arguing that man made climate change has not been proven with fool proof certainty and has turned this into an evidence debate. So far this debate has been a debate of clashing evidence that cancel out each-others claims. There has been a lot of research on each side that can just as reliably disprove the other. At this point it is time to look to logical claims and each side ought to put up some logic to the claim.  I have given a clear thought process as to why men and women have had an impact on the climate. I would like to see logical sequential ideas that lead to the notion that climate change must be all natural.  Thanks for this debate to this point so far. (:</t>

    <t>First I would like to thank my opponent for the opportunity for this debate,  I would like to start by making a few observations: 1) I am arguing that the human race has had a measurable impact on global warming. I acknowledge that natural climate change does happen. I will debate that humans are contributing to recent global warming. 2) My opponent says that quoting a consensus is not science. However, it has to be seen that a scientific study by real scientists is going to be more reliable than some kind of theory or home conducted experiment.  Before we begin I would just like to ask for evidence behind the claims in point 3 just for reference.  I will begin by analyzing my opponents case and then move on to my own.  My opponents 1st point states that there is no hard proof that CO2 from humans is the most important part to causing global warming. Even if it's not the MOST important part, if humans have any impact than we are changing the climate from what is natural. I will provide empirical evidence that in fact it has a huge impact if not the biggest.  2: My opponent argues that the computer models don't work. Even if this is true, there is other evidence that proves CO2 does have an impact. Also, computer models are just a way of prediction and we can't expect them to be 100% correct.  3: My opponent argued that CO2 is a weak greenhouse gas. My opponent argues that water vapor has a stronger green house effect. Even if this is true, adding CO2 to the atmosphere is actually a cause for more humid atmosphere making it worse. So even if you believe my opponent that it is actually the water vapor that is the more disastrous greenhouse gas, this problem stems from CO2 also, which stems from humans. Basically my opponent is stating we would need more CO2 to see an impact which is not a scientific claim and there is an undoubted correlation between CO2 and warming.  4: In response to my opponents claim that their is less CO2 now than ever before, according to Freedman at climate central, 'CO2 levels are far higher now than they have been for anytime during the past 800,000 years.' Also, from NASA. 'atmospheric carbon dioxide does naturally fluctuate, but it's never been has high as it is today' (i would recommend looking at this graph for the link provided!  5: Your statement about the temperature increasing for the past 20,000 years is true, however that was when the last severe cold stage in the climate happened. So naturally the climate is on its way to being warmer.  Today though, we are seeing this clearly attributed to CO2 in the air from humans as the temperature goes beyond what would be seen as natural.  As for the political arguments. That is probably all true, but does not prove that humans don't have to do with global warming.  Now for my case:  1: Humans are altering the climate.  My evidence comes in 3 stages.  1: My opponent has acknowledged that CO2 is a green house gas. Green house gasses cause global warming.  2: humans are netting 15 gigatons of carbon into the atmosphere that has no place in the carbon cycle. Prior to industry all carbon fit into the cycle. 3: If CO2 causes warming, and humans are omitting extra CO2 that we are having an impact on climate. Thus I hold my claim that humans are impacting climate change.  Some may still remain skeptical in believing that there are things that may not be CO2 causing global warming. While other causes like volcanic eruptions, or the tilt of the earth have had causes thousands of year ago. We are seeing trends in the the atmoshphere that point to CO2 being the cause as opposed to thermal energy. Check out the video here.</t>

    <t>My opponents first second and third points state, 'My opponent has acknowledged that CO2 is a green house gas. Green house gasses cause global warming... humans are netting 15 gigatons of carbon into the atmosphere that has no place in the carbon cycle. Prior to industry all carbon fit into the cycle... If CO2 causes warming, and humans are omitting extra CO2 that we are having an impact on climate. Thus I hold my claim that humans are impacting climate change.'  To respond to this, I would like to bring up the argument that there is not that much Co2 in the atmosphere compared to the Earths past. 15 gigatons sounds like a lot but it compared to the Earths past Co2 has been much higher. In addition to this, historical evidence shows that Co2 has no correlation to temperature and most ice core data shows that higher temperature causes Co2 increase, not the other way around.  My opponents next claim is that there are significant 'fingerprints' caused by Co2 induced heating in the atmosphere. This is not a valid point because I am arguing that Co2 doesn't cause enough heat to significantly impact the atmosphere in the way my opponent is describing. This just brings us in a circle back to the argument that is if CO2 causes warming or not.  My opponents next correlation is that since Venus has high Co2 concentrations and it is known that this is why venus is hot it would make sense that we would be seeing the same effects on Earth.  My response to this is that Venus's atmosphere is 96% Co2. This is more then enough Co2 to have a significant impact on its atmosphere. This is drastically different from Earth where only about .03% of our atmosphere is Co2.  I agree that humans are putting Co2 into the atmosphere  My opponent then states that we are seeing rapid climate changes and that this is unnatural about the current climate change. While we are experiencing rapid rates of climate change, these changes are not unique to Earth. The entire solar system seems to be going through a sort of 'climate-change phase.' Within the last 20 years scientists at NASA and around the world have realized that the planets we are looking at now are different than those in 1900s. This indicates that the entire solar system is in some sort of solar-system wide climate change. For example, the ice caps on Mars are shrinking (indicating warming) and the atmosphere is gaining clouds and ozone, Pluto is experiencing a growth of its mysterious dark spots and is experiencing a 300% increase in atmospheric pressure (indicating warming), Saturn is giving off large amount of x rays and there are new appearances of 'hot spots' in its atmosphere (indicating warming), there have been polar shifts on Uranus and voyager 2 picked up large storm spots In its atmosphere that were not there 50 years ago (indicating warming), Mercury is growing a magnetic field and polar ice caps, Jupiter's plasma clouds melding together in its atmosphere and becoming brighter (this is theorized to have been caused by an 18 degree Celsius warming and this is supported by the new large storm spots appearing on Jupiter for the first time), Venus has had a 2500% increase in green glow which symbolizes oxygen in the atmosphere, and Neptune is experiencing changes in light intensity. A dramatic shift that may be the cause of all these weird interplanetary changes is that the suns magnetic field is increasing in strength. Over the last 100 years, the suns magnetic field has increased by 230%. This increase attracts stardust from the surrounding area and this overflow of stardust may have something to do with this solar-system wide event. This evidence shows how Earth is not the only planet going through a rapid period of climate change. This indicates that something solar-system wide may be to blame for the recent fluctuations in temperature, not Co2.  In addition to this, compared to the past 100,000 years, the rate of temperature increase does not seem to be any more rapid then it has been in the past. For example, look at this graph. In fact, looking at this graph shows that we are seeing even less fluctuations in temperature then we have in the past. This means that the rate of change and increase is unnatural because it is slow, not fast.  I have now disproven all of your claims and look forward to your next argument. No, thank you for the debate :)</t>

    <t>My opponent is correct the Earth's temperature has been hotter a long time ago. This falls into the stage 4a of climate change denial. [2] Meaning my opponent accepts the first part of the resolution but rejects the second half.The problem is not the temperature itself, but the rate of change. High rate of temperature change historically has lead to mass extinction. In summary, species including humans will struggle to adapt to such changes, if adaptation to such a change is even possible.

    <t>In this round I will be refuting my opponent's arguments and I will be resupporting my own arguments My opponent stated'First my arguments still stand. I think everyone already knows the Pope is not a climate change scientist.'But what my opponent fails to realize is that quoting the pope is not an argument, an argument needs evidence, the quote from the Pope is not evidence of climate change, rather it is only a claim followed by my opponent's warrant. You can't just quote the pope and call it an argument, thus you have no first argument. The Pope's statement does not further your case (unless he was a climate scientist, then it would)So, because the pope is not a climate researcher I really don't even need to refute his statement but I have done so by showing that the Pope is not a climate scientist. In his first rebuttal my opponent stated that'science has shown repeatably that CO2 emissions increase green house gases', but he shows no specific evidence of this occurring. Then my opponent quotes the EPA 'The main human activity that emits CO2 is the combustion of fossil fuels' However, if this were true then how come the decade long decrease in CO2 was seen, even as fossil fuel combustion increased (In the US alone 3 billion more barrels were used per year). In fact, my opponent conceded that point when he said 'Why CO2 levels happen to drop that year is uncertain', so my opponent has conceded my first point. My opponent stated in rebuttal 2'Argument two is cherry picking.'But he shows no evidence of how it is cherry picking... Thus, this statement ought not to be considered, however I will prove how my second argument was not cherry picking... The definition of cherry picking is 'When only select evidence is presented in order to persuade the audience to accept a position, and evidence that would go against the position is withheld.' [1]However, I have not cherry picked evidence because of the fact that I offered the statistical analysis of two major climate research satellites which have had their results peer reviewed by the scientific community and been found to be accurate. In fact, if I had cherry picked this evidence it would not show the .2 degree warming trend that it did...What is even more ironic is that my opponent goes on to say 'El Nino was responsible for the height of the graph.' But even I conceded that the warming trend was there, in fact my opponent just contradicted his entire case by calling the warming trend that was apparent on the graph; El Nino, a regional, natural phenomena, that has nothing to do with Global Climate Change. So, if El Nino caused the warming trend on the graph, then Global Warming is a hoax because all warming trends over the period of the graph can be explained by El Nino (He said it, I didn't). My opponent in rebuttal 3 stated 'First, any argument that tries to use a regional phenomenon to disprove a global trend is dead in the water. Anthropogenic global warming theory does not predict uniform warming throughout the globe. We need to assess the balance of the evidence.'By definition if the phenomena is not experienced GLOBALLY, then GLOBAL Climate Change is not occurring [1] (simple definition 1)'Second, ice-sheet thickening is not inconsistent with warming! Warmer climates tend toward more precipitation. The Antarctic is one of the most extreme deserts on the planet. As it warms, we would expect it to receive more snow. But even a whopping warming of 20 degrees ' say, from -50 degrees C to -30 degrees C ' would still leave it below freezing, so the snow wouldn't't melt. Thus, an increase in ice mass.'If this is true then how come one of the biggest proponents of Global Warming said that the poles would be ice free by 2013 [2], Leon Penetta once said [while talking about Global Climate Change] 'The melting of the Polar Ice Caps' [3]. There seems to be a consensus among scientists and Global Warming Theorists that the Ice caps will melt when Global Warming occurs. Then How did my opponent find contradictory evidence? He found such evidence because he quoted a man with 0 climate science experience. His sources 4,5, and 6 are written by Coby Beck 'Former musician, turned tree planter, turned software engineer.' [4] So, any quote by him ought to be ignored because it offers no expert value or value of any sort. In fact, my opponent is not even quoting the credible science in some of Beck's blogs, my opponent is quoting Beck's opinions which hold no value. My opponent in his 4th rebuttal quotes the same man again... and his statement ought to be ignored but in another one of my opponent's contradictory statements, he says 'temperature moved first [in relation to CO2]', but if this is true, then how come the IPCC said that CO2 caused temperature to move? Which one is it? Either way my opponent has contradicted Global Warming theory as we are debating it and has negated his own refutation. My opponent's graph is quite interesting. The graph appears to show a correlation between CO2 and Temperature, however there are several occasions of temperature and CO2 acting independently, one major example is 400k years before present when the temperature increased dramatically for a (relatively) short period while CO2 decreased, and then again around 380k years ago where temperature decreased dramatically while CO2 increased. So, my opponent's chart, however intriguing, shows once again, that temperature and CO2 act independently from one another. Now I will Strengthen my original cases1: Fossil Fuels do not cause an increase in CO2 emissions, which makes the first part of the IPCC's basic version of global warming invalidMy opponent has conceded this point (see above for more details)2: Despite common belief the last few years have not been the warmest on recordI have shown my opponent's rebuttal of this claim to be false, and his claim of a logical fallacy to be false, however I'd like to strengthen this point more. USCRN the largest and most advanced climate research network in the US has shown a decade long cooling trend. While the trend is statistically 0, it still shows no evidence of global warming. If the entire world is warming, (definition of Global Warming, see above) then how come the United States isn't? [5]s://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com...; alt='' width='1005' height='551' /gt;Furthering my point, A large integrated network of Argo ocean buoys operated by the British Oceanographic Data Center in combination with satellite-enhanced data reveal no statistical warming. Again I posit the question, If the world is warming, then how come the US AND Britain (and the surrounding ocean) are not. [6] 3: Antarctic Ice was larger than ever in 2012 and 2014, thus the Antarctic Ice caps have not been melting which is thought to be a sideffect of the Global Warming theorySeeing as my opponent's refutation of this point was insufficient, I do not feel the need to strengthen this point. 4: There is no direct link between CO2 Emissions and Temperature IncreasesAs I have refuted my opponent's statements about this point I'd like to point out that my opponent has neglected to mention both of my charts for this point, both of which show an obvious independence between CO2 and Temperature, even over the time span of millions of years of data. Judges, seeing as my opponent has not fulfilled his BoP at this point in the debate you would be required to vote in favor of the Con. I look forward to reading my opponent's next argument, and I'd like to say that I'm enjoying this debate. </t>

    <t>Thank you for posting this debate, I hope to be a worthy opponent!!!!Your argument is based on the pope's opinion as well as a scientific documentaryMy argument will be based on historical evidence as well as current scientific evidence that contradicts the theory of Global Climate ChangeFirst I'd like to clarify that Global Warming and Global Climate Change are the same theory with a different name and I will treat them as such. First, I'd like to define Global Climate Change (or Warming)Thus the theory of Global Climate Change (warming) is - a change in global climate patterns, in particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onward and attributed to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels.I'd like to give a more simplified version of the above statement by giving this general statement released by the IPCC on what Climate Change is 'Increasing fossil fuel causes increasing carbon dioxide in the air; and increasing carbon dioxide in the air causes climate change.'Next, I'd like to refute my opponent's argumentsArgument 1) Pope Francis recognizes climate change and he 'Knows what he is doing and thus man-made global climate change is real and a threat' My Response: Pope Francis has no college degree in science (he does have a 'titulo' as a chemical technician, which is not a college degree) and either way he is not a climatologist and his opinion does not count as an expert's opinion and his opinion is on par with the opinion of world leaders and celebrities... Essentially, his opinion on climate change is just as important as the opinion of Vladimir Putin's, neither count as an expert, but their opinion's count as a World Leader's opinion. Argument 2) An Inconvenient Truth My Response: I will watch the entirety of this movie so I can refute the movie in my next argumentNow I will give my basic arguments1: Fossil Fuels do not cause an increase in CO2 emissions, which makes the first part of the IPCC's basic version of global warming invalidDuring World War II, U.S. oil production increased by 3 billion barrels annually during the war. Both the Allies and the Axis used incredible amounts of oil and the best scientific data available, which is from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, shows that carbon dioxide levels literally 'flat-lined' during the decade between 1940 and 1950 staying at 311.3 PPM and actually going down between 1941 and 1945, (the period that the US was in the war) [1] So, how did burning another 12+ billion barrels of oil not increase CO2???? Because, there is no direct link between oil usage and CO2 emissions in the atmosphere. Of course CO2 is a byproduct of the burning of oil, but that CO2 has had little to no affect on atmospheric CO2 as seen in my example above.2: Despite common belief the last few years have not been the warmest on record... According to the UAH and RSS climate research satellites there had been no warming between the late 90's and 2015 in fact 2014, was only .01 degrees hotter than 2005, and 2013 was only .02 degrees warmer than 2005. The conclusion from the analysis of the data is that while there has been a .05 degree warming trend since 2002, according to researchers that is 'statistically insignificant' [2] The small upward trend from 1978 to 2015 is .2 degrees Celsius and is once again classifiable as statistically insignificant and is not proof of any man made global warming, in fact the lack of a significant upward trend shows not only that global warming predictions on climate and temperatures have been well off, but that there may not be any man made global warming at all. (excuse the site on the chart, woodfortrees.org is not where I got the chart, the source I used for the chart is the one listed as source 2)3: Antarctic Ice was larger than ever in 2012 and 2014, thus the Antarctic Ice caps have not been melting which is thought to be a sideffect of the Global Warming theoryNASA satillites discovered that the antarctic sea ice had reached a new record high in 2012 and then again in 2014, in 2014 it set a record for the largest Antarctic Sea Ice in recorded history [3]. Global Warming theory dictates that the Ice caps would begin to melt at an alarming rate, but if that's the case then how come this has occurred. In fact Al Gore and many Global Warming theorists stated that the ice caps would be completley gone by 2013, when the exact opposite has occurred.The red line in the photo is the largest that the ice had ever been recorded at.4: There is no direct link between CO2 Emissions and Temperature Increaseslook at both of the below charts, the first chart is CO2 and temperature data for the last 750 million years, each blue dot represents the temperature and CO2 levels. What you can see is that the dots are everywhere and seemingly when CO2 is raised the dots tend to be higher, but there are several dots (call them outliers if you wish) that even nearing 5000 PPM CO2 are still cooler than the average Earth Temperature. On top of this, why are there dots near the 1000 PPM range that are higher up on the anomaly range than the dots at 7000 PPM.The Second chart shows CO2 and Temperature from 1999 to 2014, what can be seen is a very, very small trend line which is again considered Statistically Insignificant, showing no proof of a global climate change. (specifically the trend is .00668, which is essentially 0 to statisticians). Both Charts show a lack of evidence with CO2 and Temperature, In fact, it could be said that there is no correlation between CO2 and Temperature Change. However IPCC's definition of Global Climate Change requires such a correlation and if such a correlation is not apparent than Climate Change theory is flawed and thus Global Climate Change would not exist. So, based on all 4 of my points I am in firm negation of the topic in which we are debating. Thank you for reading this argument and looking at my charts!!! I hope you understood it, and I can't to see your next round.I'd like to remind my opponent of his BoP, which because of him being the pro he must prove specifically that Man Made Climate change is real and a threat he must prove this beyond a shadow of a doubt, my BoP is not to disprove Climate Change but rather to cast a shadow of a doubt, similar to a court case the judges must not have ANY SHADOW OF A DOUBT that he has won or they must give me the victory.</t>

    <t>My opponent stated that'First and foremost, my opponent has dropped the issue of the Inconvenient truth documentary' However, my entire case has been in contradiction to the inconvenient truth documentary, as seen when my opponent states 'scientific evidence clearly backs up this claim in the documentary an inconvenient truth', I have offered scientific in direct contradiction to the scientific evidence in the movie, thus I have negated my opponent's ENTIRE argument. ' As for the Pope's contribution, this shows just how much climate change deniers are within the minority.'Seeing as my opponent likes to spew out the term 'fallacy', I will spew out the term band wagon fallacy which this argument is, because The bandwagon fallacy is committed by arguments that appeal to the growing popularity of an idea as a reason for accepting it as true. My opponent has admitted to doing this by sating that 'climate change deniers are within the minority' In my opponent's (rather short) rebuttal he said that I was cherry picking again (in my first argument) He did show that I chose a time fame that best suits me, but that time frame that best suits me shows a DIRECT INDEPENDENCE between oil consumption and CO2 in the atmosphere. This isn't cherry picking because I didn't just show a single year or two of independence I showed an entire decade of data. Not only this, but in my 3rd graph (on my first argument) I showed how CO2 levels has been extremely higher than we've ever seen in humanity's history (in some cases over 8000 PPM well before the industrial revolution). Once again I showed independence between ATMOSPHERIC CO2 and Fossil Fuel Consumption. My opponent doesn't seem to understand my argument that ATMOSPHERIC CO2 has no direct relationship to fossil fuel consumption, he lists the obvious fact that CO2 is released by the burning of fossil fuels, but shows no explanation to why an entire decade (and more) of data shows no relation between fossil fuel consumption and atmospheric CO2, in fact he drops the point in his second argument when he says he cannot explain why this statistic occurred. My opponent's second rebuttal states'My opponent seems to miss the original claim he/she made. I have shown that the overall trend is upwards. El nino was particularly potent in the spike of the graph.'I haven't forgotten any claims that I have made, however my opponent has not shown anything contrary to my original claim, his only counter argument negates his entire argument when my opponent blames the spike in temperature on El Nino, a climate feature unrelated to Global Warming. But again even I admitted there was a slight warming trend since 1978, but if the El Nino spike is removed from the data the trend disappears, so my opponent admits that Global Warming is not the cause of the temperature since 1978. My opponent's third rebuttal states 'The overall tend is hotter. Climate can be difficult to predict, just because not everything predicted came true at the correct time, doesn't destroy the overall premise is false.'However I have shown 3 different examples of a lack of an overall warming trend. My first example being my 1st chart on my first argument, which shows that GLOBALLY the overall warming trend (that there is) is 'statistically insignificant' (since 1978). My second example shows that in the US temperatures are cooling over the last decade. My third example shows that in the North and East Atlantic Ocean, as well as, the British Isles have not experienced any warming. My opponent's fourth rebuttal states'The graph clearly indicates that Co2 and temperature show a strong positive relationship. Yes, there are a few anomalies but that doesn't discredit the theory.'My opponent has offered one singular graph showing a relationship between CO2 and temperature. However, I have pointed out that there are events on his graph that shows an independence between the two variables, on top of this, I have offered TWICE as much evidence in the contrary, which my opponent has neglected to mention, showing independence between the two variables even over millions of years. Again I'd like to crystalize my arguments1: Fossil Fuels do not cause an increase in CO2 emissions, which makes the first part of the IPCC's basic version of global warming invalidMy opponent has not other a sufficient refutation for this argument, because this point refutes the definition of Global Warming, it proves that, as we are debating it, Global Warming is not real and thus not a threat.2: Despite common belief the last few years have not been the warmest on record... My opponent calls this point 'cherry picking' however as I have proven, this is not true, and because my opponent has not offered contrary evidence and because of that this point still stands3: Antarctic Ice was larger than ever in 2012 and 2014, thus the Antarctic Ice caps have not been melting which is thought to be a sideffect of the Global Warming theoryMy opponent's first reputation was to say that the ice caps would not melt if Global Warming occurred, however I have shown that this is false, then my opponent made a refutation that is not in contradiction to anything that I stated, so this point still stands.4: There is no direct link between CO2 Emissions and Temperature IncreasesMy opponent has neglected to mention either of my graphs and my opponent's evidence has been refuted making this point still relevant in this debate. Now I'd like to show why I have won this debate My opponent's arguments have been proven false or a fallacy. My opponent's first 'point' is the pope's quote which I've shown to be worth no value to this debate, and I have proven it to be a bandwagon fallacy. My opponent's second point is the Inconvenient Truth Movie which posits scientific evidence for the theory of Global Warming, However, my entire case is in direct contradiction to this movie and acts as counter evidence and a rebuttal to the movie. So, because both of my opponent's arguments have been proven wrong, and my opponent's refutations have been untrue and unfounded, and I have proven them to be so, Thus, I have won this debate... Judges must vote in favor of the Con because of the overwhelming amount of evidence presented and the lack of evidence for my opponent.  I'd like to thank my opponent for this fun and enlightening debate.</t>

    <t>RebuttalsFirst my arguments still stand. I think everyone already knows the Pope is not a climate change scientist. Opponent's arguments.1. Fossil Fuels do not cause an increase in CO2 emissions, which makes the first part of the IPCC's basic version of global warming invalidThis is overtly false, since science has shown repeatably that CO2 emissions increase green house gases. This is also stage 3c of climate change denial. [3]'The main human activity that emits CO2 is the combustion of fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, and oil) for energy and transportation' [2]From the above statement you can clearly see that burning oil causes green house gases. Why CO2 levels happen to drop that year is uncertain. Yet, from your own graph, you can see that CO2 levels are increasing dramatically. Argument 2 Despite common belief the last few years have not been the warmest on recordArgument two is cherry picking. El nino was responsible for the height of the graph. This is 1b stage of climate change denial and a logical fallacy. Argument 3 Antarctic Ice was larger than ever in 2012 and 2014, thus the Antarctic Ice caps have not been melting which is thought to be a sideffect of the Global Warming theoryAntarctica ice is 1b stage of climate change denial. [3]'First, any argument that tries to use a regional phenomenon to disprove a global trend is dead in the water. Anthropogenic global warming theory does not predict uniform warming throughout the globe. We need to assess the balance of the evidence.''Second, ice-sheet thickening is not inconsistent with warming! Warmer climates tend toward more precipitation. The Antarctic is one of the most extreme deserts on the planet. As it warms, we would expect it to receive more snow. But even a whopping warming of 20 degrees ' say, from -50 degrees C to -30 degrees C ' would still leave it below freezing, so the snow wouldn't melt. Thus, an increase in ice mass.'As you can see your Antarctica ice argument provides supporting evidence global climate change is happening. [5]4: There is no direct link between CO2 Emissions and Temperature IncreasesThis is stage 3c of climate change denial. [3]''When viewed coarsely, historical CO2 levels and temperature show a tight correlation. However, a closer examination of the CH4, CO2, and temperature fluctuations recorded in the Antarctic ice core records reveals that, yes, temperature moved first.Nevertheless, it is misleading to say that temperature rose and then, hundreds of years later, CO2 rose. These warming periods lasted for 5,000 to 10,000 years (the cooling periods lasted more like 100,000 years!), so for the majority of that time (90% and more), temperature and CO2 rose together. 'show picture of graph if possible.' [6][7]Antartica ice provides supporting evidence due to increase snow fall in sub freezing tempatures. Phew, made me work for the victory.

Argument one, burning of fossil fuels increase Co2.I've shown that the EPA states that burning of fossil fuels increase the greenhouse gas of CO2. I was unable to figure out why CO2 levels dropped during the time interval of 1940-1950. Yet, I did show that by my opponent's same graph CO2 levels have risen dramatically. In 1850 with Co2 at 285.2 ppm and in the year 2011 391.15 ppm. This is a cherry picking fallacy, my opponent has chosen a time frame that best suits him/her despite the obvious overall trend of higher concentrations of CO2.'The two main byproducts of natural gas combustion are carbon dioxide and water vapor' [8]As you can see the combustion of natural gas causes carbon dioxide, Co2 emissions. 2.

    <t>Global warming is caused by the emission of greenhouse gases . 72% of the totally emitted greenhouse gases is carbon dioxide (CO2), 18% Methane and 9% Nitrous oxide (NOx). Carbon dioxide emissions therefore are the most important cause of global warming. CO2 is inevitably created by burning fuels like e.g. oil, natural gas, diesel, organic-diesel, petrol, organic-petrol, ethanol. The emissions of CO2 have been dramatically increased within the last 50 years and are still increasing by almost 3% each year, see graph below:      Word-wide CO2 emission are steadily increasingGraph 1: CO2-emissions world-wide by year (data from wri.org)  World-wide CO2 emissions and concentrationsGraph 2: CO2 emissions world-wide by year and CO2 concentration in the atmosphere by year  The carbon dioxide is released to the atmosphere where it remains for 100 to 200 years. This leads to an increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere (see above on the right hand side), which in turn causes the average temperature on Earth to raise (see graph below).  Increase of world temperature Chart 3: Increase of global average temperature for the last 20 years (source: wri.org) Recent investigations have shown that inconceivable catastrophic changes in the environment will take place if the global temperatures increase by more than 2° C (3.6° F).

    <t>In fact, over the last decade, the rate of climate change has been declining, despite the fact that we use more Co2 emitting energy sources. Now, I believe that Co2 has a small effect on the climate, but there is simply no evidence saying that we will die. And fossil fuels can be used to make countries stronger in the face of the effects some scientists hypothesise will effect them the most. for instance, fossil fuels can actually be used to make stronger structures and communities that can easily bounce back from devastating natural disasters. For instance, there is a correlation between fossil fuel and clean water, this is because fossil fuel can be used to power refineries and the entire pipe system used to get water to the tap. Now, of course all this energy can be found in other energy sources, such as nuclear and hydroelectric, but I suppose that you want to talk about wind and solar right? After all they are free supposedly? Well, not true, in fact, it is quite pricy, just to get the rare resources to make solar panels. But in inclusion to the solar panels and wind power, you'd need a reliable alternate. After all, the sun isn't shining all the time and the wind isn't blowing all the time. This is why despite the fact that Germany has invested so much in solar and wind energy, they have more coal plants then ever. And this in turn has caused some to go in to 'energy poverty' I hope this clears up why we can't elect a president with no experience just because of climate change.  Now, I'd like to talk about the flaws in Jills other plans. She would like to raise taxes on the rich. Of course this sound like a great plan, after all, virtually everyone (including me) thinks the rich should pay their fair share. But the top 10% already pay 70% of government funding. And not only that, but research shows that the laffer curve for the rich indicated that the revenue collected from them INCREACES then taxes on them are DECREASED. Weird right? Well it turns out that when the rich know that less of their money is going to govt, they are far more willing to spend it. This also often indicates that they are putting money into their business, meaning they are probably hiring more people. And luckily for me Gary Johnsons tax plan will allow this to happen.  And again, Jills environmental plan was tried in Germany, and as I said, failed.  Her minimun wage of $15 will put far to may people out of work.

    <t>With the environment becoming increasingly an issue I think its a high time we elect a green party representative. The fact that Jill is both a woman and a Harvard graduate aids her. This is because she will be the first woman president if elected. I think it is high time we break the trend of all male presidents. A Harvard degree is no small task. 'She graduated magna cum laude from Harvard College in 1973, and from Harvard Medical School in 1979.' [0]Compare this to Gary Johnson's degree from the university of New Mexico. 'While studying at the University of New Mexico, Gov. Johnson started a handyman business as means to achieve financial independence. After graduating with a degree in political science in 1975, his company, Big J Enterprises, expanded into remodeling and renovation, and eventually, construction. ' [1]Therefore, there are three areas in which Jill has an advantage over Gary. First she focuses more on the enviorment than Gary. Second, she is a woman, which would make her the first female president. Third, she has a more prestigious degree than Johnson. Why is the environment so important? If we don't act soon, as early as 2034 climate change will be out of control. Meaning only a supreme being could save the human race at that point. 'in fact, the report shows we might exceed a 2 C increase as early as 2034.' [2]We have to act now. The end of days is upon us unless we get our acts together. There can be no liberty, justice, nor freedom for anyone under such conditions. Nevertheless, there is plenty of climate change deniers. Both in elected offices and the masses. [3]'63% of those with no post-school qualifications were unconvinced about the role of humans in producing climate changeUniversity graduates were much more likely to take the opposite view, with 86% agreeing that human activity was responsible' [4]This means 37% of people with no post-school qualifications don't believe in man made climate change. This is huge, we need to bring awareness to as many people as possible and act accordingly. Pope Francis believes climate change is a threat and so do scientists. Meanwhile, Gary seems to take a weak stance on environmental issues. If nothing else electing Jill Stein will send a strong message that climate change is real. The time to act is now before it is too late. </t>

    <t>Pros for JohnsonI would like to first talk about Johnson's time as a republican. While I normally don't find it important to bring up, but people often bring it up, but Johnson's achievements as a Republican are not meaningless just because he is now a Libertarian, for as a republican, Johnson upheld a strictly Libertarian sort of Raegan Coolidge like platform, so nothing really changed except party. Now I would like to talk about his time as governer of New Mexico. He achieved a huge approval ration in a state where democrats out number republicans 2 to 1. He also left a statte previously struggling terribly with budget problems with a huge $1 billion budget surpluss. He also constructed two privately funded prisons, meaning the government doesn't pay for it. He vetoes more costly bills then all other governers combined. He also started a major road building program and shifted medicaid to a more efficient managed care. I think that these show that Johnson would be a very solid choice for presidentCons for Jill Stein Unlike a debate between Ms. Clinton and Mr. Trump, I speculate that this debate will mostly be left up to the pros, not the cons. I can't really criticize Jill Stein to much because she has never held an elective office. Which simply leaves me with lack of experience. We can't simply let someone who has little to no knowledge of how to work in government.  And Jill Stein graduating Harvard cannot be used to soldify her claims, as no political courses were taken, and she only took medical related courses.</t>

    <t>I'm not against having a woman, but I always stand by having the most qualified person do the job, and that making sure we have a woman president shouldn't be our top priority. Now your claim that Jill Stein has a more prestigious degree is true in fact, but agin, its not a political degree, meanwhile Gary Johnson has a degree in political science. Would you hire a Harvard medical doctor as a lawyer? No, of course not, you would want someone who has a degree in the given field, right?  And the environmental claims are one field, and an iffy field at that. The environment is something extremely hard to predict, and science often predicts it wrong. And while I don't personally believe that man made climate change is as big as you stated, but we do have an $8,000,000,000 department called the Environmental Protection Agency.  Now onto the aspects that Jill loses to Gary Johnson, other than having no political degree and has never holding elective office. First, Gary Johnson will be for better at improving our economy, he would implement the same acts as he did while governor of New Mexico, which left the horribly budgeted state with a huge surplus. Jill has not proven herself prominent in this category, again, because she is not experienced. She also fails to address Americas terrible budget problem. The congressional budget office states that by the end of the 2016 FY, Congress will have gone $534 billion over there budget, as usual. What has Jill agreed to do?</t>

    <t>Your lack of rebuttals makes me think you're stumped. You only responded to one thing I said because you think it is the only important thing I said, and didn't even bother to bring up the evidence I used to support it. You simply said that Co2 levels are higher then we expected. Which is not what I said was expected, what I said is that a warming trend is expected, as we have recently entered an inter galacial period as part of the paleostine ice age. You see, the climate is constantly changing, and my point was that the Co2 theory is becoming more and more flawed. Now you bring up hurricanes, again, this is all part of the warming trend. And anyway, if you really do want to help countries in danger because of hurricanes, then you are on the wrong path. When a developed country gets hit by a hurricane, the effects are far less devastating than when a hurricane or typhoon hits a less developed country. Mainly because of low quality shelter. This causes that country's economy to crash. So if you are really concerned about hurricane damage, then get of the problem of climate change, and focus on bringing those countries out of poverty.  Now on to your claim of Co2 levels. Now, the term carbon emissions is wrong, as it is not just carbon, but carbon dioxide. And every single form of fossil fuel is made of it, and all of that Co2 was once in our atmosphere. And for most of our planets existence, Co2 levels were far higher than they are today. Now, Co2 levels cannot be used to blame your stated problems on. For instance, low plant growth, if anything, can be blamed on low Co2 levels, as the optimal level for plant growth is 4x higher then ours today. And our high levels of Co2, as noted by satellite imagery, are actually making the Earth greener in terms of plant growth, as plants and forests begin to regrow at noticeably fast rates.  Now, I have made legitimate claims and backed them up accordingly, and I would appreciate it if you acknowledge these claims, instead of cherry picking for one group of words to attack.</t>

YatesuniWhat are you talking about? Co2 levels are higher than expected. You provide no outside links on this subject. ' The last time there was this much carbon dioxide (CO2) in the Earth's atmosphere, modern humans didn't exist. Megatoothed sharks prowled the oceans, the world's seas were up to 100 feet higher than they are today, and the global average surface temperature was up to 11°F warmer than it is now.As we near the record for the highest CO2 concentration in human history — 400 parts per million — climate scientists worry about where we were then, and where we're rapidly headed now.' [2]As you can see we are about to break the record for highest CO2 concentrations in human history 400 parts per million. All signs indicates the concentration will get higher and higher. Your claim about plants growing faster is also flawed. 'But an unprecedented three-year experiment conducted at Stanford University is raising questions about that long-held assumption. Writing in the journal Science, researchers concluded that elevated atmospheric CO2 actually reduces plant growth when combined with other likely consequences of climate change -- namely, higher temperatures, increased precipitation or increased nitrogen deposits in the soil. ' [3]You dispute mainstream science and popular opinion with weak arguments. Meanwhile human population is still above 7 billion.

    <t>I would like to thank my opponent for the opportunity to be able to debate this fascinating topic. I have only debates on this subject before in a debate talking about the 97% statistic, and for the sake of time, I will leave a link to that to explain why the 97% statistic is untrue. Now onto the rest. Science is highly unreliable when in the climate sphere. Back in the 70s virtually every scientist agreed that we were going into a massive ice age, and now they have flip flopped and now think the globe is warming. Science has been doing this forever, one weakly supported claim is said so much that it basically becomes fact. Also, reliable science shows that we are coming out of a minor ige age. So this warming trend it natural. Also, the climate is constantly changing, and it has been doing so since it was formed billions of years ago. For us to think that it is controllable or that we caused it is completely unethical. My whole point is that science argues more against climate change then for it, and it's not that hard to understand, its really common sense.  Also, I understand that ice is melting and sea levels are rising. But a recent study shows that while arctic sea ice is melting antarctic sea ice is expanding. Another study shows that the sea level rise rate has decreased.  And your comment to the pope is completely irrational. The Pope's opinion is not fact, just because he is a figure head for the Catholic church doesn't mean he speaks for it. You can be Catholic and still disagree with what the pope says.  Basically, science says that the warming trend is natural and expected, we are coming out of a little ice age and we will be fine, the Roman Warm period was warmer and they had no carbon emissions to blame it on, just because things are changing and the public didn't know enough to expect it doesn't mean we blame it on something based on the first half-baked argument we hear.</t>

    <t>The greenhouse effect is a thing, and hypothetically it would raise temperatures. But adding more and more to our atmosphere does not infinitely raise the temperature, it only raises it to an extent. Yet again I see you have ignored the very important claim that we are coming out of a galatial period, which explains the warming trend, and everything you think it has caused.  Also, few climate scientists actually worry where we are headed, those are environmental activists, corrupt politicians, and a few scientists hired specifically to prove it is man made. In most cases, you will see that studies that indicate a rapid change are botched, as seen in my 97% debate.  And may I ask you some questions you are free to answer in the comments, what have you done. Are you yelling about a problem you are part of? Do you drive an electric car? Do you plant? Have you actually gone out as I have and contribute to a worthy solution?  And what does population have anything to do with climate change?  Also, may I end with an argument that I may have benifited from starting with. The only constant is change. When the media makes these claims, they leave so much out of the picture. As you have done with my arguments. They take one thing, leave out the rest, which makes it easy to destroy its foundation. If we actually see the whole picture, and know the problem for what it is, then we can come up with actual solutions that can make an actual change. Not just weak EPA political action.

    <t>Thanks for the debate and good luck!  My opponent unfortunately makes some shallow assumptions, in that they believe Donald Trump legitimately believes everything he's said. Remember, my opponent has the burden of proof, and as such must prove beyond reasonable doubt that Trump actually believes this during the course of this debate. Failure to do so means a lack of his fulfillment of his burden of proof and thus means the negative wins the debate. I don't need to show that Trump DOESN'T believe this, just show that there isn't enough evidence to demonstrate that he does. I can further explain the burden of proof in a later round if this becomes an issue or is confusing somehow, but I'll leave this where it is for now and move onto my main contentions.  As I said earlier, my opponent just quotes Trump at face value and assumes that is enough to assert that this is what he believes. However, it's a well known fact that politicians in general will fake beliefs to pander to a specific audience. Looking back at his history as a candidate, it's common knowledge that Trump already had his supporters locked down early in the republican primaries and really couldn't do anything to lose his supporters, even claiming he could shoot someone in the middle of the road and not lose support. A potential reason for him faking belief in climate change then could be to pander to Cruz supporters, of which only 38% believed in climate change. This is a clear reason for Trump to pander to a specific audience in order to get votes, which gives us a motivation for Trump's actions. Trump even has told people that he has a strategy of saying odd things in order to attract the audience of different groups. Take for example what Carson reported after discussing the matter with Trump himself: 'I needed to know that he could listen to other people, that he could change his opinions, and that some of the more outlandish things that he's said, that he didn't really believe those things,' Carson said. When asked which statements Trump might back away from, Carson demurred'. 'I'll let him talk about that because I don't think it's fair for me to relay a private conversation,' he said. How can my opponent say for certain that Trump fully believes this if there's evidence of him saying that he'll back away from some of the more outlandish claims, and that he doesn't necessarily believe all of it? My opponent even recognized in the comments section that this is a somewhat outlandish and silly claim for Trump to make. We've seen Trump back away from policies such as the muslim ban, so why assume that this is his actual belief? Unfortunately my opponent uses mostly personal speculation and does not consider the large body of compelling evidence casting doubt over Trump's actual beliefs.  With that I'll give pro a chance to respond to my contentions. Thank you!</t>

    <t>Addressing the first prong of my argument concerning the leftward lean of journalists generally and the St. Petersburg/Tampa Bay Times specifically, Conservative Democrat wrote:  '(T)his doesn't prove that PoliticFact [sic] is biased unless we have other evidence as well.'  The debate challenge does not ask for proof. The debate challenge asks whether PolitiFact has a liberal bias. The bias among journalists and at PolitiFact's parent newspaper offer reasonable grounds for thinking PolitiFact leans left. The first prong is not meant as proof, for the debate challenge does not require proof.  It's a bit late to amend the rules of the debate, such as they are.  Addressing my second prong, regarding PolitiFact's failure to provide a principled distinction between its 'False' and 'Pants on Fire' ratings, Conservative Democrat wrote:  'No, they did state why they give some claims False and some Pants on Fire. (...) For example; False claim: I am leading over my opponent in Poll A - But you were not leading; Pants on Fire: I am leading in every poll - But your opponent actually is beating you in many polls.'  Where I inserted the ellipsis, Conservative Democrat simply repeated the description of the ratings like one I had already supplied. The remainder of Conservative Democrat's answer offers example as a substitute for principle. But why is a string of wrong statements not merely wrong but in addition 'ridiculous'? PolitiFact never states any such difference in terms of principle. When pressed on the matter during a 2014 podcast interview, PolitiFact editor Angie Drobnic Holan said '(T)he line between 'False' and 'Pants on Fire' is just, you know, sometimes we decide one way and sometimes decide the other' (1). Her statement does not provide any principled distinction between one rating and the other.  Providing an example in rebuttal without identifying the principle in the example counts as a failed rebuttal.  Again addressing the second prong, this time in terms of the PolitiFact's tendency to more likely grade Republican false statements 'Pants on Fire' than those of Democrats, Conservative Democrat wrote (accounting for the next few sections of quoted text):  'Regardless of whether the rating is subjective or not, there is still a reason for this.'  If the reasons follow no objective principle then the ratings are effectively subjective and the disparity in the ratings shows PolitiFact's liberal bias.  'Republicans are generally more religious then liberals, so many don't believe in evolution.'  PolitiFact rarely rates claims touching the issue of evolution. If Conservative Democrat can offer as much as one example of such rated 'Pants on Fire' then the point would be at least slightly interesting. But even then it does not turn my third prong.  'Many also don't believe in Global Warming.'  Conservative Democrat might have cited that factoid to PolitiFact. Unfortunately, the example plays to my advantage in this debate. PolitiFact does not bring scientific rigor to its ratings on global warming, and in fact sometimes reverses its rating principles on the topic. PolitiFact uses a 'burden of proof' standard in its statement of principles. If politician does not support a claim and PolitiFact cannot support it with evidence, PolitiFact calls the claim false (2). Yet a Democrat can say 'It is true that there's virtually no Republican who accepts the science that virtually is unanimous' and PolitiFact gives it a 'Mostly True' rating despite the fact that most Republicans have offered no statement of their beliefs on climate change (3). PolitiFact will sometimes simply trash its own principles in favor of a popular public narrative. When a Republican does not offer a position on climate change, does it follow that the Republican does not accept the science? Is that logical? When a fact-checker abandons its principles to favor one side of a debate, it's a solid sign of bias.  '(M)ore Republicans will get fact checked, so more of them will make 'Pants on Fire' statements.'  The research takes that into account. It does not look merely at which party receives more 'Pants on Fire' ratings but instead at which party's false statements are more likely to receive 'Pants on Fire' statements. If the proportions were equal, Republicans could have 20 times more 'Pants on Fire' statements but the research would show no evidence of bias by that measure. Conservative Democrat misstates the nature of the evidence.  'Liberals are generally more intelligent then conservatives'  What's the relevance, other than affording the opportunity to use a citation? If it's not relevant, it's not an intelligent move to include that factoid.  'So why would the apparently liberal PoliticFact [sic] allow PoliticFact [sic] Wisconsin to not be liberally biased? What is more likely is that the claims Wisconsin Democrats make are more likely to be false then the Republican statements.'  How would PolitiFact National stop PolitiFact Wisconsin from favoring Republicans in its selections of 'Pants on Fire' statements? There's no use asking why if there's no how. The notion that Wisconsin Democrats are more likely to make false statements lacks any evidence in support (using PolitiFact statistics would beg the question), and more importantly Conservative Democrat should note that both 'False' and 'Pants on Fire' ratings supposedly indicate false statements. It doesn't solve the mystery to say that Wisconsin Democrats more likely make more false claims. That's irrelevant to a disparity in the chances of the application of the 'Pants on Fire' rating.  Turning attention to the third prong of my argument, Conservative Democrat wrote:  'First off, PoliticFact didn't use, 'The wrong denominator nine times.' Your source says they miscalculated 9 times.'  There's no discrepancy. Using the wrong denominator results in a miscalculation of percentage error (4). My source says as much, but in different words ('It is incorrect to divide by the incorrect estimate, 175 lbs' (5)). The thing you divide by is the denominator.  'If this site was liberally biased, why even allow the republicans any bonuses?'  That was explained. Wrong procedures by poor fact checkers are more likely to favor the fact-checker's ideology. 'More likely' does not mean 'exclusively.' Lack of bias would mean no pattern of one party receiving more unfair harm than the other. Any other understanding represents a straw man.  'we don't get any links to the miscalcuations [sic].  The source links to a spreadsheet that identifies every case in question.  'There were 6 calculation errors (apparently) that helped Democrats. This means they have a .9% chance of making an error in favor of a Democrat.'  That statement shows a lack of understanding of the research. The search strand provided a suitably random sample of PolitiFact's work looking for one type of calculation. A sample looking for special cases. Your conclusion doesn't follow at all.  'Look at the democratic chart on this website. That hardly looks like they are helping democrats much.'  That's unresponsive to the point. We have no baseline from which to judge the fairness of the charts. Your opinion is only evidence of your opinion. Maybe the Democrats made more false claims.  Conservative Democrat dealt briefly with my fourth prong:  'A) You didn't show how this is a liberal bias.'  Did. 'If PolitiFact National's worst work favors Democrats over Republicans, then it serves as an evidence of PolitiFact National's liberal bias.'  'B) You are focusing on an unrelated part of this fact check.'  Biased fact-checkers are more likely to commit and sustain a blunder that agrees with their bias. How is that not related?  'C) This is out of context.'  Based on what evidence? How can rising costs ever reduce a deficit in any context?  'Government spending stimulates the economy.'  The only way that could lead to deficit reduction is when taxes are collected on the increased economic activity (revenue, just like I said). But you don't get back more than you spend, do you?  'D) Again, what does this mean? You didn't explain how this proves a liberal bias.'  Do I need to repeat myself? PolitiFact's apparent incompetence favored the liberal position. I don't need proof. I just need reasonable evidence, as I've already explained.  As this stage of the debate shows, Conservative Democrat has failed to refute any prong of my argument. PolitiFact's institutional bias probabilistically shows a liberal bias, two research projects show strong evidence of PolitiFact's liberal bias, and Conservative Democrat has no counter to my anecdotes.  Conservative Democrat summarized: 'So of these 4, you failed to back up 2 of them, one of these 'biases' is out of context, and the other one is nitpicking.'  I've explained why each of your criticisms ring hollow.  'It is not my job to prove PoliticFact [sic] is not biased, when no evidence to the contrary exists.'  I said that if you do not refute each prong of my argument then you need your own affirmative evidence. That's perfectly true, despite your (straw man) hint that I improperly shift the burden of proof. You haven't refuted any part of my argument (evidence in my reply above), nor have you provided your own affirmative case. Based on our arguments, it is reasonable to conclude that PolitiFact has a liberal bias. All of the evidence is on my side.</t>
<h>    Addressing the first prong of my argument concerning the leftward lean of journalists generally and the St. Petersburg/Tampa Bay Times specifically.</h>
  </pair>
  <pair id="90" entailment="ENTAILMENT" task="IE">
    <t>I offer thanks to 'Conservative Democrat' for extending this challenge. PolitiFact's leftward lean does not yet receive the full attention it deserves, so I appreciate the opportunity to make the case.  The fact checkers at PolitiFact, referring to PolitiFact National, have a liberal bias. My argument will make this clear based on a preponderance of the evidence. While that should prove sufficient for the argument to succeed based on the terms of the debate, this argument should also convince the audience beyond a reasonable doubt that PolitiFact National has a liberal bias.  What's the evidence?  First, American journalists as a group are to the left of the general U.S. population (1). Second, PolitiFact was created by the St. Petersburg Times (now the Tampa Bay Times), a newspaper with a notable history of partiality to the left. For example, the newspaper has never in over 100 years endorsed a Republican in the general presidential election (2). The most important evidence, though, comes from PolitiFact's content, not from the likely predispositions of its writers and editors or the editorial history of its parent newspaper. Three lines of evidence together make a strong case that the liberal lean at the Times manifests itself in PolitiFact's fact checking. The first two lines come from research. The third derives from PolitiFact's poorest attempts at fact-checking, which tend to unfairly harm Republicans while sparing Democrats.  The first research project (3) uses PolitiFact's rating scale to show unjustified harm to Republicans compared to Democrats. The research focuses on the difference between the 'False' and 'Pants on Fire' Truth-O-Meter ratings.  A continuing research project I designed provides a powerful evidence of the bias at PolitiFact National. PolitiFact's failure to provide any objective means of distinguishing between its 'False' and 'Pants on Fire' ratings strongly suggests the ratings reflect an editorial opinion about select statements PolitiFact finds false. PolitiFact decides its ratings based on the vote of three (possibly more) editors (4). The research project randomly surveyed about a quarter of PolitiFact's 'Pants on Fire' ratings in search of an unstated objective principle justifying the ratings. The findings showed nothing close to a consistent result, supporting the hypothesis that PolitiFact has no objective justification backing its 'Pants on Fire' ratings (5).  The 2012 study showed the apparently subjective 'Pants on Fire' rating was 74 percent more likely to fall on a Republican false statement than a Democrat false statement, covering the years from 2007 through 2011. At the end of 2014, updated statistics showed that Republicans were still 74 percent more likely to have their false (by PolitiFact's reckoning) statements rated 'Pants on Fire' than those of Democrats (6).  The same research approach was applied to other PolitiFact franchises, including its state and 'PunditFact' franchises. The franchises that deliver the most robust volume of data show fairly consistent trends which do not necessarily track with the trend at PolitiFact National. PolitiFact Wisconsin, for example, tends to give Democrats' false statements harsher treatment than those from Republicans by more likely giving them the 'Pants on Fire' designation (7).  The other research project was based on reasoning that journalists could be expected to make a common math error more often in cases where the error favored their ideology. Using the often-made error of using the wrong denominator when calculating percentage error, the research project used a search routine to collect a set of PolitiFact stories that might contain percentage error calculations. The research approach turned up a small sample of stories with that equation present, yet the results were lopsided. Out of 14 examples reasonably classified as percentage error calculations, PolitiFact used the wrong denominator nine times (8).  Out of those nine errors, six either unfairly harmed a Republican or helped a Democrat. Three either helped a Republican or harmed a Democrat (9).  The third line of evidence comes from an examination of PolitiFact National's poorest work. If PolitiFact National's worst work favors Democrats over Republicans, then it serves as an evidence of PolitiFact National's liberal bias. The strength of that evidence depends on the strength of the anecdotes offered in illustration. I'll provide examples as space allows.  A) PolitiFact Florida ruled that a Republican candidate raised his own pay a number of times while serving in the U.S. House of Representatives (10) A later parallel fact check by PolitiFact Ohio rated a Republican candidate's claim that his Democratic opponent had raised his own pay in the House. The reason? PolitiFact Ohio correctly said the rules prevent representatives from raising their own pay (11). Though it involves PolitiFact Florida, this example contributes to the argument because the writer (Louis Jacobson) principally writes for PolitiFact National (12).  B) A PolitiFact defense of the ACA absurdly counted the ACA's projected deficit reductions as spending cuts to help justify rating the ad of a conservative group 'False.' PolitiFact claimed the Congressional Budget Office said the ACA would cut spending by $124 billion (13). But the CBO actually said the ACA would cut the budget deficit by $124 billion (14). Spending is not the same as the budget deficit. This PolitiFact Florida item was written by Angie Drobnic Holan, now chief editor at PolitiFact.  C) PolitiFact found it 'Mostly True' President Obama's claim that health care was the single biggest factor driving down the budget deficit, despite the fact that health care costs were increasing (15). The only things that can shrink the budget deficit are costs that drop or revenues that go up. Slowing the growth of a category of costs does not decrease the budget deficit (16).  D) During one of his State of the Union addresses, President Obama mentioned the 23-cent gender wage gap, called it 'wrong' and said women deserve equal pay for equal work. PolitiFact ruled that Obama was correct that a 23-cent wage gap exists, docking him only for an apples-to-oranges aspect of the statistic. PolitiFact said Obama's call for equal pay for equal work was not part of his gender pay gap claim, excusing the former as 'aspirational' (17). The Washington Post Fact Checker disagreed, finding Obama implied the gap was relevant to gender discrimination (18).  In the space remaining, I'll address the argument that PolitiFact gives Republicans worse rating as a group than Democrats.  By itself, more poor ratings for Republicans says essentially nothing about bias at PolitiFact. Bad ratings for Republicans might occur because Republicans make more false statements. However, when we consider Republicans' poor record with PolitiFact in context, it serves as an additional, albeit weak, evidence of PolitiFact's liberal bias.  It is important to note that we have no scientifically supported baseline for which political party makes more false claims. So when PolitiFact rates Republicans more harshly than Democrats, it supports no reasonable prediction about PolitiFact's ratings matching a known tendency. On the other hand, knowing that journalists lean left makes it reasonable to predict that if that bias affects PolitiFact's ratings then it may result in harsher ratings for Republicans. The harsh ratings for Republicans support a prediction associated with the hypothesis that PolitiFact has a liberal bias.  So, it is reasonable to conclude that PolitiFact has a liberal bias because journalists tend to lean left, two research approaches support the idea, and PolitiFact's most glaring mistakes tend to unfairly harm Republicans or aid Democrats.  Conservative Democrat will need to either refute each prong of the argument or instead provide affirmative evidence of either PolitiFact's neutrality or its conservative bias, otherwise it is more reasonable to accept that PolitiFact has a liberal bias.  Thanks again to Conservative Democrat for issuing this challenge.</t>

    <t>Thank you for accepting! I hope we can have an interesting discussion.  'First, American journalists as a group are to the left of the general U.S. population (1). Second, PolitiFact was created by the St. Petersburg Times (now the Tampa Bay Times), a newspaper with a notable history of partiality to the left. For example, the newspaper has never in over 100 years endorsed a Republican in the general presidential election.' - True this may be, but this doesn't prove that PoliticFact is biased unless we have other evidence as well.  'The findings showed nothing close to a consistent result, supporting the hypothesis that PolitiFact has no objective justification backing its 'Pants on Fire' ratings.' -No, they did state why they give some claims False and some Pants on Fire. They give False to statements that are just wrong, but not ridiculous. They give Pants on Fire to claims that are ridiculous and wrong. For example; False claim: I am leading over my opponent in Poll A - But you were not leading; Pants on Fire: I am leading in every poll - But your opponent actually is beating you in many polls. 'The 2012 study showed the apparently subjective 'Pants on Fire' rating was 74 percent more likely to fall on a Republican false statement than a Democrat false statement, covering the years from 2007 through 2011. At the end of 2014, updated statistics showed that Republicans were still 74 percent more likely to have their false (by PolitiFact's reckoning) statements rated 'Pants on Fire' than those of Democrats (6). - Regardless of whether the rating is subjective or not, there is still a reason for this. Republicans are generally more religious then liberals, so many don't believe in evolution. Many also don't believe in Global Warming. PoliticFact believes those things are true, so they rate those claims accordingly. Another thing to consider, there are more Republicans then Democrats in congress, so more Republicans will get fact checked, so more of them will make 'Pants on Fire' statements. Republicans probably make more bogus claims, so they will get fact checked more.  'The same research approach was applied to other PolitiFact franchises, including its state and 'PunditFact' franchises. The franchises that deliver the most robust volume of data show fairly consistent trends which do not necessarily track with the trend at PolitiFact National. PolitiFact Wisconsin, for example, tends to give Democrats' false statements harsher treatment than those from Republicans by more likely giving them the 'Pants on Fire' designation (7).' - Liberals are generally more intelligent then conservatives. So why would the apparently liberal PoliticFact allow PoliticFact Wisconsin to not be liberally biased? What is more likely is that the claims Wisconsin Democrats make are more likely to be false then the Republican statements.' 'The other research project was based on reasoning that journalists could be expected to make a common math error more often in cases where the error favored their ideology.

Out of 14 examples reasonably classified as percentage error calculations, PolitiFact used the wrong denominator nine times. Out of those nine errors, six either unfairly harmed a Republican or helped a Democrat. Three either helped a Republican or harmed a Democrat.' -First off, PoliticFact didn't use, 'The wrong denominator nine times.' Your source says they miscalculated 9 times. It also says that of these 14 claims, 2 were ambiguous, and 3 were correct. So we are down to 9 miscalculations. And of those, 3 helped republicans. If this site was liberally biased, why even allow the republicans any bonuses? Plus, we don't get any links to the miscalcuations, probably because PoliticFact fixed their errors, like any site would. Next, PolitiFact has done at least 1000 fact checks. There were 6 calculation errors (apparently) that helped Democrats. This means they have a .9% chance of making an error in favor of a Democrat. That doesn't seem biased at all. Also, your source is 'PolitiFactBias.' That doesn't seem like an unbiased source.  'It is important to note that we have no scientifically supported baseline for which political party makes more false claims. So when PolitiFact rates Republicans more harshly than Democrats, it supports no reasonable prediction about PolitiFact's ratings matching a known tendency. On the other hand, knowing that journalists lean left makes it reasonable to predict that if that bias affects PolitiFact's ratings then it may result in harsher ratings for Republicans. The harsh ratings for Republicans support a prediction associated with the hypothesis that PolitiFact has a liberal bias.' -Look at the democratic chart on this website. That hardly looks like they are helping democrats much. Just under 1/2 of the democratic claims are 1/2 false, mostly false, false, and pants on fire. The republican circle is much more to the negative, but as the source points out, there are many Republicans that make ridiculous claims, and those people are quite popular, so they will get fact checked. A) You didn't show how this is a liberal bias. B) You are focusing on an unrelated part of this fact check. Anyway, their point is that this legislation won't cost as much as the Republicans were saying. C) This is out of context. Read the fact check. They are saying that healthcare now will reduce the deficit in the long run. Plus, you just used this example in B, but now you are calling it false? Government spending stimulates the economy. D) Again, what does this mean? You didn't explain how this proves a liberal bias.  So of these 4, you failed to back up 2 of them, one of these 'biases' is out of context, and the other one is nitpicking.  So I believe I have rebutted your arguments. I see in your argument that you want me to provide evidence for my side. I don't need to do this. You have the burden of proof. It is not my job to prove PoliticFact is not biased, when no evidence to the contrary exists. If I worded the resolution as, 'PoliticFact is not liberally biased', I would have the BoP. But since you have the positive position, you have to prove your side.  Thank you for accepting! Good luck in the final round!</t>

    <t>I'm too lazy to write rules.  I have seen this multiple times; the website Politifact haas liberal bias. Evidence? They rate more claims by conservatives false then they do liberals. To me, this doesn't show any bias. It just shows more conservatives say false or ludicrous things. For example, Donald Trump is often fact checked, which will obviously increase the amount of false conservative claims. For example, Donald Trump believes climate change is a Chinese hoax. Liberals just don't say things like that on the same frequency as conservatives. Also, since our political spectrum is so far to the right, we don't see many insane far-left claims, because that position isn't represented in the media or by politicians. And since our spectrum is on the right, more conservatives will make claims then liberals, so more conservatives will get fact checked, as they have more claims. I believe I have madey point.

    <t>Environmental law has developed in response to emerging awareness and concern over issues impacting the globe. 'Beginning in the 1970s, Congress enacted a set of laws to protect the nation's air, water and lands from uncontrolled pollution. These laws responded to the consequences of unregulated industrial development that had fouled those resources to the point where rivers were not fishable, air was unhealthy to breathe, and land contamination put Love Canal at the forefront of national consciousness. Over time, environmental regulation has been very successful at reducing the amount of pollution Americans face every day' [1].  The Clean Air Act is the principle law addressing air pollution including carbon dioxide emissions. 'In 2002, a report by the Journal of American Medical Association credited the act's automobile emission regulations with reducing carbon monoxide related deaths, saving 11,700 lives between 1968 and 1998' [2]. Similarly, the Montreal Protocol Act could be preventing 11 billion tons of CO2 from entering Earth's atmosphere [3]. These laws have made it easier for people to breathe and are crucial to our well being.  President Nixon signed the Clean Water Act in 1972, the primary federal law addressing water quality standards for the nation's waterways. Most importantly, this act puts the onus on states to develop plans to protect their watersheds from non-point pollution [2]. Still, a 2009 study by Duke University concluded that while water quality has improved, 'population growth, limited jurisdiction, and unforeseen water stressors, such as emerging contaminants and climate change' nevertheless plague our waters. This means regulation and enforcement of those regulations is still very relevant to our health and the well-being of our planet.  We know that there is a great deal of stress on our environment that puts the livelihood of both animals and humans in danger. Yet people still tend to behave selfishly or in their own (financial) self-interest. 'The tragedy of the commons is an economic theory of a situation within a shared-resource system where individual users acting independently according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting that resource through their collective action' [4].  To prevent people from ruining the environment for their personal gain, prosecuting environmental crimes has become routine to serve as a deterrent. Pro would have to explain how education alone serves as a useful deterrent. </t>

    <t>Seeing as this is the final round, I will refute and then end with closing arguments.1) 'First off: 'according to my sources Arctic ice had increased from 2010, which is contrary to the expectations of global warming experts.'Sorry, was a typing error, I meant it increased from 2012. As I've shown before, the author of the article doesn't give any sort of conclusion. He gives 5 reasons why it's true, and 5 reasons why it's not. Not only that, but for his '50% more arctic ice' point, he doesn't give us any sources! This is ElmerB all over again!2) The global sea levels rose about 6.7 inches in the last century. The source is and if the rate of rising sea level remains same, it won't be having much effect. Also, it may promote development of underwater cities as they would have to do it for survival.But that's the problem, the sea levels are rising faster than they used to be! Instead of 6.7 inches in a year, the article I've linked indicates it will rise far more than 6.7 inches (1). Con also states, 'It may promote development of underwater cities as they would have to do it for survival.' I thought we were going to try and solve global warming, not run away from it.3) We must find a viable replacement of fossil fuels rather than targeting the removal of co2. If production of co2 continues at this level, what will be the use of reducing it through plants and stuff when we can directly attack the source? It is just like instead of plugging a leak in a ship, we take a bucket and keep throwing the water away. First we must tackle the leak, then we can clean up the ship.I have an analogy for you. Let's say your sink is leaky. You find where it is leaking, and you see a hole in a pipe. Instead of just ordering a replacement part, you need to find a way deal with the leak before the replacement part arrives! Analogies aside, who says we can't do both? I've already stated my plan (fertilizing the sea in order to create algal blooms). The U.S. Government is working on converting algae into a bio fuel with success (2). In other words, we can solve the global warming problem, and then harvest the algae once the pollutants are absorbed out of the atmosphere. 4) Yes, but the point I want to make is that fossil fuels are a finite resource and must be saved for later generations, or we will run out of it sooner or later. The predictions may or may not be accurate, but we all know that production of fossil fuel is not possible. We have to drill under the Earth to find their reserves. If there is a way to make sure energy production continues, we must take more concrete steps towards finding new sources of energy.We are (see above). But these steps are not economically or environmentally feasible yet, and the CO2 we produce is still an issue (3). Also, why do you think we should 'save some fossil fuels for later generations?' I thought you wanted to develop different alternatives to fossil fuels altogether.5) 'I've already shown how global warming is a reality, and you accept that'Just for this debate. Otherwise it will become a separate debate, and we will divert from the crux of the debate.Strange, because in every round thus far (including this one), you have linked 'evidence for why global warming isn't true.' I don't think you're telling the truth to the judges here. Examples:'Has co2 really increased that much, or is there another reason? And are the readings of 1900's even correct? Weather science is still flawed and developments are still occurring, how can we rely that readings of previous unadvanced centuries were correct and that this century is really colder than before? Diversion (Round 3, Con)-''Also, some of these links believe global warming may not be true (Round 1, Con)-''Some more links (or people) that are against global warming (Round 2, Con)-''according to my sources Arctic ice had increased from 2010, which is contrary to the expectations of global warming experts (Round 2, Con).'5) That being said, 7 billion humans breathe out carbon-dioxide everyday. Should we start killing people? No.6) But instead if we tackle the source, naturally even with the number of plants we have right now co2 will be gradually reduced and temperatures would recede to normal. 'Normal.' What temperature is normal? 7) Has co2 really increased that much, or is there another reason? And are the readings of 1900's even correct? Weather science is still flawed and developments are still occurring, how can we rely that readings of previous unadvanced centuries were correct and that this century is really colder than before? Diversion-Fallacious argument. 'There is no way to prove that the sources are correct, and therefore, global warming isn't true.' Fallacy of ignorance (they haven't dis/proven it, so it must be true/false).8) Fossil fuels have not been used properly until the industrial revolution, when machines required power that was generated from fossil fuels, and drills were made that could find new reservoirs of oil. 'Until Mad Max becomes a reality, no one will be killing each other over a gallon of gasoline or a watt of electricity.' Yet we know the unrest in the Middle East is because nations want to take control of the oil reservoirs. It is also because some Arabic countries believe Israel isn't entitled to the land they were given by the UN. It is also because of terrorist activity. It is also because of bad rulers, dictators. The article I've linked at the bottom talks about how it is not only oil that causes unrest in the Middle East (4).9) Worse still, fossil fuels can't be synthetically produced in lab, at least without wasting more resources than it is worth. Say if there was a way to utilize the energy of fossil fuel without burning it and causing pollution, how valuable and eco-friendly would fossil fuels become? And if a new energy source that would be renewable and cost efficient was invented, wouldn't people remark burning stuff for energy as archaic? We already have a solution to decrease co2, we must at the very least find a solution to meet the energy demands, should we not?See in my round 2 argument on algal blooms and how they a) solve the global warming problem, and b) can be converted into energy once carbon dioxide levels subside.Now, closing.Global warming is too big of a problem to ignore.We pollute this world. My opponent agrees. However, we disagree on how to solve it. Con would like you to believe that focusing on fossil fuels is all one has to do in order to combat global warming. This is far from the truth. We must first combat the emission, and then the source. We, the human race, are responsible for two million deaths a year due to our carelessness when it comes to air pollution (5). That's not even counting land and water pollution! We must combat the emissions, as they are simply to dangerous to let 'gradually reduce,' as is Con's plan. Instead, we must focus on absorbing these pollutants out of the atmosphere by encouraging growth of certain plants. See my Round 2 argument on algae being both a solution for global warming and a way to make clean energy for more information. I'm running out of word count.Thank you for this debate. Wonderful practice against a skilled opponent! Good luck in your future debates!</t>

    <t>1) Yes, the fuel shortage won't kill lives, but it would make survival difficult, as energy production would be severely affected. However, currently global warming isn't killing anyone as such, yes the Polar bears are losing some habitat, but according to my sources Arctic ice had increased from 2010, which is contrary to the expectations of global warming experts. For the temperature to be above the limit for our survival would take a lot more time than for fuel sources to be drained.First off: 'according to my sources Artic ice had increased from 2010, which is contrary to the expectiations of global warming experts.' What sources? Who wrote them? Are they up to date? Second, 'For the temperature to be above the limit for our survival would take a lot more time than for fuel sources to be drained.' Actually, it's not the temperature, it's the water! According to the National Wildlife Federation, 'New science published after the IPCC report has shown how global warming is happening faster than anticipated (1).' I recomend you read the article I'll link to this argument.2) We must work on devising alternative clean and efficient sources of energy rather than JUST planting trees.'You have agreed to this point.Not exacly. If you look through my Round 1 argument, I say I agree with you when it comes to 'JUST planting trees.' I then go on to state that trees are not the primary factor when it comes to cleaning up the enivironment. In other words, this statement you made is grossly overversimplfiying the problem that global warming is. Seeing as you may have been confused with my argument in round 1, I'll state it now: I dissagree with this point.3) Moreover, dealing with the fuel crisis will reduce global warming as well as vehicles cause pollutionYou say vehicles cause 34.9 percent of co2 emissions. What do factories and businesses use? Fuel, or in short electricity. Electricity production happens through clean sources like dams, solar panels and stuff, but also through nuclear reactors and generators. Generators take fuel. That adds up as well. Plus, does gasoline count as a fuel source? If it does, then its burning and production also cause pollution. Dealing with the fuel crisis will definitely impact global warming.And how is that electricity generated, Con? There's a scientific formula, in case you are unaware: Motion + Magnetism = Electricity. The most common way to get that motion is by using fossil fuels. Not hydropower, not solar panels, but fossil fuels. Annother limited resource. According to the EIA, renewables (Neuclear, hydropower, and other renewables) produce 1/3 of all electric power in the US (2). We are already formulating clean energy sources, as you would call them, and yet global warming is still occuring!4) Also, some of these links believe global warming may not be true.....Your final site redirects me to an article written by the one and only expert on the subject: Elmer B. I recommend you read this article in it's full extentI read the article, it gives ten reasons why climate change is a hoax.I'm glad you read your own article, but what I'm attacking is ElmerB's credibility as an expert on the subject of global warming. Using his article as proof is like finding annother debate on DDO and using their argument. He's a lay witness to the effects of global warming, and his 'findings' should not be treated as evidence.5) The facts on this site are mostly predictions about the future effects of global warming, and data from the previous century that could have been moulded due to outliers, such as location and the weather cycle.The facts on your site are also predictions about the future effects of a fuel shortage. Have you read your article? You even say it yourself, 'Here's a link that shows the predicted rate of fossil fuel depletion.' You even add that it is not accurate! Your link: In other words, your arguments have an equal amount of proofs against them. And since you are offering a counterplan, BoP is shared between Pro and Con. I've already shown how global warming is a reality, and you accept that. 'If it does, then its burning and production also cause pollution. Dealing with the fuel crisis will definitely impact global warming (Round 2, Con).' You agree to global warming being a problem caused by our pollution. My plan is to encourage growth of plant life to counteract the effects of CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide. Specificaly, to fertilize the ocean to encourage growth of algae in the ocean. Lead Researcher Prof. Rob Raiswell of Leeds University, part of a research team devoted to combating global warming through algae, states, 'The team will seek to create a massive algae bloom by releasing several tons of iron sulphate into the sea off the coast of the British island of South Georgia. The patch will apparently be large enough to be visible from space (3).' The article also states that 'If successful, the technique could be rolled out across vast swathes of the Great Southern Ocean. Scientists calculate that if the whole 20 million square miles was treated, it could remove up to three and a half Gigatons of C02, equivalent to one eighth of all global annual emissions from fossil fuels (3).' Out of all the possible ways to combat global warming, this seems to be the one that holds up. </t>

    <t>Seeing as you took the liberty to post an argument in round 1, I will as well. Beginning with definitions:Fuel crisis: a great bottleneck (or price rise) in the supply of energy resources to an economy.Global warming: a gradual increase in the overall temperature of the earth's atmosphere generally attributed to the greenhouse effect caused by increased levels of carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and other pollutants.Now, I'll refute your arguments.1) Currently, it would take more time for global warming to become extremely lethal than it would be for the fuel crisis.The fuel crisis will also take a long time to become extremely lethal. I don't see a lot of death when it comes to the fuel crisis. As defined above, this means if there is less supply, and the same demand, prices will rise. Until Mad Max becomes a reality, no one will be killing each other over a gallon of gasoline or a watt of electricity.2) We must work on devising alternative clean and efficient sources of energy rather than JUST planting trees. I agree. We shouldn't be focused on 'JUST planting trees.' Global warming is a way bigger problem than can be solved by planting a few saplings. According to Scientific American, '...A new study, however, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reports that forests' other climatic effects can cancel out their carbon cleaning advantage in some parts of the world. Using a three-dimensional climate model, the research team mimicked full global deforestation and also studied the effects of clear-cutting in different regions of latitude, such as the tropics and boreal zones. Apparently, these natural carbon sinks only do their job effectively in tropical regions; in other areas, they have either no impact or actually contribute to warming the planet. In fact, according to this model, by the year 2100, if all the forests were cut and left to rot, the annual global mean temperature would decrease by more than 0.5 degree Fahrenheit (1).' Trees are not the primary factor when it comes to decreasing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. I could get more into this, but I'll move onto your third point.3) Moreover, dealing with the fuel crisis will reduce global warming as well as vehicles cause pollution.Or will it? Studies done by the EIA (Energy Immision Administration) indicate that cars create approximately 29% of CO2 emissions (2). The rest? Factories, businesses, and other modes of transportation. Vehicles altogether count for only 34.9% of man-made CO2 emmisions (2). Attacking the fuel crisis alone would be to ignore 65.1% of other man-made scorces of CO2!4) Also, some of these links believe global warming may not be true. First off, links don't believe anything. The people who write them do. Secondly, your first link redirects me to an article that tells me, 'Here are the top 5 arguments for and against global warming.' In other words, the article does not affirm or deny global warming. Your second article redirects me to a couple, as the site calls them, 'COMMON MISSCONCEPTIONS ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING.'

It doesn't say which two years are being compared. And even if it is true, just see how much time global warming has before it affects us severely. Temperature increase in different localities are different as well. The facts on this site are mostly predictions about the future effects of global warming, and data from the previous century that could have been moulded due to outliers, such as location and the weather cycle. Some more links (or people) that are against global warming. Anyways, I would say that there is no concrete measurement of the intensity of global warming. Our weather prediction is bad enough as it is, what makes the people believe in global warming all of a sudden? Global warming has been overhyped due to media attention and the media should give more focus to the fuel shortage. Here's a link that shows the predicted rate of fossil fuel depletion. Yes, it may not be accurate, but the fact that fossil fuels take millions of years to form is accepted everywhere, and that once we are out of fuel, we may have no way of getting it back anytime sooner. Worse still, there are oil deposits in the Arctic, and if extraction takes place, it will have a negative effect on global warming. But if the fuel crisis is dealt with, there will be no need to melt the ice. Rather than looking at solving global warming before the fuel problem, we must solve the fuel shortage before global warming. Just look at the time spans. Fuel would run out roughly in a 100 years, global warming would only increase 2 celsius average in a 100 years, if the emissions double from the present.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank beforeifall for accepting this debate.CO2's Effect on TemperatureFirst, correlation. The climate data over the last 700,000 years or so show that temperature and CO2 track very close to each other. '...there is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2. The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv. The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr.'[1]This graph shows the CO2-temperature correlation over the last 650,000 years[2]: CO2 can be the dominant forcing for the climate. Consider the Cenozoic era (the last 65 million years). Overall, solar activity increased 0.4% over this period. 'Because Earth absorbs about 240 W/m^2 of solar energy, that brightness increase is a forcing of about 1 W/m^2. This small linear increase of forcing, by itself, would have caused a modest global warming through the Cenozoic Era.' The CO2 levels caused a much higher forcing. 'In contrast, atmospheric CO2 during the Cenozoic changed from at least 1000 ppm in the early Cenozoic to as small as 170 ppm during recent ice ages. The resulting climate forcing, as can be computed accurately for this CO2 range... exceeds 10 W/m^2. It is clear that CO2 was the dominant climate forcing in the Cenozoic.'[3]But then, there's also the matter of causation. CO2's effect on temperature can be explained by appealing to the carbon cycle. The Earth receives all of its energy from the sun. Some of this is reflected by the Earth's surface and by clouds and other particles present in the atmosphere. In addition, some of the built up energy in the Earth's surface can be emitted back into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases like CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide trap some of this emitted heat by reflecting the radiation back to the surface. However, greater concentrations of greenhouse gases cause more of the energy that is being emitted from the surface to be reflected back to the surface. This causes more heat to build up, warming the planet.[4]Now consider climate sensitivity. Climate sensitivity is the amount the temperature would rise if the CO2 concentration were doubled. Obviously, if there's a large climate sensitivity, then increases in CO2 have large effect. It is known that the climate sensitivity is around 1 degree C. However, this can be amplified through feedbacks. Positive ones amplify the sensitivity, while negative ones diminish the sensitivity. The evidence overwhelmingly comes down on the former, that positive feedbacks are happening. Increases in CO2 cause temperature increases, which are amplified by water vapor and the effect on clouds.'Since the radiative effects associated with the buildup of water vapor to near-saturation levels and the subsequent condensation into clouds are far stronger than the equilibrium level of radiative forcing by the non-condensing GHGs, this results in large local fluctuations in temperature about the global equilibrium value.'[5]This can be shown in the below graph[5]: Now back to the carbon cycle. Global warming can result in the death of vegetation (due to droughts) and the warming of the ocean. Both of these further reduce the maximum absorption of the Earths carbon cycle, thus resulting in even more CO2 being released into the atmosphere. And with this, CO2 increases even more. In other words, CO2-caused temperature increases are amplified by positive feedbacks and the mechanics of the carbon cycle.So, the positive feedback amplifies the climate sensitivity. How much it is amplified can be determined through study. Using a Bayesian statistical approach, which is “the dominant [method] in the literature”, these findings support the notion of climate sensitivity as maximum 4 degrees C, a mean of 3 degrees C, and likely not lower than 3 degrees.[6]The graph below gives a statistical analysis[7]:The mean is around 3 degrees C. The CO2 that humans emit thus has an effect of 3 degrees C per doubling of CO2. This can be shown by the fact that CO2 concentrations have increased from around 275 ppm to around 400 ppm. This is an increase of around 40%. This should manifest itself with a temperature increase of a little less than 1.5 degrees C. Indeed, temperatures have increased around this amount over the last 150 years. The anthropogenic-forcing climate models thus match observations.[8]In other words, in addition to the direct evidence of how the Earth is warming, the climate models based on a greenhouse gas cause to global warming explain almost perfectly the recent global warming. This is a lot of evidence for a human case to the recent global warming.Humans' Emission of CO2It would be rather coincidental if the recent rise in global warming happened to start just around the time that humans started to emit large quantities of greenhouse gases. However, there is direct evidence as well, in addition to the already established correlation between temperature and CO2.Now, it is known that CO2 levels are increasing. 'In pre-industrial times over the last 10,000 years, CO2 was relatively stable at around 275 to 285 parts per million. Over the last 250 years, atmospheric CO2 levels have increased by about 100 parts per million.' CO2 levels are increasing at a level not seen in at least 500,000 years, if not longer.[9]Here is a graph showing CO2 concentrations over the last 10000 years[10][11]:The evidence that this excess CO2 is the cause of the recent global warming is voluminous. One of the biggest indicators is the fact that less heat is escaping into space. Satellites measure less heat escaping out into space, particularly at the specific wavelengths that CO2 absorbs. In other words, the Earth is retaining a greater percentage of the heat that it receives from the sun than it did before. This excess heat manifests itself through global temperature increases. 'If less heat is escaping to space, where is it going? Back to the Earth's surface. Surface measurements confirm this, observing more downward infrared radiation. A closer look at the downward radiation finds more heat returning at CO2 wavelengths, leading to the conclusion that '...this experimental data should effectively end the argument by skeptics that no experimental evidence exists for the connection between greenhouse gas increases in the atmosphere and global warming.''[12][13][14]Another piece of evidence is a comparison of warming in the troposphere and stratosphere. Because the CO2 is in the upper troposphere, the troposphere temperature would increase, while the stratospheric temperature would decrease, because there would be less heat reaching the stratosphere. 'Computer model estimates of the ‘human influence’ fingerprint are broadly similar to the observed pattern. In sharp contrast, model simulations of internal and total natural variability cannot produce the same sustained, large-scale warming of the troposphere and cooling of the stratosphere.'[12][15][16]This graph shows this[15]:Related to this is the fact that the tropopause, the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere, is rising. This is because the temperature gradient between the top of the troposphere and the bottom of the stratosphere is greater, as just described above. This causes the warmer air from the troposphere to rise, pushing the troposphere up. 'Observations indicate that the height of the tropopause - the boundary between the stratosphere and troposphere - has increased by several hundred meters since 1979.'[12][17]Another related piece of evidence to this is the cooling of the ionosphere. The ionosphere is the layer of the Earth's atmosphere where ionization takes place. It comprises the upper mesosphere, thermosphere, and lower exosphere. More precisely, it extends from 60 km to 1000 km above the surface. Studies indicate, '...moderate negative trends of about 2 to 3 K per decade at heights of 50 to 70 km... slightly larger cooling trends at heights of 70 to 80 km in the low and middle latitudes... essentially zero temperature trends between 80 and 100 km... at heights near 350 km, a negative trend of about –17 K per decade.'[12][18]Yet another piece of evidence is the frequency of cold days and nights. Because the sun only shines in the day time, if the sun was causing global warming, the days would warm faster than the nights, while if greenhouse gases were causing global warming, this wouldn't be observed. It is the latter's prediction that is observed. 'What we observe is a decrease in cold nights greater than the decrease in cold days, and an increase in warm nights greater than the increase in warm days.'[12][15][19]This can be shown in the below graph[15]:Overall, the evidence shows that human-emitted greenhouse gases are the main cause of global warming. CO2, in addition to other greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide are being emitted by humans in very large amounts, and this is manifesting itself in an increase in the average global temperature.ConclusionGreenhouse gases cause global warming because of their heat trapping abilities. Humans have been emitting vast amounts of greenhouse gases over the last 150 years, and this shows itself on the CO2 measurements. The atmospheric warming pattern and greater heating at night are evidence that the recent global warming is caused by those human emitted greenhouse gases. These increases are amplified through the water vapor and cloud positive feedbacks and the positive feedback that arises through the climate cycle. The climate sensitivity ends up being around 3 degrees C. Finally, the CO2-temperature record shows that the two correlate with remarkable correlation.SourcesSources in comments.</t>

    <t>Numerous alternate causes to global warming prove that humans are not the primary source. Adopt a mindset of innocent until proven guilty, the affirmative must prove beyond correlation and doubt that human cause warming. The Pro must win that mankind is the 'principal [and] leading' meaning that if I win that there is an alternative cause that is more responsible for warming than humans, or at least humans are not a major cause, then I win the debate. (First Pro speech)As the Con, I may contradict myself as my sole purpose is to disprove the Pro's statement. The Pro must remain consistent to prove their position.First, 1,500 year climate cycles. Fred Singer, an atmospheric and space physicist with a PhD from Princeton who founded the the Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) and Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC), and Dennis Avery, a agricultural analyst who was awarded the National Intelligence Medal of Achievement, agree that there is substantial evidence around the world that climate cycles easily explain the warming we currently see. There is already a scientific consensus that cooling cycles (Ice Ages) exist, so it already not unreasonable to assume that warming cycles also exist. From 1300 to 1850, the Little Ice Age caused the earth to be about 2.5 degrees Celsius cooler than average. The Modern Warming portion of the cycle began in 1850, and 'warming will continue for some time in the future, perhaps 200 years or more, regardless of human activity.' Thus, today's warming can be explained by these climate cycles. These scientists gathered data from North America to Asia, and they use the ice caps in Greenland to further prove that by the way the ice formed, there must have been 1,500 year warming cycles. Sea sediment core in Ireland also shows the 1,500 year cycle. Fossilized pollen, boreholes, tree rings, and mountain tree lines all provide evidence to this theory because scientists can find how they were created or observe differing distances of tree rings to find the amount of warming that these objects underwent while being created. It's important to realize that completely dismissing 1,500 year cycles dismisses 'human histories from the past 2,000 years...and a variety of physical evidence found by a huge body of serious researchers.' (1) The Vostok ice sample that the rise and fall of CO2 correlate with natural cycles. Temperatures correlate with Ice Age minimus and maximus. There is a 420,000 thousand year cycle of carbon emissions. Given that humans release very little of the total carbon ouput, the correlation is between the carbon cycle and temperature cycle. (5)Secondly, human emissions of carbon dioxide are specifically not to blame. Patrick Moore, a former member of Greenpeace and an ecologist said the following while testifying in front of Congress: 'There is no scientific proof that human emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) are the dominant cause of the minor warming of the Earth's atmosphere over the past 100 years.' In fact, carbon dioxide levels were 10x higher during the Ice Ages than they are now. This was also true 500 million years ago before evolution had created humans. Not only does this empiric disprove that humans are a major cause of increased carbon dioxide, but it also disproves that CO2 causing warming. Regardless of the theoretical examples the Pro provides, empirics trump. Third, the industrial revolution began in 1750, yet only from 1910 to 1940, there was an increase in .5 degrees Celsius of the global temperature. There was more than enough time for factories to produce enough carbon dioxide to have resulted in warming before those 200 years. This delay in increase prove that humans are not the main cause and is evidence of the climate cycles. (2) During this time, temperatures were much higher than today, but CO2 levels were lower. This places doubt in the significance of anthropogenic CO2 release. (7)Fourth, the climate rapidly changes to different stimuli. Anthony Lupo, assistant professor of atmospheric science at the University of Missouri at Columbia and an expert reviewer for the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Chang, discusses the fact that regional climates tend to experience much more change than globally. However, climates change rapidly, so if human emissions of CO2 really are responsible for warming, then 1) there should already be a much larger change in global temperature given the huge increase of CO2 emissions and 2) even when there were smaller amounts of CO2, this should have been enough to trigger an environmental change (3).Fifth, climate models fail. There was an increase in global temperature of 0.57C during the 30-year period from 1970 to 2000. Since then there has been no increase, perhaps a slight decrease, in average global temperature. This clearly disproves the numerous computer models that the Pro cites as CO2 had increased after 2000 (2). Many believe that there will be an increase of anywhere from 2-11 degrees Fahrenheit due to info from computer models. Misinterpretation of results and models lacking the complexities of the fundamental global processes mean that these cannot be trusted. Consistently, politicians like Al Gore have predicted that the world would have literally ended by now. Prefer direct facts and empirical examples rather than theoretical results of greenhouse gases. Thus, do not automatically trust that greenhouse gases cause warming without direct evidence from changes in temperature â€' the facts don't support this conclusion. (3) Though the Earth is warming, it's cooler than expected. There should have already been a two degree Celsius increase 100,000 years ago. (5) [Insert pie graph from this source]Sixth, fossil fuels do not cause an increase in CO2 levels according to the most accurate NASA data. From 1940 to 1950, CO2 levels flatlined. The only change was roughly .8 ppm downwards. World War II caused a massive increase in fossil fuel levels, yet this did not change CO2 levels. Prefer empirics. (4) Also, the Vostok ice core sample proves. CO2 increases did not increase temperature for 800 years. This sample also explains why a fall in temperature and a fall in CO2 correlate — cold water can hold more CO2 than warm water. Even more, temperature falls around 800-1,000 years before CO2 levels rise or fall giving water time to absorb the CO2. (5)Seventh, even if humans do increase CO2 levels, they're only responsible for a 3% increase. Even that released CO2 is not all directly released into the atmosphere given that the oceans absorb so much of it. Limestone, chalk, and other rocks have 100x as much CO2 as the atmosphere. This 3% is responsible for .27% of the greenhouse effect. 'If we were to cease all transport and industry right now, it is very unrealistic to assume that it would have any impact on global warming.' (5) Eighth, solar radiation is the single largest cause of warming. NASA repeatedly releases articles explaining the importance of the sun and sun cycles on the Earth. The near infrared and visible light waves are absorbed by the lower atmosphere, the oceans, and the land. Thus, these areas heat resulting in a higher global average temperature. Even more, absorption of UV rays heats the stratosphere. There's a general scientific consensus that this increases temperatures in the troposphere. Additionally, sun spots serve to reduce or increase warming. These can sway warming either way considering that these are 11 year cycles. This can explain why times of higher CO2 did not increase temperature. Scientists believe that the sun is responsible for at least half of all the climate change seen in the past 110 years. Even the IPCC, an organization devoted to creating response to globa warming, agrees. (6)The 100,000 year cycle of radiation resulting from the elliptical orbit of the Earth is at a peak and will be for the next several thousand years. This radiation is consistent with spikes in CO2 methane. The melting of ice caps has happened with each of these cycles. The huge volume of these gases is too high to be anthropogenic but is consistent with previous cycles. Mars is also increasing in temperature due to the recent increase in solar radiation. Dr. H. Abdussamatov, head of the  St. Petersburg Pulkova Astronomical Observatory, believes that the Earth has hit a temperature ceiling and will enter a cooling period despite fossil fuel use. This explanation accounts for the lack of increased greenhouse gas emissions since 1988. (7) [Insert Figure III]ConclusionSolar radiation, solar cycles, and multiple terrestrial temperature cycles are greater and more probable causes of warming. Humans produce very little emissions given the oceans' absorption and solar radiation cycles. The Earth has consistently changed temperatures before humans populated the planet. Even more, multiple empirics and evidence from around the world disprove the importance of humans on warming. 3% is a ridiculously small number when compared to multiple other emittors. CO2 levels were higher in the Ice Age when the Earth was substantially cooler. By placing some amount of doubt in the significance of mankind's importance on warming while promoting several other causes, humans are at least not the main factor of warming.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank beforeifall for presenting his argument. 1500-Year CyclesThe 1500-year cycles are not global. Most of the data that scientists have found on this has come from the northern hemisphere. However, in the southern hemisphere, the exact opposite trend happens. In other words, whenever the northern hemisphere is warming, the southern hemisphere is cooling, and vice versa. 'Whereas Antarctic and Greenland climate records do exhibit approximate anti-phase behavior around 50% of the time, they are generally in phase during cooling. A phase lead of Southern Hemisphere climate of 1000-1600 years is statistically indistinguishable from a lag of 400-800 years, whether for Dansgaard-Oeschger [1500-year cycles], Heinrich, or longer-duration events. The 'seesaw' or 'Southern lead' appearance of the data arises from the fundamentally different characeristics of the climate series, most importantly the absence of rapid warming events in Antarctica comparable to those in Greenland'.[1]However, in the current case, we see that both the northern and southern hemispheres are warming, meaning that it cannot be due to the 1500-year cycles.[2]Human Emissions of Carbon DioxideThe claim that CO2 levels were higher during certain ice ages is based off of old, faulty data. A recent study found that the levels during the Ordovician era (the era most climate skeptics focus on when making arguments like this) were eight times below pre-Industrial levels. This is indeed still a little high, but it's also important bearing in mind that the sun was dimmer then. During the Ordovician era, the sun was 4% dimmer. This meant that higher CO2 levels would have been necessary for Earth to have not been frozen over. This is based on established nuclear models of main sequence stars. Considering all of this, '...over the long term, there is indeed a correlation between CO2 and paleotemperature'.[3][4][5]Apparent Mismatch Between CO2 and Temperature IncreasesIt is true that the vast majority of the warming happened over the 20th century. However, it is also true that the vast majority of the CO2 emitted into the atmosphere was emitted over the 20th century. See the graph below[6]:It is easy to see that only a small fraction of the emitted CO2 was emitted before 1900, and this correlates with the fact that only a small fraction of the temperature increases occurred before 1900.Amount of CO2 EmissionsAny CO2 emitted into the atmosphere would have an adverse effect on the climate. As I said in the last round, there was a study that said, using a Bayesian statistical approach, the climate sensitivity as maximum 4 degrees C, a mean of 3 degrees C, and likely value of not lower than 3 degrees. This means that the CO2 that humans emit thus has an effect of 3 degrees C per doubling of CO2. This can be shown by the fact that CO2 concentrations have increased from around 275 ppm to around 400 ppm. This is an increase of around 40%. This should manifest itself with a temperature increase of a little less than 1.5 degrees C. This is indeed around the amount of global warming we have seen so far. It should not be more than this.[7][8]If less CO2 had been added into the atmosphere, then the planet would have warmed less, but it still would have warmed. This would be true for any non-zero amount of CO2 emission. Climate ModelsThis point is irrelevant. The climate is much more complicated than just a correlation between CO2 and temperature (even though it still exists). Climate models have to be extraordinarily complicated, and even so, they might leave out very important climate forcings. Even if they didn't, there might still be glitches in the models that would make the model give an invalid result. The ability for climate models to accurately predict the climate is completely independent of the whether or not CO2 levels are related to temperature levelsIt is worth falsifying the notion, however, that there has been no warming since 2000. This idea is based on satellite measurements of atmospheric temperature. However, there are two problems with this. One, while the atmosphere accounts for only less than 3% of increased heat content, the oceans account for the vast majority, and they show no such trend.[9] The graph below shows this[10]: And two, there have been a lot of negative short term forcings over the last 20 years. Removing the short term trends of the extremely powerful El Nino in 1998, volcanic activity, and solar activity, the atmospheric temperature plot looks more smooth[11]:(You can faintly see what the plot looked like before the negative forcings were removed; the variability after 1998 makes any analysis before a statistical reanalysis suspect).Correlation Between CO2 Emissions and CO2 LevelsMany studies have shown that the 'airborne fraction', or the fraction of human CO2 emissions that stay in the atmopshere, is around 43%. The fact that the CO2 levels flatlined during WWII is actually rather complicated. While military activity spiked, other industrial activity plummeted and millions of people died, decreasing the need for non-military CO2 emission even lower. In addition, CO2 levels are not known with the precision necessary to unravel this mystery before 1960, due to improper measuring techniques. There are simply too many factors too consider to make a sound conclusion here.As for the apparent 800-year lag in CO2 levels after temperature increases, this is indeed true. However, this is because there was no non-natural (i.e. human) forcing of CO2. Instead, another forcing initiates the warming trend, and CO2 amplifies it. 'When the Earth comes out of an ice age, the warming is not initiated by CO2 but by changes in the Earth's orbit. The warming causes the oceans to release CO2. The CO2 amplifies the warming and mixes through the atmosphere, spreading warming throughout the planet. So CO2 causes warming and rising temperature causes CO2 rise. Overall, about 90% of the global warming occurs after the CO2 increase.'[12]Human Versus Natural CO2 EmissionNatural CO2 emissions are typically stable, meaning that there is rarely any long term climate change that results from natural emissions of CO2. However, humans have emitted a lot of CO2, above and beyond what is naturally emitted, and this unbalances the climate stability. 'Although our output of 29 gigatons of CO2 is tiny compared to the 750 gigatons moving through the carbon cycle each year, it adds up because the land and ocean cannot absorb all of the extra CO2. About 40% of this additional CO2 is absorbed. The rest remains in the atmosphere.'[13]Solar ActivityThe most important of the natural climate forcings is indeed the sun. It is the source of the Earth's energy. This energy comes from the radiation emitted as a result of fusion reactions at the core of the sun. This radiation is known as the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI). Any change in the TSI causes energy imbalances on the Earth. This energy imbalance can be calculated using the formula below[14]:Delta means change, so Delta(F) means the change in energy (i.e. energy imbalance) and Delta(TSI) means the change in solar irradiance. The 0.7 factor comes from the fact that the Earth reflects about 30% of the solar radiation it receives, and the 1/4 factor comes from spherical geometry.Changes in temperature are proportional to the energy imbalance. This can be expressed in the formula below[14]:Lambda is the constant of proportionality, representing the climate sensitivity (discussed in my first argument) in this case.The only thing that's left is to actually determine the values. First, the change in TSI (in this case, between 1900 and 1950). '...we'll estimate the change in TSI at 0.5 to 2 W-m-2.' This corresponds to an energy imbalance of around 0.1-0.35 W-m-2. Next, the lambda factor. I explained in the last article that the statistically most probable value for the climate sensitivity was around 3 degrees C. But, there was a lot of variation. 'Studies have given a possible range of values of 2 to 4.5°C warming for a doubling of CO2, which corresponds to a range of 0.54 to 1.2°C/(W-m-2) for λ.' This gives range of values from 0.05 to 0.4 degrees C, with a most probable value of 0.15 degrees C (corresponding to the statistically most likely climate sensitivity). In other words, solar activity from 1900 to 1950 raised the temperature of the Earth 0.15 degrees C. Looking at the effect of CO2 emissions over that same period, humans increased the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere by about 20 parts per million, giving a range of values of 0.14-0.32 degrees C for the effect of that emission on the climate, with the most probable being 0.22 degrees C.[14][15]This corresponds to CO2 amounting for 60% of the warming from 1900-1950. After that, it gets higher. CO2 emissions rise exponentally, and changes in the TSI start getting less positive, and eventually become negative after 1975. 'Over the past century, this increase in TSI is responsible for about 15-20% of global warming. But since TSI hasn't increased in at least the past 32 years (and more like 60 years, based on reconstructions), the Sun is not directly responsible for the warming over that period.' Solar activity cannot account for the warming after 1975, and even before that was a smaller factor than CO2.[14][15]This can be shown in the image below[16]:Therefore, we see CO2 correlates with recent temperature increases better than solar activity, especially after 1975.Long Term Forcings and MarsThe cycle of radiation is so long that it would not be having the sudden, enormous effect we've seen over the last 150 years. As for Mars, the studies concluded that it was a change in the surface dust, not solar activity, that caused the warming. Surface dust has a massive effect on Mars's climate. The supposed warming trend went from before the surface dust change to after it. Therefore, Mars did not warm because of solar activity.[17][18]SourcesSources in comments.</t>

    <t>Thank you for the chance to debate this topic. I am an avid believer that climate change is mainly man made, at least now.  Your first point was how even though data shows a correlation between CO2 emissions and temperature, carbon emission is not the largest factor. But according to the World Meteorological Organization (as well as NASA and countless organizations and scientists), CO2 is the largest factor of global warming. This study included natural substances like water vapor. The problem with CO2 is that it is a very abundant greenhouse gas which takes a long time to dissipate from the atmosphere. 65% of global emissions are CO2 emissions, making it by far the most abundant man made greenhouse gas. Even though it isn't as abundant as water vapor, it is much more effective at trapping the Sun's rays. Now, greenhouse gases are the largest cause of global warming, while the most effective and very abundant greenhouse gas is CO2. Here are some graphs:  From NASA, this is probably the most infamous graph as it shows just how drastic CO2 emissions have gone up. Enlightening, isn't it?  Now this concerns temperature rise at the same time as CO2 rise. This link should have the graph close to the top on the right hand side Not only that, but a massive 97% of all scientists agree global warming is man made. Your second point was that temperatures were higher in the past than they are now (specifically, during the time of Roman civilization). While there definitely are natural cycles that rise and lower, Earth's temperature is accelerating at a much faster rate than any natural cycle before, and shows no sign of stopping like a cycle would. This is again, because of man made emissions, and the majority of those are carbon. Your third point was that global warming is mainly due to sun rays hitting the earth and heating it up. While sun rays hit the earth and that is what causes all weather, the amount of rays stays basically stable like the earths orbit. So when greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere, they trap sun rays and warm the earth.  So the evidence shows clearly that global warming is mainly people driven, although natural cycles may contribute to the increase. The evidence shows clearly that greenhouse gases are the largest cause of global warming. The evidence shows clearly that CO2 is the largest greenhouse gas threat. Therefore, the evidence shows that CO2 is the main cause of global warming. </t>

    <t>The Macquarie Dictionary defines the term 'climate change' as- a significant change in the usual climatic conditions especially that thought to be caused by global warming. This 'climate change' can be caused by natural or human induced impacts.  The global average temperature has risen by nearly a degree in the past 50 years. Scientists around the world have been recording temperature increases, raised ocean levels and melting of ice caps. All this is evidence that the earth is experiencing a 'climate change'.  Many people believe that this change is primarily due to the fact that our CO2 emissions have created more greenhouse gases. They believe that there is a relationship between the rise in temperatures and the rise in CO2 emissions.  Data shows an 'association' between temperature levels and CO2 emissions but does not necessarily prove that increased CO2 levels are the most significant aspect of today's climate change.  For something complex like the weather system, many scientists are needed to unravel the story behind climate change. While most scientists believe climate change occurs, not all agree on the extent and relevance of human activity as an influence on climate change.  While major international climate agencies all emphasise the critical role of CO2 emissions in climate change, others are not so sure.  For example, some scientists have conducted research that suggests that temperatures were higher than they are today, during the Roman and Medieval periods. These ancient civilisations would not have emitted CO2 emissions as we do today, so why did their temperatures rise?  Temperatures have risen and fallen for a long time. The National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) states that climate change over the longer term is mainly due to the amount of sun energy hitting the Earth. Slight changes in the Earth's orbit and changes in sun ray intensity, can alter the temperatures here on Earth.  Even so, most scientists still emphasise the role of CO2 emissions in unprecedented, rapid global warming. The frank fact is that climate change cannot be stopped. It is completely natural.</t>

    <t>Before I begin I would like to initially reinforce the topic of the debate: CO2 emissions are DIRECTLY responsible for climate change. As the negative, I will rebut the affirmative as to why CO2 emissions (whilst adding to the heat of the planet) are not directly responsible for the changes we are experiencing on our Earth today.  The affirmative stated statistics such as- 'CO2 is the largest factor of global warming', '97% of scientists agree global warming is man-made', 'CO2 is the largest greenhouse gas threat'. Whilst these points may be tried and tested, they do not favour the topic when the phrase 'directly responsible' is included.  From what I gather, the affirmative believes that CO2 is speeding up the process of global warming. Whilst this may be true, in between the lines of this statement we can discover that another factor is actually CAUSING the process of global warming. As the negative, I believe that the cause is the fluctuation of the Earth's orbit (which the affirmative incorrectly stated as 'stable') and the consistent rise and fall of the planet's historical temperatures.  I stand by the points I raised in the first round and have now refuted the rebuttal put forward by the affirmative and regarded it as invalid. Does the affirmative have anything within it's case to state why my reason for global warming is incorrect? Do they believe that CO2 emissions are the initial cause of the Earth heating world-wide? By now, they should surely agree that CO2 emission are not directly responsible for climate change.</t>

    <t>To conclude my case I would like to point out the obvious flaws in the opposition's previous case. They stated:  'Before I make my points, I would like to address the mistaken Negative. I do know that the topic is 'CO2 is the largest factor in global warming', and that is what I am arguing. I'm sorry if that wasn't made clear in my evidence, but if you look back you will find that I certainly did argue that point. Your evidence was arguing against CO2 being the largest factor, and as your opponent that is what I must counter. Now that it's out of the way, let's begin.'  Once again I correct the affirmative on the correct wording of the topic. The topic of this debate is that CO2 emissions are directly responsible for climate change. Throughout their entire case the affirmative seems to be referring to their fictional topic of: CO2 is the largest factor in global warming.  The affirmative also stated that my evidence was backing this fictional topic. Whilst this may be true, proving that CO2 emissions are not the largest factor of global warming only adds to the overall proof that they are not directly responsible for the effects.  To clear confusion, the definition of directly responsible is: without anyone or anything intervening. Whilst the affirmative continued to provide arguments proving the existence of CO2 emissions as the largest factor, they did not provide any points stating the absence of an intervention.  There are many examples of other processes in our natural world that are speeding up the global warming. Some of these include methane emissions from cattle, deforestation and chemical fertilisers on crop lands. Although the affirmative believes that CO2 emissions play the largest role in heating the planet, they are not the sole reason behind the issue.  If the impossible event of a CO2 emission cease occurred, the Earth would still be heating up. Slowly but surely, the effects of the Earth's orbit and the causes mentioned above will continue to heat the planet that we live on today.  The affirmative also stated: 'the effects of the Suns rays on earth are increasing.'  In theory, this phrase mentions the effects on sun rays on Earth. Incredulously, even these sun rays play a role in global warming and further diminish the affirmatives picture of CO2 emissions being directly responsible.  In a surprising twist to the debate, the affirmative suddenly seems to understand the topic of the debate towards the end of their case and produces the statement below. Unfortunately, it is also flawed.  'CO2 was the initial cause of global warming, and this is shown in hundreds of studies and tests since that show the before and after the industrial revolution. The fact is, today CO2 is the largest factor and the cause, and I have all the sources to support it.'  Cold hard evidence against the point brought up by the affirmative can be found in my first argument. Global warming is simply defined as increasing temperatures on our planet. Carbon dating and a myriad of other scientific tests show the heating and cooling of the planet well before the involvement of the Industrial Revolution. If the planet was heating up during Medieval periods, how can the affirmative say that CO2 is the cause of global warming when the people of the past had not even heard of the word carbon?  In finality, I am not denying the fact that global warming exists. I am not denying that CO2 emissions play a considerable role in the heating of our planet. However, I do deny the views of the affirmative in thinking the CO2 emissions play a sole role in global warming. There are many other factors that are also contributing to the heating of our planet.  In further expansion, I deny the politicians and organisational leaders within our world. The planet is heating up and it is effecting ecosystems and environments alike. Whilst we sit here and debate whether CO2 emissions are directly responsible, politicians all over the globe are doing the same. It is time to stop the debate and face the fact that although CO2 emissions have played a big role in global warming, the gradual heating of our planet is totally inevitable.  As an international force we need to combat global warming and thus climate change by investigating new methods of adapting to a changing climate. Cooling down the Earth by reducing CO2 emissions is a false statement because the Earth will continue to heat via its natural cycles which we as humans would be wrong to alter.  As the negative side, I strongly believe that CO2 emissions are not directly responsible for climate change. Thank you.</t>

    <t>Before I make my points, I would like to address the mistaken Negative. I do know that the topic is 'CO2 is the largest factor in global warming', and that is what I am arguing. I'm sorry if that wasn't made clear in my evidence, but if you look back you will find that I certainly did argue that point. Your evidence was arguing against CO2 being the largest factor, and as your opponent that is what I must counter. Now that it's out of the way, let's begin.  Negative thinks I only believe CO2 is speeding up the process of climate change. It most definitely is, and they are not mistaken in that. But not only is it speeding up and forcing climate change to continue, it is the main factor in this.  No matter what my opponent may think, my evidence clearly showed CO2 is the largest threat. Greenhouse gases are proven to be the largest contributor to global warming, and CO2 is the largest greenhouse gas. And according to the World Meteorological Organization, the US Environmental Protection Agency, NASA, the European Commission and thousands of scientists, CO2 is the largest factor.  Negative may say that fluctuations in the earths orbit are the largest cause. To say that fluctuations in earths orbit are the largest cause is a bold statement. I think that by orbit fluctuations, he means that it causes Suns rays to hit the earth more. But according to NASA, solar maxima is only .1 percent higher than solar minima on average.  To further my counter argument, if there had been an increase in solar output, both the stratosphere and troposphere would have warmed up. But instead, patterns show that the stratosphere has actually cooled. Meanwhile, land and the troposphere have been warming, which is no doubt due to greenhouse gases (particularly CO2). This shows that fluctuations in earths orbit, although drastically climate changing when they occur, are not occurring right now.  However, the effects of the Suns rays on earth are increasing. Not because of orbit fluctuation, but because of greenhouse gases that trap the Suns heat.  CO2 is directly responsible for global warming today. In the earlier graph, I showed how carbon emissions have increased drastically since the industrial revolution. I then linked a graph that showed temperature increase over the same time period. The fact is, since the industrial revolution, temperatures have drastically increased at a rate that would never have occurred without coal burning and that whole era. So CO2 emission IS directly responsible for global warming.  The negative, in their conclusion, called my points invalid. I say the exact opposite. I stand by my points, and the facts that went with it. I most surely do not agree that their case is correct. I have just shown why their case is completely wrong. CO2 was the initial cause of global warming, and this is shown in hundreds of studies and tests since that show the before and after the industrial revolution. The fact is, today CO2 is the largest factor and the cause, and I have all the sources to support it. And sources I cited earlier.</t>

    <t>Sorry for the overuse of qoutes brevity and late timing. I have an unexpected on demand essay to finish by midnight.1. One of your main arguments against zoo/aquariums is that most are for-profit and basically roadside attractions. I obviously recognize that many of these side zoos/aquariums practice animal cruelty, which is definetley illegal. However, you can't deny an institution that has the ability to conserve, educate and protect animals because others exploit the system. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of zoos/aquariums have properly accredited under organizations such as the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums, the Zoological Association of America,etc, and who serve millions of people, not just towns, childrens birthday parties. Work should be done to encourage improvement, not discourage zoos because their are exploitations.2. It is impossible to measure the certain magnitude of which people learn when visiting a zoo. This is because some of the public may visit for purely entertaimment, many students and adults paticipate in wide varities of learning acitvities. Saint Louis is a prime example:'At the Saint Louis Zoo, about 400,000 children and adults participate in our formal programs, including classes and Camp KangaZoo each year. And of our 3,000,000 visitors annually, about 1,900,000 interact with an educational interpreter, docent or zookeeper who provides educational experiences and information. Each year the Zoo is visited by over 1,400 school groups who come for a free field trip. Of these schoolchildren, 31% are from economically disadvantaged neighborhoods, and 17% are special needs children.'[1] Zoos have a uniqe ability to educate the public, with over 600 million visitors a year.  'The chance to see real animals close up can evoke an emotional response, allowing people to attach values to animals, making them aware of the biodiversity crisis, as well as teaching and motivating people (Ballantyne and Packer, 2005; Gwyne, 2007; Fa, Funk and O’Connell, 2011; Rabb and Saunders, 2005). Within this mission, zoos provide an experience which is also recreational but which can inspire cognitive learning, long-term positive attitudes and behaviour change (Broad and Weiler, 1998). provides an opportunity for families to learn in a more relaxed environment, often limited elsewhere (Briseno, Anderson and Anderson, 2007)'. Some authors believe that education is more challenging when distracted by entertainment. However studies have shown that many students tend to learn in positive and active enviroments such as zoos.3 Zoos are actually vital to conservation of animals.'A species protected in captivity provides a reservoir population against a population crash or extinction in the wild. Here they are relatively safe and can be bred up to provide foundation populations. A good number of species only exist in captivity and still more only exist in the wild because they have been reintroduced from zoos, or the wild populations have been boosted by captive bred animals. Quite simply without these efforts there would be fewer species alive today and ecosystems and the world as a whole would be poorer for it. Although reintroduction successes are few and far between, the numbers are increasing and the very fact that species have been saved or reintroduced as a result of captive breeding shows their value. Even apparently non-threatened species and entire groups can be threatened suddenly (as seen with white nose syndrome in bats and the Chytridiomycosisfungus in amphibians) it’s not just pandas and rhinos that are under threat.'</t>

    <t>Zoos are are valuable for public education, awareness, and scientific research. Zoos allow humans to connect and learn about animals through a personal level.F or an example to outline the good of zoos, I will be using the Saint Louis Zoo as well as other institutions.1. Many children, as well as adults, visit zoos through field trips formal classes, workshops, tours, outreach programs, camps, lectures etc. To understand this impact lets look at the The Saint Louis zoo:'At the Saint Louis Zoo, about 400,000 children and adults participate in our formal programs, including classes and Camp KangaZoo each year. And of our 3,000,000 visitors annually, about 1,900,000 interact with an educational interpreter, docent or zookeeper who provides educational experiences and information. Each year the Zoo is visited by over 1,400 school groups who come for a free field trip. Of these schoolchildren, 31% are from economically disadvantaged neighborhoods, and 17% are special needs children.'[1]Zoos can also provide an education far beyond the confines of a classroom, since it allows children (and adults) to be physically awed and inspired by many magnificent creatures. Not only is the learning in the outside world and active, but it gives students greater appreciation of the natural world.[2]2. The rates of animal extinction and endangernment through human acticity grows increasingly alarming everyday. This is a mostly undisputed fact. According to the Center for Bilogical Diversity:'Although extinction is a natural phenomenon, it occurs at a natural “background” rate of about one to five species per year. Scientists estimate we’re now losing species at 1,000 to 10,000 times the background rate, with literally dozens going extinct every day,with as many as 30 to 50 percent of all species possibly heading toward extinction by mid-century n fact, 99 percent of currently threatened species are at risk from human activities, primarily those driving habitat loss, introduction of exotic species, and global warming.'Zoos can slow the rate of extinction because it allows researchers to analyze the behaviors of animals in their enviroments without expensive expeditions into the wild. This information is valuable to park rangers, nature documentaries, field researchers etc. because of increased understanding on  behavior, reproductive biology, nutrition, animal health and genetics.[4]3. Zoos around the world are leaders in encouraging the safety and protection of animals and wildlife. Man zoos set up insituitons and fundations that work throughout the world to save wild life, beyond just the valuable research they provide. For example, the Saint Louis Zoo 'has set up the WildCare Institute to work in conservation hotspots locally and around the globe.' 4. Of course incidents occur in any facility and intitution, but zoos have taken strides to increase human and wildlife safety.'Particularly, those facilities and the individuals employed by them that aspire to the ideals, ethics and ever-increasing standards of animal care and behavioral training represented by organizations such as the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums, the Zoological Association of America, the International Marine Animal Trainers’ Association, and the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, to name a few.' Also, I would appreciate if you evidence/citations to support your claims.</t>

    <t>I admit the zoos aren't the ideal situation for animals. Some may be kept in cruel and unfortunate cages and concrete slabs. One of your main arguments are that since some animals are mistreated and suffer from mental illness, animals should not be kept in zoos. This disregards not only the potential of zoos to raise awareness, engage the public, increase research, and conserve species, but the strides that many credited, and the most popular and visited, zoos have made. These facilities have teams of experts who analyze the mental state of the animals, massive facilities that are perfectly adequate for animals to roam, and can use these efforts to conserve species world wide. These zoos conform to the AZA standards that enforce strict animal safety. It is true that only 12% of zoos contribute/registered directly to conservation, but many zoos cannot afford to pay for such programs. Instead, the zoos engage the public in learning and interacting with animals on a physical, if not personal, level, which in turn raises appreciation of animals and the therefore an increased effort towards conservation. In the zoos that can afford to be involved in conservation programs, progress has been notable:'Most zoos are not only great places to get up close to wildlife, but many are also doing their part to bolster dwindling populations of animals still living free in the wild. To wit, dozens of zoos across North America participate in the Association of Zoos and Aquarium’s (AZA’s) Species Survival Plan (SSP) Program, which aims to manage the breeding of specific endangered species in order to help maintain healthy and self-sustaining populations that are both genetically diverse and demographically stable. The end goal of many SSPs is the reintroduction of captive-raised endangered species into their native wild habitats. According to the AZA, SSPs and related programs have helped bring black-footed ferrets, California condors, red wolves and several other endangered species back from the brink of extinction over the last three decades. Zoos also use SSPs as research tools to better understand wildlife biology and population dynamics, and to raise awareness and funds to support field projects and habitat protection for specific species. AZA now administers some 113 different SSPs covering 181 individual species.'[1]There is no doubt that zoos can and do provide valuable researchs and insights into animals, inspire the public to learn about and care for animals, and ensure the survival of species. And the number of zoos that do this grow incresingly everyday. Why do we discourage zoos when the have this potential and the safety and understanding of animals increase everyday? To put this in perspective, I'll detail I quick scenario that happens in the world today. China is the world's leading producer of rare earth metals, with an estimate  of 90% of world production, and enforce a strict monopoly. Now, American mining companies have started up with rare earth metals. Some of the mines were shut down for safety/enviromental reasons. However, some mines maintain safe circumstances and are actually more efficient than some Chinese facilities through progress and are slowly but surely lessening the monpoloy. The question is, do we abandon the mines because many mines fail without the proper circumstances, or invest in what can and is beneficial to further increase its abilities to progress and avoid the shut down of an industry?[2] </t>

    <t>In a British study, 59% of children at the zoo had no positive educational outcomes at a zoo. That number rose to 66% without a guide. In another study, 62% of children had no positive outcome or a negative outcome. One of the researchers for the British study said: 'In many cases, a trip to the zoo had a negative impact on the children's understanding of animals and habitats.' Showing children animals in zoos simply teaches them that animals are ours to control. It sets a very bad example. Think of the last time you went to the zoo. Don't lie. You probably didn't learn very much. Sure, you may have read some of the plaques, but more likely you just considered the animals as entertainment. You may have laughed as the otters or seals swam in endless circles in there small pools, or gotten excited when the lion finally paced past the glass where you are standing. But you also may have rolled your eyes and walked right by the bear exhibit when you saw that the polar bears were sleeping (booooring, right?) But you may not have realized that they were sleeping because their body is not meant for the hot climate where you may live.  People can get a lot more educated by simply watching a nature documentary. In this they will see the animals acting normally, and they will see them in their natural habitat. When you see an animal in a zoo you are not seeing them as they would be in the wild. You are seeing a miserable institutionalized animal that is being exploited for entertainment.  As I said before, only 12% of zoos are registered for captive breeding or wildlife conservation. One activist pointed out that 'Wild animal parks and zoos almost always favor large and charismatic animals.' The fact remains that most animals in zoos are not endangered.  Some examples include: Kangaroos, llamas, ostriches, capybaras, emus, black bears, moose, deer, beluga whales, lions, and giraffes. And if we are specifically talking about Seaworld, well, there is no data on whether or not orcas are endangered. So they cannot use that as an excuse.  Human activities that cause pollution, climate change, and the destruction of habitats are not helped by the captive breeding programs, although these problems threaten more than 7000 species. There is no point breeding animals in captivity when one, they cannot be released into the wild because of behavioral issues since they were born in captivity, and two, they have no habitats to go back to. We need to end animal prisons and start raising awareness for the habitat loss that kills millions of animals.  If zoos wanted to encourage the safety of wildlife, they should leave them in the wild where they are happy. Mental health is just as important as physical health.  'zoos have taken strides to increase human and wildlife safety.'  This supports nothing. Strides means nothing to the animals currently suffering in zoos. Up to 10,000 animals are killed for no reason in European zoos. That does not sound like wildlife safety to me.  And people can talk about education, conservation, and awareness, but the fact is that most zoos are not well respected institutions. They are roadside zoos or entertainment hubs that are NOT non-profit and strive to exploit these animals for their 'cuteness'. It is cruel and inhumane.

    <t>Every time you go to the zoo, you can see how much people are learning. As the spend a few seconds at each exhibit and often taunt the animals for entertainment. Of course, some people do not do this. But that doesn't make it any better. The fact remains, that no matter what zoos do in education or conservation (although they do not do much) they are torture for animals. For example, let's think about elephants. Elephants walk up to 30 miles a day in the wild. It is simply impossible to replicate their habitat in a zoo setting. And it is not natural or safe for them to be in zoos. Zoo animals show the public exactly how they are mentally tortured. You can see it in the way monkeys at zoos sway back and forth (zoochosis) or the way the lion or tiger paces for hours on end. You can see it in the collapsed fins and worn down teeth of the animals at Seaworld. It is simply /not ethical/ to do this to animals. And while a tree frog might not mind living in a zoo, you can bet a tiger hates every second. And let's not forget the endless visitors, camera flashes, and screaming children. It is no way to live.  And let's not forget that even in the best zoos, animals do not live happy enriched lives. They live slightly better lives than the ones in roadside zoos. But not by much.  I have fond memories of zoos, most people do. I remember when I was in a zoo camp and they let me make a salad for the giant tortoise and I got to go into the enclosure with these huge creatures. That was amazing. But I also remember crying as my parents took me to visit the tiger because it was just pacing. Back and forth, all day long. It broke my heart.  And as for conservation, you said it yourself. Few species are successfully reintroduced. And yes, animals can 'become threatened' but that is definitely not a valid reason to keep them caged up. Giraffes shouldn't be held in small cages because there is a small chance they might become endangered. It is, well, crazy! And let's not forget my other statistic I said, only 12% of zoos are actually registered for conservation.  'is it ethical for animals to suffer for the 'good' of their species?'  Well, would you stay locked in a small cage for the good of the human race? I doubt it.</t>

And even less of those endangered animals are actually helped by those programs. Only 12% of all the zoos in the world are actually registered for captive breeding or wildlife conservation.  3. Zoos are dangerous for animals and humans. Many animals in zoos present with forms of depression and psychosis. They also display self mutilation such as the orcas at seaworld gnawing at the side of their pool and wearing their teeth down to nubs.

    <t>I understand the argument.  First, 2050 is a projection given by Bill Gates for zero emissions throughout the whole world IF serious and drastic changes are made in reducing of C02 levels. It's not that they wouldn't take effect until 2050 but rather that humans have to work very hard to reach that point by 2050. I did not mean to attack that specific part of the argument but I just wanted to make that clear.  Now, with that being said, this ties into my argument which is that global warming is a greater issue than poverty.  That is, global warming is effecting us now, as I have said before. Drastic changes are already being made right now in order to make an attempt at reaching that goal of Zero C02 emissions by 2050. So, I must make it clear that climate change is a problem that is effecting all humans, right her and now.  Some current effects of climate change are... -Increased coastal flooding and sea level rise. -More damaging wildfires. -More severe droughts. -More severe deforestation. -More severe health risks to humans by pollution. This website run by the Union of Concerned Scientists evaluates the situation properly.  So, as far as the immediacy of this issue I would argue that is is more so than poverty because it effects everyone one on Earth and mostly because it takes LONGER to fix.  Poverty is an immediate issue currently effecting many people but climate change is also immediate and will take much longer to resolve.  Finally, I would also like to state that the solutions for climate change coincide with the solutions for poverty. Just as an example, the Tesla Power Wall allows consumers to store energy that is collected by solar panels, and use it anytime they want. This will prove to be extremely useful for underdeveloped areas which are not anywhere near a power grid.  In reference to that statement, I argue that solving the climate change issue first would be more beneficial to the human race than attempting the vice-versa option which you are arguing. While I agree that educating people will lead to the reduction of global climate change, I think that by the time every underdeveloped country catches up in education, it will be too late for the earth.  With that, I do believe that global climate change is a greater issue than poverty, and that focusing attention on that would be better for the human race.</t>

    <t>Firstly I would like to apologize to my opponent for missing the last round. it was not my intention to miss the debate, simply the fact that time river and my studies in school demand much of its water.  Now on to my argument  Climate change is an issue. It is definitely going to have major consequences on us in the future if we don't do anything. However, Poverty, education, and hunger are all immediate issues. People are suffering right now and dying right now because of it.  I believe that by declaring war on poverty, lack of knowledge, and hunger, the consequences given by climate change will be much reduced if not completely removed  Firstly, People who are educated poorly practice bad habits that could be avoided if they were properly educated. for example, the practices of mass chopping of trees, excessive fishing, and actions that produce emissions are performed by those who do not know the full extent of what can be caused in the future if they do not change their ways.  Also, educating more people puts more minds to work on solutions to the issues at hand. By putting more effort into allowing people in poverty to obtain the financial recourses to obtain an education, more people will be at work armed with knowledge to help combat climate change.  Which leads me to my next point; poverty. Poverty can be defined as 'a financial state in which one is not able obtain the basic necessities such as food, water, clothing, etc.'. As in your earlier statement, the issues from climate change is a long term issue with plans that don't take effect until 2050, while poverty is causing people to suffer right now. By lessening poverty, we reduce crime rates, increase overall happiness, and make the country more progressive in every way such as services and infrastructure. More jobs, and the economy will roll, allowing people to buy more things, and once again, improve technology.  As for convincing me as a debater, You would have to prove to me that Climate change is a more immediate problem, and that solving it would create more of an overall benefit for the human race  Once again im sorry for not being present for the previous round and i will do my best to be present for the final round</t>

    <t>I thank my opponent for this opportunity. I will be arguing against the statement that 'Global Poverty, Education, and hunger are greater issues than global climate change.' I will begin by defining my terms and clarifying my argument:  Poverty: The state or condition of having little or no money, goods, or means of support; condition of being poor.  Education: The act or process of imparting or acquiring general knowledge, developing the powers of reasoning and judgment, and generally of preparing oneself or others intellectually for mature life.  Hunger :A compelling need or desire for food.  Greater: Unusually or comparatively large in size or dimensions.  Issue: A point in question or a matter that is in dispute, as between contending parties in an action at law.  Climate change: A long-term change in the earth's climate, especially a change due to an increase in the average atmospheric temperature.  All definitions were directly quoted from Dictionary.com. The context of all key terms and words should be understood otherwise I will further elaborate.  When the instigator refers to the issue of education I am assuming that they are talking about the lack of free education in specific countries. Also, I assume that hunger is an Issue that is attached to poverty as a result. With that being said, I understand that lack of education and hunger are typically effects that are caused by poverty.  I am arguing against this claim because I do not believe that it is true. I do believe that poverty is a serious issue. I do believe that every country should allow free education through the 12 grade. I also believe that hunger and death from malnutrition are Important issues.  But, I argue that none of these three issues are as important as Climate change. Here's why: Poverty, and the issues surrounding it such as hunger and education effect a select few. Climate change effects every single person living on Earth and every single person who ever will live on Earth.  That is my argument, I look forward to this debate.</t>

I would also like to provide more evidence: In a TED talk by Bill Gates called 'Innovating to Zero,' the richest man on earth describes the movement towards Zero C02 emissions by 2050. The way that this will happen is through the expansion of renewable energy infrastructure. Now, in reference to this talk, Bill Gates claims that this effort will also greatly reduce poverty as an extra beneficial result. The biggest reason why this is true is because renewable energy structures, in areas of poverty, will greatly increase the standard of living. This is because small villages and communities of extreme poverty are not usually anywhere near an energy grid.</t>

    <t>Sorry for my long delay, I have been busy  Argument: While it is true that currently the climb of global warming is slow, just wait for the 'point of no return.' Haven't heard of it? There are multiple website talking about it, so go search it up. Anyway, the point of no return is basically the fact that when global warming reaches a point of badness, it will tumble, pick up speed, and there will be no way to stop it. One example of this are the polar ice caps melting. As more ice melts, there is more water to attract warmth. As the water gets warmer, the ice melts faster. See how that could tumble out of control? Now, how does this have to do with anything? Well, there will be a 'runaway' in global warming. What is currently a really small amount increase per year, could very well become catastrophic, maybe even 0.5 degrees a year. And it will be near impossible to stop it. If things don't change by 2020, we will hit the point of no return by 2042. Rising temperatures can cause major drought and wildfires (just look at California,) and it can even cause computers to over heat. Imagine what would happen if hospital machines, machines keeping people alive, over heated because of the 120 or so degree Fahrenheit temperatures that could be seen if we don't stop global warming from tipping to the deep end. If all of a sudden, there were no more wars, how would we get everyone to get together, be friends, and stop global warming in such a small time frame. Remember, most of the world's economies rely of burning coal and oil, which causes global warming. So, even if everyone unified all of a sudden, which isn't very likely, there would be a huge risk of destroying all economies to fix it. And if everyone destroy's their economy to fix global warming, how can they help the others with dead economies. Huh, not very black and white, is it?</t>

    <t>First off, Pro states that plants would be shriveling and dying because of the greater temperature. I'd like to point out that while that is a sobering possibility, it wouldn't be happening anywhere in the near future. According to the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, the global temperature has risen 1.53 (Fahrenheit) since the Industrial Revolution. In about two and a half centuries, our global temperature has only gone up by that non-remarkable amount (0.00612 per year). In 50 years, our global temperature will have risen only .3 degrees Fahrenheit. I don't believe that's a large enough amount to carry any significance in it.  As for the prospect of weighing human lives on a scale, so many more lives would be saved if we were to have world peace. Pro states that wars only occur every 20 or so years and cause tens of millions of inexcusable deaths, however, global warming causes 400,000 deaths a year. I'd like to point out that these figures are questionable, and that even if tens of millions of people did die in these 'superwars' that occur every other decade, the proportion of deaths per year is greater by that of which caused by war. (ten million / 20 = 500,000).  Next, wars don't occur just every 20 years. Especially from our developed country's biased eye, we love to twist figures. Our globe is in chaos right now. Just look at the Yemen Civil War or the infamous ISIS fight. It doesn't take an extremely bloody war to capture our attention.  We have the power to destroy ourselves right now, and the only thing stopping us from doing so is the knowledge that others contain that power also.  War is a terrible thing, and world cooperation would be the easiest solution to our problems.</t>

    <t>Alright. First things first (I'm the realest..gosh that song's old), if we were to ensure the cooperation of our world organization, then we could accomplish so much more! Our world is run on money and competition. Greed is embodied into our human nature. However, if we were to collaborate, we could tackle this problem of global warming together. Thus, world peace places a higher priority on our list than global warming. Next, let's again remind ourselves that the rate of increase in temperature is 0.00612 degrees Fahrenheit per year. This minuscule figure tells us that we should have nothing to worry about. Therefore, I'd like to kindly remind Pro to chill out (pun intended) and remember that the world isn't anywhere near falling over the pit yet. Because of our natural urge to want more for ourselves, yes, we do fight wars over resources. Pro states it himself-they can contribute to the fire that fuels the flame for a war. However, we are nowhere near burning up.  Therefore, I conclude my argument, and thus, the debate, with the notion that our society as the human race should focus on discontinue our quarrels and turn our eyes to the greater issues.

That's going to be hard to fix if all the plants are shriveling and dying because of the over-livable heat! Many websites say that if global warming was stopped, it would help world peace a lot. Oil and coal are major contributors in a strong economy, and can be a large point in a war. If we stop global warming by not burning and using the resources, we no longer have that strong reason to go to war. Also, global warming is causing a lot more than fiercer storms. Lots of people may die in wars, but how many people are dying by abnormally large tsunamis and hurricanes, which are larger due to global warming. War happens once every 20 or so years and kill a few ten million each time, which is a lot and is inexcusable. Global warming, however, kills about 400,000 people a year[1] (through means of tsunamis, hurricanes, etc.), and that number is constantly growing. True, it currently doesn't kill as many as wars do, but what about in 50 years? </t>

    <t>Global Warming. It is our biggest issue. I didn't choose world peace because we were always be fighting. For as long as we have lived, we have fought. And yet, we are still alive and 'healthy'. Global warming, on the other hand, is a new problem. A new problem that isn't going away. Our ice caps are melting, raising our temperatures and killing hundreds of arctic animals. By raising temperatures, it's evaporating more water, making the ground dryer, making it harder for plants to grow. Less plants, less food, less people. Not to mention the fact that it's incredibly uncomfortable to be in super hot weather. Plus, if global warming is stopped by no longer burning oil, there is no longer the danger of what would happen if there is no more oil to burn. In short, wars will always be a problem, but it will never threaten our extinction. Unless stopped, global warming will.</t>

    <t>To consider this resolution and evaluate both possible solutions a few things must be established. Firstly, the main value that both sides are defending is the value of human life. The common goal is saving the most possible humans. The pro side will be arguing that preparation is fundamental and necessary to achieve this while the con should be arguing that reducing the damage to the environment is enough. Before I lay out my arguments I would like to make one clarification: the pro side is not arguing that prevention is the ultimate solution. Instead, we will prove that it should be the immediate and necessary action.  These are our reasons:  1. We will suffer the consequences of climate change. (It will rise above 2 C).  The vast majority of scientists agree that a rise in the average temperature of the world above 2 degrees Celsius from before industrial levels will be extremely catastrophic to the human population. This is a very alarming fact because we have already risen 1 degree above these industrial levels, and from the current course we have set our industries on, it is virtually impossible to prevent going above 2 C. This means we WILL deal with the catastrophic damage of climate change! Now the question is what is the best solution to deal with these consequences such as extreme droughts, flooding, harsh storms, etc.? The solution proposed by the the opposition is completely inviable since switching to green energy or any other measure will not save the lives of the people whose house was washed away by floods or who do not have water to drink. I'm from Brazil and recently we have had the worst drought in 50 years. This made a many people realize the importance of the environment and start taking actions to help it, yet that did not solve the immediate problem. People still did not have water to live! Preparation was necessary and would have remediated the issue. This same logic can be applied to the rest of the world. We need to be prepared to face what is coming, and that is why it should be our main goal.  2. Not all nations will agree on preventing climate change; therefore, nations that do not prepare for its effects will be harmed.  One example of this is China, one of the biggest producers of greenhouse gases, which has recently stated that it would not maintain its emission control pledges. As a result of that, it is inevitable that significant damage will occur due to climate change. It is nearly impossible to force countries like this to comply with climate change prevention measures; therefore, it would be more beneficial for the other nations to prepare themselves to the effects of climate change rather than spending trillions on trying to prevent it in vain. How can you ask a small country like the Maldives to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions when the sea is rising and destroying their cities? Even if they did agree to take these measures, because other countries like China don't, the seas will continue to rise. Their main concern currently should be to prepare with the effects of this rise.  3. It would be illogical for a few countries to make the change to green technology because of the magnitude of capital investment in the oil amp; gas industry.  The oil amp; gas industry is a billion dollar industry. Only in the time period 2009-13 more than 3000 billion dollars were invested in the oil amp; gas industry. It is needless to point out the huge negative effects the adoption of green technology would mean for the world economy. The results would be catastrophic and there would be no turning back. Thousands of people would lose their jobs and years of technological developments in the industry would be wasted. It would cost 44 trillion dollars to switch from fossil fuels to green energy. The cost of this is unviable. There are no investors willing to spend that much money on green technology. Logically, the costs would be split. However, given the profits the oil industry brings only a crazy person would spend on green technology. This once again demonstrates how prevention is completely impossible in our world and preparation is the best immediate solution.  4. If climate change prevention does not work, then mankind would have wasted all of its resources into something futile, and we would not be able to survive the effects of climate change.  In order to change the ways of mankind now, we would have to change so many habits that have been ingrained in our society for decades, since the discovery of oil. How we run our factories, how we trade, change all of the packaging on foods, beauty products, even clothing. It is impossible to impede the productions of these items, since nowadays fossil fuels are present all around us. The keyboard you are typing on is made of plastic for example, the case around your phone is plastic as well. It is incoherent to assume that we can slow this process now, so instead of spending trillions on prevention methods that we are not certain can work (they haven't until now), we must start thinking about the future, and preparing for the worst that can come. One of the largest mistakes that humanity makes is to begin something and not look deep enough into the future to know how to control that something. This is not a fatalistic view, it is a cautious one.  For all these reasons, we are arguing that the preparation to deal with climate change should currently be valued above preventing the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Arguing that suddenly changing the path we are on will happen and is viable is thinking of a utopian world. It is a completely inviable solution. The main goal of nations should be to prepare, and later, when the mentality concerning climate change starts to shift, prevention can be discussed.</t>

    <t>No one is denying that climate change is upon us. The present effects of global warming and other forms of climate change are well documented. As we see it, the people of the world have two choices: --shore up our defenses against the worst effects of climate change and hope that we won't eventually be incapable of coping with the rising seas, floods, droughts, disease, etc. that are even now threatening communities on every continent, or  --focus our energies and resources on preventing further climate change damage to mitigate the impact on humanity and planet.  Given the ominous fact that there is nothing that can be done to immediately halt and reverse the effects of climate change, humans need to take the long view. Where will we be in 50 or 100 years if we fail to take steps now to prevent even greater climate change? The effects we are feeling now are so threatening to human health and the ecosystems we depend upon that it is inconceivable we could survive many generations at the current rate of damage. The alternative to real and concerted prevention of further climate change, is to accept a future in which the people of Earth who are not killed by heat waves, mosquito-born diseases, floods, famines and the other inevitable effects of global warming find themselves fighting over the few verdant patches of land high enough to escape seas that have risen [find stat] feet once the polar ice caps have melted completely. The preparation position is a fatalistic one. It accepts the eventual demise of humankind. The only viable position is the prevention of further climate change in hopes of reestablishing ecological balance in the world. No amount of raising levees, recycling water, or distributing mosquito nets will be sufficient over time to save our race and the world from the climate change damage we have put in motion. Given a choice between preparing for the worst, and attempting to prevent the worst--humanity's best hope lies in prevention. We must do everything we can, starting now, to halt the shameful dependence on fossil fuels, the destruction of tropical rainforests, and pumping of hydrocarbons into the air.</t>

It’s essentially a myth being perpetuated by the ignorant. [2] Social Media: “These things possesses a danger of sharing any sensitive information in a blink of eyes  .“ -Pro Pro is referring to the potential of sensitive information being shared on social media. The issue with this is that users on social media have the choice to post as they please. It is their own fault and responsibility if their information is leaked, not the fault of technology. The cases of unwanted events being shared in the form of cyberbullying are so limited that it has virtually no effect on the human race in total. Pro fails to address that essentially ~75% of human beings don’t even use social media (not including bots or sockpuppets that have social media accounts, which I didn’t mention previously). [see previous figures in R1] Deadly Weapons amp; The Atomic Bomb: Whether or not the creation of deadly weapons and the usage of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki are bad is both questionable and subjective. Not fact, as Pro claims in their conclusion. War: Simply put, war is perpetuated by human beings, not by technology. The complete removal of technology would not end war. If technology never even existed, war would still go on. That is human nature.Pro’s arguments are flawed and my primary points remain virtually unrefuted. Pro’s conclusion states that his points are facts when in reality, most of them are extremely subjective and nothing more than opinions. Pro also used a strawman logical fallacy in the end of their conclusion in an effort to make some points I brought up earlier seem notably more ridiculous and unimportant.

Economic benefits- Houses close to parks are on average 8% more expensive than similar properties further away. Greener cities attract more visitors, whose spending on shopping and leisure generates job opportunities. Health benefits-People who use green spaces are more likely to take exercise than those who don't, and that the attractiveness or quality of green space is important: people don't want to use neglected parks or open spaces. The more time people spend outdoors the less stressed they feel ' an important consideration given the cost to the UK economy of depression and mental illness, which has been calculated at '26.1bn. Social benefits-Academic studies tend to support the relationship between well maintained local green spaces and people's feeling of belonging. People who live near green spaces are more likely to feel a sense of attachment. In Zurich, researchers found youths were more likely to meet and make friends with people from non-Swiss backgrounds in the city's parks.

    <t>== Intro ==  A carbon tax is a tax levied on the carbon content of fuels, which results in most carbon emissions -- emissions of carbon dioxide, which increases temperature, and occasionally carbon monoxide, which is toxic. The resolution says the United States should introduce a carbon tax.  The government legislates pragmatically, based on what benefits and harms the people. The job of the State is to ensure that the people aren't harmed. Thus, government legislation ought to be based on John Stuart Mill's 'harm principle,' which holds that the only purpose for which control can be exercised over a person who doesn't consent to it is to prevent harm to non-consensual others. There are two reasons to accept this. First, the only reason people recognize the government's legitimacy is to prevent harm to themselves and to maximize benefit for themselves. If the government doesn't follow the harm principle, it is illegitimate. Second, the harm principle fits with normal conceptions of ethics in that it prevents harm.  What are the burdens in this debate? The debate is a normative resolution, which means the burdens of persuasion are shared. The word 'should' implies a debate of opinions, and, therefore, requires both sides to justify that opinion. My burden is to show that a carbon tax would be a net benefit to society. Con's burden is to show that it would be a net harm.  == Climate change ==  Global warming is primarily human-caused and poses a fairly significant threat to humanity. Most scientists agree on that. The scientific consensus on climate change is that it's primarily human-caused. Human-emitted greenhouse gases trap insolation within the Earth, and increase its mean temperature. Carbon dioxide has a huge impact on temperature. Research by most scientists confirms so. Leading climatologist JD Annan uses a Bayesian statistical approach, which is 'dominant in the literature,' and finds that mean temperature would increase by 3 degrees Celsius per doubling of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. [1] That would mean carbon dioxide is responsible for around 70% of global warming.  The effects of climate change on humans is severe. There's immense urgency as to the effect of climate change, and the problem is on a huge scale. If greenhouse emissions continue at the current rate, climate change will make the planet uninhabitable to humans. [2]  A carbon tax would act to mitigate global warming. With a tax on carbon emissions, it will deter people from using carbon-content fuels at high levels, therefore reducing carbon emissions. Carbon taxation is not very costly, and has been proven to be effective at reducing emissions, therefore mitigating the threat of global warming. Research has shown that Norway's carbon tax has reduced carbon-based pollution by 20%. [3]  == Nuclear power ==  Implementing a carbon tax will deter people from using carbon-based fuels. That much has been established by lots of research, and has been observed in Norway's carbon tax. Logically, it entails that people will look for alternatives. Most people agree that nuclear power will present significant competition to coal energy if a carbon tax is enacted. [4] Nuclear power poses a net benefit to society. Nuclear power further helps mitigate the threat of climate change. It's more efficient than many other forms of energy, and produces the most electricity in relation to it's minimal environmental impact.  Nuclear power is helpful, because it has very little pollution and poses a viable power source. Therefore, it's a benefit to the plan.  Climate change poses a harm to people. A carbon tax would mitigate that harm. The government's job is to prevent or reduce harm. For those reasons, vote Pro. </t>

    <t>I'm disappointed that my opponent forfeited. It's considered common courtesy that you have a no-forfeit guarantee when you apply in the comments section of the debate. I'll crystallize my points and show you why you should vote Pro:  There's immense urgency to the crisis of climate change now. Temperatures are rising at rates much faster than people think. Carbon dioxide concentrations are constantly rising, and if they're doubled, it'll mean a three-degree Celsius rise in temperature. At the current rate of carbon emissions, the human race will go extinct. I understand that there are studies doubting the impact of global warming, and many researchers think the climate sensitivity is at 1.1 degrees Celsius. But there are various studies that show much higher climate sensitivities. Many of these studies use climate models, which many skeptical researchers -- and even some members on this site who believe in anthropogenic global warming, such as 16k -- doubt, but the consensus is that climate models work. And there are many non-modeling studies as well, such as the one I cited by JD Annan, that uses a Bayesian statistical approach, which is the dominant method in the literature. All of these entail a major urgency to climate change.  Of course, many people -- even those who actually acknowledge this -- just sit in front of their computers debating, and don't stop to ponder how huge the impact is. It's enormous. Stop for a second and close your eyes, and imagine if conditions were as I'm saying. Don't just think 'ok, this is a debate, this is fun to read,' or don't be just a judge for this debate, or a person who's interested. Think as a person who actually cares for the race, and for their own lives. Imagine heat waves everywhere killing many. Imagine floods, many more storms, and multiple phenomena causing them. Many satirists have jokes -- extremely realistic ones -- on how people just care about those that died in a flood just for those two weeks or so. I, like most other humans, was like that; I cared, but I soon forgot. Until I experienced the devastation caused by floods, and witnessed the sheer human fear and panic that's so inherent. Just post the Chennai floods, there was a rumor that a dam's wall had collapsed -- and at that moment, those that had lost so much just ran, and you could see the fear in their faces. The rumor was a false one. But that helped me appreciate how serious any loss is. Nearly dying changes nothing. Someone else dying changes nothing. But dying changes everything. Ponder for a moment about that, and imagine the sheer impact caused by climate change. That can be mitigated by a carbon tax.  Imagine the reduction in fear. Think of that slight mitigation that could prevent the brutal, horrifying specter of change and death. Just creating a tax would stop that. It would mitigate heat waves and flooding. 'Burning all fossil fuels . . . would make most of this planet uninhabitable to humans.' [2] That's why you should vote Pro. The magnitude of the impact is so immense, it's close to nuclear impacts in 'North Korea vs Iran' policy debates. I'm sure most people didn't imagine a debate about taxation comes to that -- but it does.  Nuclear power is another, smaller, impact. There's little question that nuclear power is immensely beneficial to society. It doesn't pollute much, there's a very low risk of emergency scenarios, and it benefits the economy. A carbon tax increases that. It's much simpler than the above impact.  For these reasons, vote Pro.</t>

    <t>The word 'main' as used in the debate heading presents the position that humanity's contribution to global warming is greater in magnitude than any other factor. The definition of 'main' could be explained as: chief or principal in rank, importance, size, etc. Therefore, Pro must prove that the human portion is in fact the largest of factors. Of course, the human portion needn't be greater than 50% of the total effect if there are multiple elements/factors at play. I also agree that it is more than possible that human activities could affect, change or initiate natural processes, but again, that would have to be quantified (what portion of a natural system has been altered by human elements versus natural change). Natural and human effect can be intertwined and extremely complicated, if not impossible to differentiate and separate. This is referred to as the 'attribution of recent climate change'. I will reference the following scholarly article. 'Detection and Attribution of Recent Climate Change: A Status Report'. The authors make several important conclusions in this comprehensive study: 'Greenhouse warming alone is insufficient to explain the observed pattern of climate change.' and 'The most probable cause of the observed warming is a combination of internally and externally forced natural variability and anthropogenic sources (see also Tett et al. 1999). But given the large model uncertainties and limited data, a reliable weighting of the different factors contributing to the observed climate change cannot currently be given. In short, we cannot attribute, at this time, with a high level of statistical significance, the observed changes in global and large-scale regional climate to anthropogenic forcing alone.'. This research contradicts Pro's assertion that human causes are definitively more important than natural ones. In addition, to say that our current warming trend was caused solely by the industrial age based on the chart I presented (in round 3) would be to dismiss the fact that the sharp rebound from the Little Ice Age and commencement of our current warming trend (1600-) was initiated and occurred well before human activity was a relevant factor. I agree with much of the content contained within the two sites referenced by pro, but none of them contains information that establishes that human activity plays a greater role than natural variability. The CO2 now website asserts that 'The human impact on climate during this era greatly exceeds that due to known changes in natural processes, such as solar changes and volcanic eruptions.' and lists several of the unique contributions and circumstances associated with human activity and greenhouse gasses. It also states that 'the radiative forcing from human activities is much more important for current and future climate change than the estimated radiative forcing from changes in natural processes.' These are grand statements, but there is no attempt to quantify them unlike the formal research document I presented above (which contradicts these sites). There is also no mention on Pro's sites of the fact that our current warming period was initiated well before the industrial age and human influence by natural forces. Even the IPCC continues to protect its reputation by using vague terms such as '...likely' regarding the position of humanity's '...dominant role in global warming'. I acknowledge that we currently are experiencing global warming. For those who lived in 1100 BC and 1300 AD, they also experienced global warming on a larger scale than we do today, even though human activity had little correlation to that warming. Thus, to say that Global Warming is unique to the industrial age is false. It is also very likely that scientists will one day be able to prove/quantify what portion of Human Activity is attributable to global warming. Presently, it is not possible as my opponent acknowledges. This is why no scientist(s) or scientific body has declared a victory on this issue (A quantified attribution of recent climate change). In fact, a very large amount of money and large amount of research continues to be spent on this very issue because it has yet to be proved or resolved. I also agree that the current warming period presented on the on the chart I referenced is abrupt and is likely a reflection of the influence of human activity. Being that this warming period has yet to exceed several recent warming periods in effect and duration, we need more time in order to be able to place our current warming period into the context of other prior larger warming periods. It is simply premature to state definitively that human activity is the main factor in global warming. My statement is reflected in the current feverish rate of research being performed into the Attribution of Recent Climate Change. If a definitive conclusion had been reached, this research would not be needed to such a degree. Keep in mind, that I am not advocating that humanity should not take responsibility towards reducing our greenhouse gas emissions; quite the contrary.</t>

    <t>I never said that Mankind is the sole cause of global warming. I'm saying they are the main cause of global warming. According to the chart provided by Con in the previous argument, we are supposed going through a clod period. Then how come that 14 of the 15 hottest years are in the 21st century? This is shown in Wiki page of Global Warming. Therefore I respectfully say that the site might be wrong. Its true , there have been cold periods every year. But I think those are called winters. Another reason. Global Warming is primarily caused by emission of GHGs, or Greenhouse gases. The primary sources of GHGs are factories and automobiles . Which are human sources. The only major contributor from the natural side are trees which only emit CO2 during the night. Whereas human sources include, CO, CO2, nitrous oxide, methane and other synthetic chemicals emitted is vapour form by humans. And with the tree population declining, and not many volcanoes in the past 10 years, the GHG emission by nature are not that significant as mankind. And contrary to common perception there has not been any cool period, the average surface temperature of the planet has been constantly increasing. The concentration of CO2 has been up about 20% from 650,000 years ago. Con has failed to rebut the argument of radioactive forcing which was in one of my sources. Just because its contribution cannot be quantified, doesn't mean it is not the major contributor. In the above site, research has indicated that natural causes do not explain the recent climate changes . ( Ever since the Industrial Revolution). The site also gives the natural causes of climate change. 1)Variations in the sun's energy reaching Earth 2)Changes in the reflectivity of Earth's atmosphere and surface 3)Changes in the greenhouse effect, which affects the amount of heat retained by Earth's atmosphere 1)Its true that there have been changes in the Sun's energy reaching the Earth but none big enough to cause such a change in surface temperature ALONE. 2) The constant GHG emissions have damaged our ozone layer and are causing UV rays to enter the atmosphere which is also increase the temperature of the planet. Again . A human source. 3) The changes in the GreenHouse effect, is that we humans have been constantly increasing the amount of GHGs in the atmosphere in our quest for development and comfort. A human source. 4) There have been no volcanic eruptions, atleast not big enough for the atmosphere to change and for the aerosol count to become so high. Therefore one can conclude that a human source is now behind almost every natural cause that MAY have caused this spike in temperature. Therefore Humanity is the Main Cause of Global Warming.</t>

    <t>First of all I would like to apologise for themy forfeiture, as my internet connection was not available for a few days. I hope that voters disregard the forfeit. My opening statements. 1) Humanity IS the main cause of global warming.The IPCC Report of 2015 states: Its extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 wascaused by the anthropogenic increase in GHG concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together. The best estimate of the human-induced contribution to warming is similar to the observed warming over this period . Anthro-pogenic forcings have likely made a substantial contribution to surface temperature increases since the mid-20th century over every continental region except Antarctica.. Anthropogenic influences have likely affected the global water cycle since 1960 and contributed to the retreat of glaciers since the 1960s and to the increased surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet since 1993. Anthropogenic influences have very likely contributed to Arctic sea-ice loss since 1979 and have very likely made a substantial contribution to increases in global upper ocean heat content (0''700 m) and to global mean sea level rise observed since the 1970s.'One of the major contributions to global warming is caused by automobiles, a man made i.e. anthropogenic industry.Other include garbage disposal, factories, burning of leaves , bonfires etc. All of these are anthropogenic causes. 2) One could argue that global warming would take place with or without humanity , but that is not and would not have been the case. Global warming is not JUST the warming of the Earth , it is the EXCESSIVE warming of the Earth's atmosphere. 3) The following site also concludes that mankind is the main contributing factor of global warming. My Rebuttals 1) Con's source itself says that human activities have contributed substantially to climate change I.e. global warming. 2) I didn't know that global warming consisted of parts. Global warming, simply put is the heating up of the earth, which is mainly caused by greenhouse gases which are emitted by both anthropogenic and natural sources. But the amount is substantially more by man made sources. 3) Another reason given by Con's site is the sun's reflectivity , which can also be altered by human activities. 4) This debate is not whether this is the Little Ice Age or any other age. Its about mankind's impact on global warming. 5) Even if the role of Ice Age is as important as it is alleged, it cannot overtake the impact of civilization and development.</t>

    <t>I will restate, than in order to establish that the primary cause of global warming is human activity, it is necessary to quantify the amount and effect (not qualify). No scientist or scientific body to date, to my knowledge, has been able to do so. Specifically, anyone making the assertion that humans are the primary cause of global warming must scientifically establish/prove what percentage is human as compare to natural variability and natural causes. It is not good enough to use terms such as 'significant' and 'substantially' as they are extremely vague inconclusive terms. An even worse approach is to take the line of reasoning presented on the timeforchange.org site referenced by my opponent, which virtually ignores the question/possibility of natural factors. I will reference the following chart by Climatologist Cliff Harris and Meteorologist Randy Mann to illustrate my position. Note that on this chart there have been two periods with higher and more prolonged global warming periods in 1100 BC and 1300 AD (up to two-fold greater). My opponent also dismissed the importance of the naturally occurring little ice-age, yet its effect was over three-fold greater than our so called current 'human' caused warming period. Being that natural causes are scientifically established to have created global temperature swings 3 times larger, and hundreds of years longer in duration than our current warming period (as recent as 1600 - 1800 AD), it is complete pseudo-science to claim that natural cycles play an insignificant role in global temperature change. In fact, being that we are presently in a period where we would naturally expect to see a warming period in the natural global temperature cycle, one would expect that human activity would have created the largest warming event in the last 5000 years. The chart/link I presented establishes that this kind of warming simply hasn't happened. The evidence I presented could even be used as an argument that Mankind's impact on global warming is negligible as compared to natural variability. Lastly, I acknowledge that my sources attribute a portion of climate change to human activity, but again, 'significant' and 'substantially' is not a quantification as I asserted earlier. I would ask that my opponent reference scholarly material that definitively establishes that human activity outweighs all other possible natural elements and variables in global climate change.</t>

    <t>Firstly. I have not quantified anything in the heading of the debate. I've said 'main cause'. Not 'more than fifty percent' or somethinglike that. Main means a major portion. Since when did 'substantially' get used for a small portion? And it is also not my possible (to my knowledge) to quantify the impact of natural causes on climate change as it is unpredictable and can change any time. Con has also left out my point that human activities can alter the natural conditions of the earth, therefore any change in temperature due to natural causes could have a human factor behind it. As explained in the following.  Secondly, I never said natural causes play an insignificant role. I said they play an important role but not as important as human causes. In con's reference chart, the temperature has been constantly oscillating between hot and cold, but if you check recent years there have been almost two constant hot periods and the cold period is almost invisible ( in the graph I mean) meaning it is very short. And then in the graph itself it clear that the hot periods have been on the rise since the Age of Induatrialization. And after 2015, the cold period is based on assumptions and predictions, and as I have already made clear that nature cannot always be predicted. Thirdly Global Warming is a reality. Just because there have hotter periods before, doesn't mean it is not happening. The following site also explains that the global warming hiatus in recent times is not true. And that climate only causes short term changes in the climate of the earth, but human activity causes long term changes. Fourthly scientists will not quanitfy and agree that mankind is responsible for global warming, as it is their community that are primary responsible (in humans). But I will not defame them as some ARE trying their best to prove it. Fifthly , again I refer to the chart provided by Con, the hot periods have gradually developed over a period of time, but in recent years its almost at a right angle. Which means there have been sharp and quick increase in the heat all over the globe.</t>

    <t>Yes, I agree with Pro's sources in Round 5 that list all of the ways in which human activity plays a role in affecting global climate. Unfortunately, Pro failed to acknowledge the issue of 'Attribution of Recent Climate Change' which I brought up in Round 4. Without doing so, it is impossible to conclude that '...Humanity is the Main Cause of Global Warming' as Pro has done. To further bolster my argument, I will reference the 376 page scholarly book (published in 2015) 'Climate Change, Multidecadal and Beyond' which flatly states outright in the introduction 'Many questions concerning the nature and causes of climate variability on the multidecadal time scale are still unresolved.'. This book also references a Technical Summary of the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report which acknowledges 'Difficulties remain in attributing temperature changes at smaller than continental scales and over time scales less than 50 years.' (Solomon et al., 2007). While generalist websites for the public (such as the ones referenced by pro) may ignore the issue of attribution, clearly scholars and climate scientists cannot and do not. The book I referenced demonstrates that scientists are working very hard on the attribution issue, and may resolve it in the near future thanks to ever improving technology, statistics and modeling. However, being that the world's top scientists have not resolved the issue of climate change attribution, it is far too premature for 'pro' declare a victory or a conclusion that humanity is the 'main' cause of climate change (based on the information contained in generalist websites), especially in the context of a Multidecadal view. I was very much hoping that Pro would address the issue of 'Attribution of Recent Climate Change' which I introduced in Round 4. In conclusion, I would like to thank my opponent for a robust and civil debate on this important issue.</t>

    <t>In deference to my opponents forfeiture of the first round, I would make the opening statement for this debate. I do not dispute the existence and reality of Global Warming. I do assert, however, that it is impossible to quantify on a global scale, what part of global warming is attributable to Human activities as compared to natural change. Therefore, to state that humanity is the main cause of global warming is, at time present, impossible to prove. Geographers and Geologists consider the state of the Earth at time present to be in an ice age, albeit a late stage. This means that there have been periods in the history of the earth with less ice coverage, higher sea levels, and warmer mean global temperatures. As an example, a major component of the Glacial retreat we are witnessing today is attributable to natural rebound from the little ice age (approximately 1300 to 1850). Certainly human activity has amplified this rebound, but to what degree is indefinable. There are also many other potential amplifying factors, a few of which are listed on the Environmental Protection Agencies Website. Note, that even this reputable website is unable to quantify human contribution vs natural causes. I will also cite an article on the little ice-age for the benefit of my opponent. I would also refer my opponent to the regional research of Glaciologist Dr. Johannes Koch regarding glacial retreat in Garibaldi Park (and other regional locations) which document the geological evidence of glacial retreat since the Little Ice Age glacial extant. The immense role of the Little Ice Age on climate is well established in this research.</t>

    <t>Framework:Economic Globalization: “The trans-national increase in trade and capital transfers across national boundaries.” If I can prove economic globalization will have a net negative effect, I win. If my opponent proves the converse, he/she wins. Environmental Concerns:Generally, as income increases, so does production and consumption. These trends facilitate a rampant increase in pollution. Obviously, pollution isn’t something that is a net positive for society or for environment, as environment destruction has a subsequent negative effect on society. Pollution, as it is increased by economic globalization, creates an “Inverse-U” graph of environmental decay, called the Kuznets Curve. Environmental degradation is an irreversible cost of economic globalization, as demonstrated by the graph below. Essentially, when economic globalization begins, the short-term effects on environment are empirically harmful. However, assuming economic globalization is successful in poverty reduction, the curve is completed and environmental degradation slows. Regardless, the initial impact on environment is irreversible and extremely harmful. For the preservation of the environment, it’s imperative we don’t utilize economic globalization as an international policy.This point is important, and I think it needs further explanation. It’s necessary to understand the effects of globalization are far-reaching, not confined to developed or developing countries. It applies to both of them, and that’s a basis for global environmental degradation. Though some proponent’s of economic globalization assert the Kuznet’s curve flattens its environmental effects, this does not include CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions. Increase in production and consumption and easily induce further CO2 emissions, which subsequently results in global warming. There is “No evidence that Kuznet’s curve for CO2 ever turns down on its own.” [1]Global warming is a subsequent effect of CO2 [2], and it’s generally common knowledge -- being backed by empirical studies [3] CO2 emissions are generally and primarily caused by increased production, which is what economic globalization facilitates. If it increases production, the only logical consequence is then furthered global warming.Besides CO2 emissions, SO2 (sulfur oxide) emissions, which are pollutants [5], are another facet of considerable concern in regards to economic globalization. Yong S. Cho of Korea University explained in a study that there exists “a negative long-run relationship between SO2 emissions and income for developed countries…” [4] This clearly isn’t a positive consequence as there is less income. Even with SO2 emissions regressing, the effect on developing countries outweighs this slight benefit. The study continues, “while trade liberalization appears to increase environmental quality in developed economies, it has a detrimental effect on environmental quality in most developing countries.” Essentially, slight reduction in SO2 emissions in developed countries has little effect when weighed against *increased* emissions in developing countries and long-term lower income in developed nations.Aside from these two specific negative impacts, the total impact is negative, as indicated by studies. The foundation of this conclusion rests on one main point: the “race-to-the-bottom” theory, which will be addressed in further contentions. Because of this, the environmental degradation facilitated by economic globalization is both highly detrimental and irreversible.Labor Implications:The “race-to-the-bottom” theory is essentially constructed of the idea that “to the extent that countries are open to international trade and investment, environmental standards will be lower than they would otherwise be.” [6] Competition is a primary factor of economics and the standards by which corporations and countries lead their policies and practices. When competition becomes international rather than limited to nation-wide, companies lower labor standards to compensate for increased competition. Lowered labor standards facilitate and directly alter labor practices in a regressive manner. The graph above exemplifies the impact of lower labor standards on practices, and demonstrates the regressive trend over a period of 17 years. The graph is derived from an empirical time-series investigation study conducted by Ronald B. Davies of UCD School of Economics. [7] The study typifies these concerns: economic globalization has a net negative impact on labor practices and econometric spatial lag between the labor-rights index and actual labor practices. Lower labor standards allows unethical labor and wage abuse to employees, which could potentially apply to every working individual. This is a huge problem in regards to generating a net benefit. The Economist summarizes the findings as such: “If the labour standards across all other countries decline, those of the excepted country also tend to fall.” [9] These demonstrate the negative effects of economic globalization, and affirm the “race-to-the-bottom” theory.Moreover, the same conclusion can be applied to regulations in environmental protection, indicating due to increased competition, regulations would be lowered to lure polluting businesses to contribute to their GDP. These large companies would settle in areas with the least environmental prevention to their company. The same study from Harvard [6] explains, “by limiting trade and investment in some way, we might be able to attain a better environment for any given level of GDP.” This would negatively affect the environment as these companies would be permitted to release vast amounts of emissions known to contribute to global warming and general degradation of the environment. But beyond environmental attributes, labor practices and the facilitation of income inequality. Osvaldo Sunkel, professor of economics in Chile explains, “Since the [19]80s, when the new [globalization] policies have been implemented more or less all over the world, income distribution has worsened, both within countries and among countries.” [8] Income distribution is being degraded by economic globalization since the 1980s, and no evidence seem to suggest that trend will skew in favor of economic globalization. Indeed, Marc Bacchetta, economics research and statistics division of the World Trade Organization, furthers that globalization results in an “economy [that] is characterized by less job security, lower incomes, an absence of access to a range of social benefits and fewer possibilities to participate in formal education and training programmes – in short, the absence of key ingredients of decent work opportunities.” [10] Opportunities for “most” individuals to obtain “good” jobs are lacking, labor standards are degrading, and income inequality is rampant; all of these necessitate refraining from economic globalization.Conclusion:Due to large concerns in regards to the environment and the implications on labor, economic globalization does not generate a net benefit and certainly is not appealing or desirable. </t>

    <t>1. Now if we do not accept economic globalization, it will only isolate our nation and limit out options. We have been doing economic globalization for years sense we invest money over seas and even have people that work for us companies over seas. To stop now would make it so we lose a lot of money.  2. Due to economic globalization nation's economies increase, and more money flows into these nations. A lot of these nations need that money to try to being moderation programs in these nations. Some such nations that have benefited from it in such a way is china. After china opened it doors for economic trading china's economy greatly increased and the nation started to become more modern because of it. Another nation that is also benefiting economically from globalization is India. India's economy had a strong growth rate until the global recession in 2008. But it is continuing to recover from  3. Due to trade deals witch is a result of economic globalization nations now have access to food they other wise wouldn't have. For example you can now go to a market place and buy banana's from nations all the way in Africa. They helps both nations, because now that nation that sold the bananas will have more money going into there economy. The nation that bought them can now sell them to the people in that nation.  4. Also due to economic globalization companies are starting to open stores in third world nations that originally did not have them. This is a great thing for these nations, for these companies need people to fill in new jobs. So there are more workers now in the workplace, witch means more money is now going back into the economy. This will help the people there, and help aging bring the government closer to being a first world nation. These new jobs will help create a whole new marketplace in some cases and there business will boom. Here is a great example of this, aging I will use India. Due to globalization more IT, and technological jobs are opening up in India. This causes more to be in the work force, and aging benefit the nation by more money going into it.

    <t>Rebuttals1. Isolation if we don't accept globalizationThis point is objectively false for a number of reasons:1. First of all, this is the black or white (false dilemma) fallacy. My opponent falsely asserts there is only two options: isolation, or accepting economic globalization. However, this is quite false, as there are other options, similar to the one for which I advocate.2. Per the definition, which my opponent did not attest or challenge (and thereby accepts), economic globalization is 'The trans-national increase in trade and capital transfers across national boundaries.' [1] Increase, as denoted, is the key word here. Not accepting economic globalization doesn't prohibit trade, it just doesn't advocate for the rampant increase. 3. Thusly, a country isn't by default isolated by nonacceptance of globalization. The claim that the countries would be much poorer is unfounded.2. More money flowHere's a few responses:1. While money can flow in an easy manner, that doesn't necessitate countries being richer. In fact, I've shown how labor implications render this point false.2. My evidence points to the fact that income distribution has worsened. Job opportunities have failed because of this (my evidence also supports this) and subsequent poverty is not solved.3. In the end the flow of money =/= to a richer population, as the money can become transparent for the common people.3. Economic globalization and bananasA couple of responses here, as well:1. Trading, again, doesn't require economic globalization. Before the term was even implicit of an increase in trading, trading existed.2. The rampant increase, as economic globalization would advocate, actually detriments the environment, as I've demonstrated. This would logically destroy the environment in which bananas grow. How can we justifiably advocate for something that would harm banana trade? The argument here is turned: environmental impact of globalization destroys the banana assertion.4. OutsourcingI have some responses of clarification and argumentation:1. What my opponent is claiming here is not just globalization, it's outsourcing. Yet, this doesn't justify globalization for a few reasons as I'll mention.2. Outsourcing is harmful. While it is acclaimed to be good for individual business, it has unintended consequences, a few of which include the following: '[it] leads to fragmentation and disintegration of the supply chain, inviting new competitors into the industry. It also nurtures corporate complacency; and it undermines a company’s relations with its labor, customers, and the domestic and local communities.' [2] These harms can lead it to being a bad business strategy as well as bad for the individual.3. Outsourcing lowers quality. CBS News notes 'Many firms that provide outsourcing quickly cut the quality of component parts in order to increase their margins.' [3] Desperation leads companies to cut down on quality to make more cash for their business itself.4. Outsourcing in regards to progress. Global research finds 'Beginning in 2002 the US began running trade deficits in advanced technology products with Asia, Mexico and Ireland. As these countries are not leaders in advanced technology, the deficits obviously stem from US offshore manufacturing. In effect, the US is giving away its technology, which is rapidly being captured, while US firms reduce themselves to a brand name with a sales force.' [4] Instead of helping the outsourcing nation, it erodes their dominance. Moreover, labor standards and practices in these outsourced companies is despicable. [5] It's not progress for poverty alleviation and human rights activism when a consequence of globalization degrades labor practices as well as the labor laws themselves.Conclusion:Environmental concerns coupled with labor concerns should be sufficient to negating the resolution. However, accompanied by falsehood's that lie in the affirmative (economic impact isn't there), there is no option but to negate.</t>

    <t>I look forward to this debate.  First, I'd like to refer to the statement made by Phil Jones. This is not what he stated. His analysis is often misused to debunk climate change. The meaning of no statistically significant warning between 1995 and 2006 is not disclaiming weather warming. He's discussing the ability to detect a warming trend over a short period of time. Measuring climate over a short term has many variables; noisy factors. Hence, the resulting measurements do not have statistical significance. But extending measurements over a long term does have significance.  --'Over 31,000 scientists have signed on to a petition saying humans aren't causing global warming including 9,029 with a PHD''  I believe this is in reference to the Global Warning Petition Project. This endeavor has been deemed propaganda. Its originators were backed by Exxon. Need I say more?  Yes, recent measurements of the ice caps do indicate an increase.

Also, the results are again based on a short period of time; a single year.

    <t>Through analysis of ice cores, data has shown that prior to 1950, for 650,000 years, carbon dioxide levels have been below 300 parts per million. Since 1950 this level has sharply climbed to 400 parts per million. These numbers take into account solar cycles and earth's rotational variations over time. Also, since 1880 the global surface temperatures have continued to rise. Ninety six cubic miles of ice sheets have been lost just between 2002 and 2005 alone.  Surface temperature increases and ice melts have also significantly affected the oceans. Cold water sinks from the arctic regions and circulates toward the equator where it rises and warms to return back to where it came pushed by winds and currents. This is what keeps the earth's temperature rather temperate (within a specific range) in comparison to other planets. As temperatures rise and water warms this cycle slows, creating greater weather pattern fluctuations. Oceanic animals have become stressed due to the warming of habitat and desalination due to excess fresh water infusion. This is especially prevalent in coastal regions.  Together with the CO2 emissions due to fossil fuel use, additional methane is being released from melting permafrost in the arctic regions. As the permafrost melts methane produced from decaying organic matter increases, adding additional greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</t>

This is very false.  But leaving aside the catastrophic/'change dramatically for the worse' assertion which is not supported by any scientific agreement.  The most common source of this 97% number is in Cook et al. (2013) which leaves out the 'catastrophic' part. In Cook's summary of his paper: 'Cook et al.

Of papers they surveyed. Not climate scientists.  However, if we were to say '97 percent of papers by climate scientists endorsed the view that the Earth is warming up and human emissions of greenhouse gases are the main cause' this too would also false.  This is not a debate on if global warming exists or doesn't exist. This is not a debate on if global warming is harmful to humans.  This is a debate on the 'Man Made' with the 97% claim. If it is not man made then it's usage is meaningless, and the claim should not be used. If there is not a 97% consensus, the the claim should not be used.

Legates, Willie Soon, William M. Briggs, Christopher Monckton of BrenchleyAbstract: Agnotology is the study of how ignorance arises via circulation of misinformation calculated to mislead. Legates et al. (Sci Educ 22:2007–2017, 2013) had questioned the applicability of agnotology to politically-charged debates. In their reply, Bedford and Cook (Sci Educ 22:2019–2030, 2013), seeking to apply agnotology to climate science, asserted that fossil-fuel interests had promoted doubt about a climate consensus. Their definition of climate 'misinformation' was contingent upon the post-modernist assumptions that scientific truth is discernible by measuring a consensus among experts, and that a near unanimous consensus exists. However, inspection of a claim by Cook et al. (Environ Res Lett 8:024024, 2013) of 97.1 % consensus, heavily relied upon by Bedford and Cook, shows just 0.3 % endorsement of the standard definition of consensus: that most warming since 1950 is anthropogenic. Agnotology, then, is a two-edged sword since either side in a debate may claim that general ignorance arises from misinformation allegedly circulated by the other. Significant questions about anthropogenic influences on climate remain. Therefore, Legates et al. appropriately asserted that partisan presentations of controversies stifle debate and have no place in education.Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the literature: A re-analysis(PDF) [Archive](Energy Policy, Volume 73, pp. 701-705, October 2014)- Richard S. J. TolAbstract: A claim has been that 97% of the scientific literature endorses anthropogenic climate change (Cook et al., 2013. Environ. Res. Lett. 8, 024024). This claim, frequently repeated in debates about climate policy, does not stand. A trend in composition is mistaken for a trend in endorsement. Reported results are inconsistent and biased. The sample is not representative and contains many irrelevant papers. Overall, data quality is low. Cook's validation test shows that the data are invalid. Data disclosure is incomplete so that key results cannot be reproduced or tested.Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the literature: Rejoinder(PDF) [Archive](Energy Policy, Volume 73, pp. 709, October 2014)- Richard S.

They do not dispute(1) that their sample is not representative,(2) that data quality is low,(3) that their validation test is not passed,(4) that they mistake a trend in composition for a trend in endorsement,(5) that the majority of the investigated papers that take a position on (anthropogenic) climate change in fact do not examine any evidence, and(6) that there are inexplicable patterns in the data.Comment on 'Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature' (PDF) [Archive](Environmental Research Letters, Volume 10, Number 3, March 2015)- Benjamin John Floyd DeanAbstract: I read the study by Cook et al with great interest [1]. The study used levels of endorsement of global warming as outlined in their table 2; however, I could see no mention as to how these levels were created and how reliable they were in terms of both inter-rater and intra-rater reliability (Cohen's kappa). Best practice on rater reliability indicates that both inter-rater and intra-rater should have been measured and documented in a study such as Dr Cook's [2] and I am surprised that this fact appears to have been neglected.

    <t>Kind regards, no, I don't forfeit rounds, I'm just a little busy at the moment due to University. Final Round:First of all I would like to address my previous statement regarding the FAO report. While it most certainly provides evidence, it also is contradicted by many different sources. However, if my statement is read again, it clearly states that 'they', and not it, is to be trusted, meaning the other reports or apparent evidence used by 'Cowspiracy'. As for Pro's statement that 'Again you assert wri.org is more trust worthy without proving it. Basically Con is stating that the World resource institute WRI is more reputable than the FAO Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.', no, that is not what I am saying. Also, if you want to play the 'prove game', prove that your sources are trustworthy. That will bring us nowhere. The point to be addressed is that the FAO report, while the full report is seemingly not accessible, parts of it are, includes many sources of data potentially unrelated to to factory farming, such as deforestation and cropping. 'Meat industry sources object to the methodology used in the UN report, notably that deforestation for livestock was included in the calculations. These sources point out that pasture-grass-feeding, such as is common in New Zealand, may lead to lower emissions attributable to livestock, despite the fact that methane and nitrous oxide from livestock make up half of New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions.' As well as above, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (quoted from Wikipedia) found 'In 2006, emissions sources contained within the Agricultural Chapters were responsible for emissions of … 6 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.' (currently being around 9%, as stated in round one, but unchallenged by Pro). This, as stated in round one, is evidence for the U.S., a country with, as stated in the previous round, 99% animals being raised under 'factory farming' setting. This would mean that the U.S. could be taken as an example, meaning that, as in the U.S.'s case, factory farming being 99% of farming, yet only producing 9% of Greenhouse gases, which, by the way, is less than the U.S.'s transport emission, that factory farming by no means is the number one cause of man made global climate change. Besides, I would like to point to round one, where factory farming was clearly defined, with no objection of Pro, as 'a system of rearing livestock using highly intensive methods, by which poultry, pigs, or cattle are confined indoors under strictly controlled conditions.'. This means that all of Pro's attempt to define all farming as 'factory farming' are non applicable. Otherwise we could define cattle, such as raised in Australia or huge parts of South America, which by all means can go wherever they want to on properties which are thousands of square kilometres large, as factory farming, because they are still under human control when mustered or 'belong' to humans.. Absolute nonsense. Factory farming is, as stated in round one already, animals being raised indoors, normally in small pens, in an attempt to decrease labour input and maximise output. Also, according to Pro, as the burning of the Amazon rainforest apparently should be counted as 'factory farming', practices such as slash and burn clearing of land for plantations are apparently factory farming as well. It is also to note that Pro has not submitted any facts supporting their thesis that 'factory farming' is the number one cause of man-made global climate change, other than the 18% number, that farming, as factory farming has not even been implicated, other than in the weak reasoning of an attempt to make all farming practices, seemingly plant production included, into factory farming. Conclusion:While Pro has neither provided a valid definition of 'Factory Farming', nor actually provided any evidence that factory farming actually is the number 1 cause of man made global climate change, Con has provided evidence against this. 'The most important factor in this debate is that Pro did not provide a link between the only evidence between the only applicable source used, the FAO report of 2006, which states that livestock creates 18% of Greenhouse gasses, however, Pro does not provide what amount of these 18% is actually 'Factory Farmed'. This means, that possibly the number of Greenhouse gases produced by non factory farmed animals, remembering that factory farming, as stated in round 2, makes up around 40% of livestock numbers. Using logical reasoning, this would mean that non factory farmed animals produce more Greenhouse gases than factory farmed ones by sheer number, also taking into consideration that in a free range farming environment more resources become wasted when compared to factory farming, possibly creating more emissions. Furthermore it needs to be considered that according to many other sources, as supplied by Con, agriculture does, potentially, make up 18% of emissions as the FAO report includes some controversial factors. Pro's inclusion of the Amazon rainforest example cannot be seen as evidence, as in no way does the Greenpeace source provided, as bias as it is, provide a link to 'factory farming'. In fact, all the images Greenpeace has provided display animals freely roaming smoke filled ground resulting in slash and burn, hardly being factory farming, other than some images of animals being drafted, which, once again, is a result of the opposite of factory farming. Factory Farmed animals do not have to be drafted and mustered. The source Pro provided about 51% of emissions created by livestock was already rebutted in round 2 and the comments, as the authors of the source are incapable of conducting simple mathematical calculations. Thus, finally, as Pro has not provided any convincing evidence, or in fact any evidence at all, that factory farming is the number one source of man made global climate change, I, Con, will have to remain with my conclusion posted in round one, that Factory Farming is not the number one cause of man made global climate change.

    <t>Kind Regards for you arguments. Also, I always back up my argument, otherwise it would be opinion and not a proper argument.Rebuttals and arguments:First and foremost I would like to refer to what I wrote in the comments, previous to Pro posting their statement. This was that the sources of 'Cowspiracy', mainly the FAO report, as well as basically all sources of the 'report', cannot be trusted as they are, in no way, academic or trustworthy. As such I will simply quote myself, as to what I said in the comments:'I have studied agriculture, I know what effect agriculture has on the environment very well. However, the majority of agricultural problems arising are not simply from 'factory farming'. (And with that I mean environmental, not solely emission wise)But as for their sources. I will analyse their sources on Greenhouse gases from top to bottom:1.) I cannot access this source. Having read up on it, it is also stated as bias.2.) Same again3.) Not scientific. Also, the authors can't calculate, discrediting them even more. According to them, 7516 million metric tons of CO2e are produced by agriculture (animals) per year, being 11.8% (while previously stating 18%) of the worlds total. They then calculate this up to 32000 million, saying that it is 50%. That would be correct if it was 11.8%, making 100% around 64000 million, however, the world total is 42/46000 million tons CO2e. That means 32000 million is in no way 50%... 18% makes a number around that 100%, meaning the authors can't even do simple maths..4.) The rest is quite unrelated to the topic.'Furthermore it is to note that Pro has not made a clear link between 'Factory Farming' and climate change, but only between Farming and Climate change. However, 'factory farming' makes up under 50% (around 40%) of animal related agriculture, and evidence suggests that non factory farmed animals produce more emission than 'factory farmed' animals, meaning that even they would have a higher emission than 'factory farming'. It is furthermore to state that the graph provided in round 1 is for the U.S, and it is to mention that the U.S. has one of the highest 'factory farming' sectors, with around 99% of agricultural animals held in the U.S. being held in 'factory farming' setting. This would mean that, looking at above graph, factory farming most definitely is not the primary cause of man made global climate change. Pro's sources regarding greenpeace and the amazon rainforest can be disregarded, as they are not linked to factory farming. Conclusion:This means that none of Pro's sources can be seen as evidence that Factory Farming is the number one cause of man made global climate change.

    <t>Kind regards for this debate. I will be representing the Con side, meaning that I will be debating that Factory Farming is not the number 1 cause of man made climate change. First I would like to define 'factory farming', being defined as 'a system of rearing livestock using highly intensive methods, by which poultry, pigs, or cattle are confined indoors under strictly controlled conditions.''Man made' implies that 'made or caused by human beings (as opposed to occurring or being made naturally).' This means that the burning of fossil fuels, while it could occur naturally, occurs 'man made' as the method by which fossil fuels are creating climate change and are by all means man made, as to say that a majority of emissions would not occur, was it not for the human action of burning fossil fuels, thus implying a man made action and resulting in man made climate change.Opening Statement:First I would like to refer to to the World Resources Institute's data showing that the US is one of the highest contributors to emissions. That being said, I will provide the following graph easily showing the little impact farming, not to mention this includes all practices of farming, not just 'factory farming', has on the overall emissions. This graph is provided by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Easy to see, Agriculture has a minimal input of 9% on Greenhouse Gas emissions. Furthermore it is to mention, that according to the source used above, methane, the gas produced by animals, may make up an estimated 30% of emmissions in the Agricultural sector, however, thus only around 3% overall. And this is not even factory farming, just animals in total. Conclusion:As provided by statistics above, Agriculture itself is not even a major contribution to Greenhouse gas emissions, meaning that factory farming, which is an even smaller contributor, is not the number one cause of man made global climate change.

    <t>Look at figure 5 in source 1. It clearly shows a massive spike in temperature right after the Little Ice Age. It would be easy to dismiss - except that, if you look closely, you see the temperature trending slightly DOWNWARDS before the Industrial Revolution started. Would we live in a much colder present without the Industrial Revolution's negative climatic effects? It's hard to deny the data, and it's even more of a stretch to say that there's no correlation with the IR.  As you said, carbon levels are rising. You attribute this to volcanoes. Yet volcanoes only produce about 1% of the carbon produced by fossil fuel burning (2). Even if the rate of volcanic eruptions quintupled, this would still not explain the dramatic rise in atmospheric carbon. You also state that climate change is part of some 'natural cycle.' Yet contrary to your beliefs (and, I'll admit, some of my idle thoughts, until I read this article), climate change is definitely not part of the same cycle as the Ice Ages (3). For one thing, it's not happening during the correct alignment of Earth's axis; while we're definitely in a warm period, the temperature should be FALLING, not rising, since the peak of the warm period was a few thousand years ago. Even if climate change WAS caused by the Sun, the troposphere is getting warmer while the stratosphere and -spheres above cool, a fingerprint of greenhouse gas warming. The Sun would be heating all layers equally. That leaves volcanic and oceanic greenhouse gas releases as the only possible candidates - yet they are both tiny climate change contributors, as I explained earlier, and - get this - they actually release a different carbon isotope mix with a different molecular makeup. The oceanic and volcanic carbon has a lower ratio of carbon-12 to carbon-13 - so how do you explain that the ratio has been rising steadily?  Lastly, you cited the Medieval Warm Period as evidence that the Earth goes through natural cycles of warming and cooling. Look at the map of the MWP warming pattern in source 4, and compare it to the map of today's manmade climate change. They look - ahem - a little bit different. The only part of the Earth that really saw significant warming during the MWP was Viking territory, and a larger part of the Earth actually got cooler. The lower map, of today's carbon, is like a goldfish that's been beaten to death - red with purple spots - and shows a much more uniform warming pattern.  Please explain.</t>

    <t>You seem to be misunderstanding the question. Neither the question nor I ever said humans were 'THE cause' of climate change, but they are far and away the most destructive and sudden cause. Look at Graph 1. If, as you said, humans had no effect on climate change, how do you explain that extreme anomaly? While it certainly began at the peak of an Ice Age temperature/carbon cycle, the real production did not start until much later, and, as the graph shows, half the rise has been produced SINCE 1950. You ask me to explain how the climate spiked in the past - the answer is that it was a natural cycle, as you said. I NEVER claimed that all historical climate change was caused by humans. But this is an anomaly. Look at Source 2: Climate change now is 50 to 100 times faster than at any point in the past 65 million years. The biggest mistake climate skeptics make is to say that man-made climate change goes at anything like the pace of natural climate change: It does not. It's faster, so muchly-much faster that it's unattributable to volcanoes and oceans. Skeptics tend to say that atmospheric temperature can't rise as fast as scientists say it can, since the atmosphere is big, but it can. My point is that this is a different kind of cycle, far beyond anything since the dinosaurs went extinct.  I already explained how this cycle is different, actually. Look at my Source 4. Warming is more balanced in natural cycles. During the Ice Ages, Africa was heating up while Europe was being covered in ice. The planet can regulate its own temperature, but not in extreme circumstances, which we've now created. So the entire Earth is warming. Nothing has gotten colder, except once every twelve months when all the deniers come out of their houses and say their opinion is valid because there's snow on the ground. This change is fundamentally different from all before it. For the sake of our children and grandchildren, we need to act now.  </t>

Climate: the average course or condition of the weather at a place usually over a period of years as exhibited by temperature, wind velocity, and precipitationHumans do indeed play a role in climate change, but they do not explicitly 'cause' climate change. Between the years of 900 and 1250, parts of the earth experienced a wide spread warming (Medieval Warm Period). This was before the existence of the Industrial Revolution, the invention of cars, and the widespread use of fossil fuels. Following this warm period, there was a cooling period. Millions of years ago, before humans roamed around, earth's climate had a drastic change. Carbon levels rose, and the earth heated up. A good number of organisms died. It's interesting to note that in both of these cases, humans were either completely absent or in a much lesser number than now. And yet, somehow, the earth was still warming up. Yes, carbon levels are rising. Yes, the earth has warmed up a bit within the past 50 years. Yes, the sea levels have risen. But can we really blame humans and human activity? Climate change does happen, but to say that it is 'caused' by human activity is quite a stretch.Even though the steady rise in carbon levels and sea levels can be loosely matched with the Industrial Revolution and the rise of humans, this is in no way definitive proof that humans cause climate change. Science has shown us many examples of climate change that did not directly involve humans.It's also important to understand that volcanoes have much to do with carbon levels and climate change.

Volcanoes and oceanic emissions make up a very small percentage when it comes to carbon emission, but the numbers are still there.How did the volcanic CO2 emissions measure up 300 years ago? 200 years ago? 100 years ago? Climate change has been a very long and drawn out event. It is not an overnight change. Volcano eruptions in the past did outweigh the emissions made by humans. Humans began producing and thriving at a much greater level, and now, human emissions outweigh volcanic eruptions. So how can we attest climate change to humans when hundreds of years ago (when the climate was still rising) volcanic activity outweighed human emissions? If humans cause climate change, please explain why the climate spiked in the past, even when humans were hardly making a significant impact on CO2 levels in the atmosphere.</t>
<h>    While your arguments are certainly convincing, they still in no way prove that humans are the direct cause of climate change.</h>

    <t>The spikes in temperature are not that much of an anomly when compared to climates in the past. And the entire earth is not warming. According to NASA, the ice in Antarctica is really building up, and there's actually more ice there than before. Now why would that happen if the 'entire earth' was warming up? It seems to me that the Earth is regulating itself. At one end of the globe, things are heating up, but in the Antarctic, things are getting even cooler. I see where you are coming from, however I have to respectfully disagree. It's also interesting to note that whenever the earth gets warmer, scientists immediately jump to climate change and global warming. When the earth gets cooler, somehow, it's still considered to be global warming.</t>

    <t>Humans do cause climate change. Though natural amounts of carbon in the atmosphere vary from 180 to 300ppm, today the level is at 400ppm - higher than in the past 800,000 years. Would the opposition suggest that this is a fluke? In addition, the sea level has risen around 220 mm in just 135 years, neatly coinciding with the Industrial Revolution and the corresponding increase in greenhouse gases . These two pieces of evidence, I believe, are enough to demonstrate that climate change does happen and is caused by human activity.  </t>

    <t>This is a debate about whether or not global warming is real. The premise is that global warming is real, and I am taking the Pro position - that is, I am arguing that global warming is real.  I, as Pro, will have the burden of proof in this debate. Since my opponent will be taking the Con position, it is not up to my opponent to prove that global warming is not real. Rather, it is up to me to prove that it is real. I will have the responsibility of making the arguments. My opponent will not have any responsibility or obligation to make arguments. However, if my opponent chooses to make arguments, that's OK. The only obligation that my opponent has is to debunk my arguments. I can debunk my opponent's arguments if they choose to make any, but my primary goal will to be to make my own arguments. The burden of proof is on me. Also, this is not a debate about whether anthropogenic global warming is real. It's a debate about whether global warming is real. If I prove that global warming is real and that it is primarily or totally anthropogenic, then I will have succeeded. If I prove that it is real but also prove that it is not anthropogenic, then I will have also succeeded. If I prove that it is real but I don't prove what causes it, then I will have also succeeded. Keep this in mind if you accept the debate.  Now, let's define global warming. The definition that my opponent and I will use in this debate is 'the overall increase of the average temperature of the planet Earth', not 'the Earth getting warmer all the time, everywhere'.  I welcome anyone to accept this debate.</t>

But remember, this is not a debate about whether global warming is 'doomsday'. In the very first round of this debate, I clearly said, 'The definition that my opponent and I will use in this debate is 'the overall increase of the average temperature of the planet Earth', not 'the Earth getting warmer all the time, everywhere'.' That's all that this debate is supposed to be about. I have already proven global warming by that definition, and my opponent has even acknowledged that global warming is real in some form. Whether global warming is 'doomsday' is completely irrelevant to this debate. My opponent also says, 'The world is warming slighty [sic]. That's a fact. Anything else you'd like to attribute to global warming is speculation. That makes your perceptions about it unreal and it's why you'd like to frame the debate the way you have.' But I'm not attributing anything else to global warming in this debate, so I'm not making any speculations in this debate. I'm merely giving arguments to support the fact that global warming exists. I'm not arguing for anything else in this debate. The premise of this debate is that global warming is real, and I have already included a definition for global warming. I have proven the premise, if we use the definition of global warming that I gave in the first round.  I wish my opponent luck in this final round.

Please note that I am not arguing about whether global warming will rapidly increase in the future. I am only arguing about whether it exists today. Now, let's go back to data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs_v3/, which I referenced earlier. If you look at the graph that says 'Global Temperature (meteorological stations)', you can clearly see that the graph has a positive trend. It may not be increasing very rapidly, but remember that I am not arguing that global warming is increasing rapidly. I am merely arguing that it exists. My opponent also says, 'We don't need to close perfectly good coal plants, lay off thousands of people, starve Africa of electric power or pay drastically higher energy bills.' I am not arguing for any of those things. This is not a debate about possible solutions for global warming, but rather a debate about whether global warming exists. My opponent finally says, 'The 'real' part of global warming is that it's not that big of a deal.' Again, I'm not arguing that it's a major catastrophe or a big deal. I'm just arguing that it's real, which my opponent has even acknowledged.  I welcome my opponent to respond to my arguments.</t>

If my opponent is acknowledging that global warming is real, which they seem to be doing, then it would appear that they are arguing for my side. Even if global warming is much slower than the models predicted and doesn't have consequences that are as bad as some people say, then that does nothing to advance my opponent's argument. Remember, this debate is solely about whether global warming is real - not about whether it will have terrible consequences or about how slow or fast it is.  And now, to make my own argument. Global warming is a fact. The global mean land-ocean temperature is much higher than it was in 1880, and overall, the trend has been that it has been increasing since then. It does decrease at times, which is inevitable. Temperatures rise and fall. But overall, the trend is that the global mean land-ocean temperature is increasing. The same can be said for the global temperature. Both of these can be verified by going to data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs_v3/.  I welcome my opponent to respond to my arguments.</t>

    <t>I will enumerate more of my opponents graphs.Figure 12: Global Glacier Cumulative Volume ChangesFigure 13: Proportions of growing and shrinking glaciers in 2009Figure 14: Sea Levels since 1870Figure 15: US Stations reporting continuously from 1900 to 2000Figure 16: Feedbacks vs Forcings GraphPart 6: Contradictory Glacial, Sea Level, and Temperature DataFigure 12 is interesting not because it counters any of my argument, but because it puts my opponents temperature, and sea level data in contradiction with it. If you look at 1970 in Figure 12 You'll notice the volume of glacial ice is higher than any point from 1870 to 1970. How did we get more Ice in 1970? If we accept that the melt of glaciers is caused solely by heat, and if we accept ether Figure 2, or the corrected Figure 6 then we have a problem. The dates leading up to 1970 don't show any noticeable decline in temperature that would explain it, and the Figure 14 sea levels don't show any stabilizing or drop in sea level to address where this extra water for the ice even came from.We're locked into another contradiction similar to the one that I started with. Ether the Glacial data is correct, and temperature, and sea level is incorrect. The Inverse of that, or both are wrong.There are a couple of issues with Figure 12 that will need to be disclosed and accounted for before we can con to a decision about which data is correct. According to my opponent's source the number of glaciers represented from 1946 on back is in the single digits. It's not until about 1960 that we have about 30 glaciers represented in the sample. If we take a look at Figure 10 we can see that this is the point where the yearly median drops below zero implying slightly colder than average temperatures.If you look at Figure 12 at 1980 you'll notice the angle of decrease shows a slowing which would imply that the temperature decreased, or had a slower accent than in prior years. In Figures 2, and 6 no such indication is given, but in Figure 10 the early 80's shows another decline in temperatures before the 90's where it finally moves above zero implying higher than normal temperatures, and thus a steeper decline in volume.In other words Figure 12 is in less contradiction with Figure 11 then it is with Figures 2, 6, and 14.However, Figure 12 also suffers from exaggeration of features due to changing sample size. This is address in my analysis in step 4, and when I brought up the causes of the differences between Figure 7 and Figure 8. Adding in a thousand weather stations radically altered the graph which is why step 4 restricted weather stations to existing at the start and end of the analysis. So where does the sampling look like for Glaciers? My opponent's source is very nice to graph it out for us to see on their intermediate discussion of glacial ice.Figure 17: Number of observed glaciersAs you can see just prior to 1976 there was only about 45 glaciers in the data. Then it spontaneously has about 20, nearly half of the prior sample, added in. This continues until the early 80's where that with a sample of just over 90 has doubled the sample. Then throw out the 90's regular sampling increased, and this would further exaggerate the changes because we hasn't sampled the glaciers in that method in the past.Now I'd love to download the generate the data properly myself. My opponents source does point people towards it here: wgms.ch/data_databaseversions/ However the data isn't high quality like the GHCN dataset, and would require more time than I have in this debate to properly process. It also doesn't have what I would consider a high enough quantity of data. It barely has 30 glaciers sampled regularly, and I'd personally prefer 100 before I started making definitive claims about what the data says. Even the source claims that they have 228 glaciers in the data, and the only way for that to work with the sample graph is if glaciers skip years, and aren't fully represented every year, and across every season in a year.Part 7: Hiatus Proof?My opponent is under the mistaken belief that I've proven the hiatus to be false. Unfortunately Part 1 of my argument does everything, but that. I've proven only that two parts of the global warming argument about the hiatus are in stark contradiction with each other. That only proves one, or both are wrong. Unfortunately it doesn't prove which one is actually wrong. Parts 2, 3, and 4 are the evidence that undermines Figures 2, and 6 strongly suggesting that data in both cases is flawed. It's up you the judges to choose which you believe. However, using my opponent's reasoning that “because more recent updates are and should be seen as more trustworthy” is counter to logic, reason, and debate. It is an appeal to the authority of newness, and not a rational reason at all.Part 8: Correlation vs CausationMy opponent seems to be under the impression that my only focuses on the temperatures, and doesn't refute humans as the cause. There is a phrase in statistics that you may have heard. “Correlation does not imply causation”, but that's only half the phrase. These other half is, “There is no causation without correlation”. Simply put if there is no correlation between global warming and human activity as Figure 10 shows then humans are certainly not the cause. However, if you believe Figure 2, or 6, and that they correlate to human CO2 activity then there is the additional burden of proving that the correlation causal, and not just correlational.It's an unfortunate asymmetry in statistical arguments. There is a possibility that even if there isn't a correlation that maybe the correlation is just smaller than can be measured with the available data, but that would yield that human activity is an insignificant factor in global warming.As for correlation issues my opponent has another problem. If we believe Figure 14 we'd expect out CO2 emissions to map over it, and show a visible correlation. Now both CO2, and Ocean levels have gone up over time, but just going up isn't enough. Sea levels have a nice smooth mathematical curve built into it. I'd have loved to have put both the CO2 and Figure 14 together, but my opponents source linking to the data to do that leads to a 404 error. CO2 EmissionsIf you notice between 1950 and 200 there is a bulge in out CO2 emissions, and between 1980 and 2000 a different rate of increase until 2000 where it is in line with an exponential trend that started in 1870. These features would be expected in the Sea Levels data if they were strongly correlated, but it looks like by the seal levels that it's an exponential trend that never varies in the way out CO2 emissions do. My data is courtesy of Source 8. Now if my opponent can find the source for this Figure I'd be happy to merge the sea level in so we can see just how much it doesn't correlate. Most other sources only give about 10 years of data.Part 9: Solar ActivityMy opponent is under the impression that he can wave his hands, and assert an argument, and data is null just because it doesn't conform to his world view. He'd have to explain the lack of movement in the past data, and give an appropriate alternative for Cycle 24 correlating, but not prior. NASA's assessment in 2008 on the effect of Solar Storms due to this unprecedented phenomenon had no prior data. Outside of the last decade this was never observed before. Claiming that we should see all layers heat up as he claims to try to ‘nullify' is nothing more than an unsupported assumption.Part 10: Dust BowlMy opponent makes the claim that I hadn't explained the downward change in the median, and then attempted to assert that it must be from a change in methodology. Though I'm not against this possibility claiming that a change in any of the graphs is due to a methodology change requires further explanation. Parts 2, 3, and 4 are extensive explanation of methodological errors. However, I did explain the change in the graph even if it was indirect. In the 1930's there was a excessive drought, and heat waves. Part of this being clearly represented in the data is due to the United States having the best most consistent weather station data for the last century, and even more so in my opponent's Figure 15 because it is only the United States of America 600 weather stations vs my sample of 1170 weather stations. Now this event very much did occur, and is verified in the EPA Heat Wave Index that shows the 30's were exceedingly bad even by today's standards, and you can read source 5 to see further analysis on this Great Depression causing event if you doubt the 30's heat waves weren't hell on Earth.Now why the 30's was Hell on Earth is anybody's guess. We know it was bad, and man made CO2 emissions were even lower so blaming them enters into contradiction with the present high emissions. Personally I'd love it if there was enough pan evaporation data to verify that there was, or was not a correlation with sunspots, but the available GHCN data is too small for that period evaporation data.Part 11: Contention 4My opponents 4th contention appears to be missing an actual argument to go with it, or even a time period to show the change in forcing, and feedbacks over time. Perhaps he will clarify in the next round what he was going after with it.Part 12: Earth, Mars, and VenusI'm out of time, and characters so I will have to cut my response a bit, and hope to come back to this part if possible.I await my opponent.</t>
<h> Contradictory Glacial, Sea Level, and Temperature Data is interesting not because it counters any of my argument, but because it puts my opponents temperature, and sea level data in contradiction with it.</h>

    <t>Resolved: Human Activity Is a Significant Factor in Global Warming on Planet Earth.I don't intend on reposting any of my opponents graphs, or data. However it is important that I enumerate his graphs.Figure 1: Atmospheric CO2 for 650,000 yearsFigure 2: Global Land-Ocean Temperature IndexFigure 3: Greenhouse ExplanationFigure 4: Average Monthly Arctic Sea Ice August 1979 to 2013Figure 5: Sea Level ChangePart 1: DoubtIt's telling that my opponent makes the claim that it is irrefutable, and then uses Figure 2. Even NASA, and NOAA would refute that graph since in June of this year they published serious corrections in an attempt to remove the hiatus from the argument.Figure 6: Corrected Figure 2Now this claim that the pause doesn't exist poses a problem because a few years ago the claim was that the pause was caused by about 17 volcanoes back as little as 2014[2]. So which is it? Does the pause exist, and was caused by Volcanoes, or does the pause not exist, and was caused by weighting issues in the data? Any reasonable person should now have some doubt in the basic data claims of global warming for a basic contradiction.Part 2: Methodology BiasUnderstanding instrument, and methodology bias is needed to understand what was done in Figure 6, and understand if we should accept the graph at all.The data that is being corrected is the Ocean temperature measurements done by volunteer ships in the early half of the data. By itself this isn't a problem. The ship data has a higher inaccuracy, but all the ship data would have similar errors, and when compared to the same methodology there wouldn't be an issue. When you mix in other methodologies this error can become a big problem. What caused these differences isn't hard to understand. Think of a time where we collected temperature data without the aid of a machine. If someone has to go out, and check the temperature, and record it there is always the possibility they missed the true high, and missed the true low. When we get to machine aided recording missing that true high, and true low is drastically reduced. Furthermore the error is unidirectional. Missing the true high will only result in a lower value. Just as missing the true low only results in a higher value.We can actually see this type of bias in weather station dataset call the GHCN Data: [3]If we didn't accept the methodology bias Figure 7 would present an interesting problem since the average high increase about 4 degrees C, and the average Low decreases by about 6 degrees C. If that was global warming the decrease in the low would seriously outweigh the increase in the high.Figure 7: All GHCN High and Low Temperature Yearly AveragesPart 3: Addressing BiasTo address bias the bias must remain as constant as possible. Part of the reason for only debating the last 115 years is that the bias for weather station methodology hasn't radically changed unlike in the seventeen, and eighteen hundreds where changes in methodology were much more common. By just comparing a station to itself, and only looking at the stations delta from hits own average we can show that the abrupt change around 1900 was actually an illusion caused by a large number of stations following a similar methodology, and not an actual change in temperature.We can see in Figure 8 that the change is more gradual like the low temperature in Figure 7. The disagreement between the two graphs implies that the change is due to method changes, and not due to real changes.Figure 8: All GHCN Station High Temperature Average DeltaFigure 9: All GHCN Station Low Temperature Average DeltaIt would be an error to accept either Figure 7 or 8 as the truth. Both still suffer from a change in methodology bias, but they reflect that change differently. They both also high the noise in the data by utilizing a yearly, and 5 year mean. However, if you do accept Figure 7 as the truth you'd still have to reconcile the issue that Figure 9 shows that the Low temperature being higher than our modern time.We also have an issue with sample size. At the earliest part of the data there is only 1 station. It's not until the 1870's that we start to get a decent sample size to start to remove statistical sampling errors, but even then it's only at a minimum. At the peak of the data in 2005 we have nearly 14 thousand station, but by 2015 we only have 10 thousand stations. This radical change in sample size can cause. Just as in 1893 we only had 563 stations but in 1894 we had 1353 which is responsible for the abrupt change in Figure 7.The methodology below is what I will use to address each of these issues.Methodology GHCN Data Analysis: 1. To process this data the first step is to convert each stations monthly 31 day values into a single monthly median value for each station.2. Then each stations monthly median values are averages to create the average median for the life of the station.3. The station average median is then subtracted from the station median to create a delta that represents that stations change away from the average median.4. Stations are then selected based on the date of operation. For analysis starting in 1900 all weather stations that were operational in 1900 and operational at the end of the analysis must be used. Weather stations that were not operational at the start of the analysis cannot be used because they will induce a change in the region bias.5. From there the data can be graphed, or each months delta for the year can be averaged to create a yearly change for a simpler graph.Part 4: GHCN Data AnalysisFigure 10 below is the above analysis applied to the Global Historical Climatology Network Data. The blue dots represent the monthly noise that Figure 2, and 6 hides. We can now see that the average temperature varies by +- 4 degrees from normal, and not the few tenths of a degree that the yearly mean implies. As a note the two largest positive deviations from the mean are March 2010, and 2012 by 6.1, and 6.6 degrees respectively. They are separated by nearly a century, and show that the high temperatures of 2012 are hardly abnormal.If you notice in the graph between 1930, and 1940 you'll notice a clear bulge in the 5 year mean about zero. This is of note because it correlates with the known heat waves of the 30's that attributed to an climaxed with the Dust Bowl in 1936 as seen in the EPA Heat Wave Index[5]. Anyone looking at this data in the 50's and 60's might actually believe that we were heading towards a global cooling event since in the 70's the median clearly drops below zero. Conversely anyone starting their analysis in the 70's is starting at a low, and thus only see a movement upwards. Which may also explain my opponent's Figures 4 and 5 which start with the low 70's era, and lack any data for the early half of the 115 year period this debate is over.We can even apply a trend line to see if there is a trend upwards over the time period. There is a slight trend of 0.0009 degrees celsius per year, but this is with an R Squared of 0.0004 which means the significance of that upward trend is almost nothing, and can't be used for any real future predictions. For those unfamiliar with R Squared we really want to see a value as close to 1 as possible. A value of 0.5 is ok for some things like predicting erratic human behavior, but the more significant the claim the closer to 1 it needs to be. 0.0004 is so close to zero that it may as well be zero.Figure 10: GHCN High Monthly Average Delta 1900 - 2015I'd present A figure on the Low, but it would be redundant with Figure 10, and given the time and text constraints I will cut it from my argument.Part 5: Is Temperature the Appropriate Measure?When we say that CO2 causes the Earth's temperature to rise what we really mean is that the increase in CO2 causes the atmosphere to hold more energy. The Pan Evaporation Rate can be used to measure the energy in the atmosphere. If you take a look at Figure 11 you'll notice it significantly deviates from a rather consistent trend. I've reduced the time range to 1980 to 2015 to give the largest possible sample of 156 pans in the GHCN dataset.Figure 11: Pan Evaporation to Sun SpotsIf we accept the increase is due to an abnormal warming due to solar storms that track with sun spots then we have a problem from the lack of any significant change during the man made ramp up of CO2 over the last 3, and a half decades. Since the sun's solar output varies by about 0.1 percent[6] it could be that even adding more CO2 has little effect because we've long since been able to absorb nearly all of the available solar energy.So why is there a spontaneous increase after 2005? In 2008 NASA announced a discovery of an odd phenomena. They observed a Northern polarity Coronal Mass Ejection rip open our Northern Magnetic pole, and thus exposed the entire day side of the planet to solar storms that it doesn't normally get[7]. This resulted in the prediction that solar cycle 24 which would send more northern polarity CME's towards the Earth would, and subject us to an unusually high volume of Solar Storms that our Magnetic field usually protects us from. This would also explain why the shape with many of the same peaks and valleys visible in the data.</t>

    <t>Thanks to my opponent, it's been fun.I will respond to the points my opponent has made in this round, and clarify my case.But first of all, I am sure that I hadn't ignored a piece of my opponent's case. Don't trust this claim as just because a response is brief doesn't mean it's not valid.==Rebuttal 1: 1970 has more ice than 1870==My opponent is correct that the data is cumulative. However, he drops my response to this when I stated that there was an apparent but brief drop in temperature caused by sulphate aerosols. I don't agree with how my opponent states I must drop the evidence simply because his basis is that there was an increase in ice for 20 years (even though the line starts dropping rapidly). If we were to apply a trend line the line would most definitely be slanted downwards towards the right. His argument doesn't explain the rest of the graph showing sharp declines in ice. I find that my opponent nitpicks at every little flaw that doesn't seem right even though the rest supports my argument, and he ends up dropping the rest of the graph altogether.I think what my opponent focuses the most on, however, is how figures are exaggerated as more and more climate stations are set up, and he attempts to apply that to temperature record figures. However, the notion that temperature record figures are untrustworthy is false, as has been shown throughout the debate [1]:'For example, a study by Anderson et al. (2012) created a new global surface temperature record reconstruction using 173 records with some type of physical or biological link toglobal surface temperatures (corals, ice cores, speleothems, lake and ocean sediments, and historical documents).  The study compared their reconstruction to the instrumental temperature record and found a strong correlation between the two[.]' - Skeptical Science [1]==Rebuttal 2: No correlation==This point as a large relation with the first point, and doesn't affect much in the debate. Basically my opponent states that we can't trust graphs that start in the 70's because it was a low point in global warming. There are two points to make:(A) Again, my opponent doesn't focus on the rest of the graphs with clearly agree with my case in the debate.(B) The only figures I gave which started in the 70's are the ones I had replaced with other data.Again, this point is null because it has little to no weight in this debate.==Rebuttal 3: Pan Evaporation==My opponent drops my response to this argument, where I gave the two statements that (a) we cannot use the method because no sources or figures measuring temperature correlate with pan evaporation, and (b) global warming is found to be affected by human causes the most, as shown in the last round.After doing some research, I found that pan evaporation did have to do with climate, but not with global warming. This extends the point of my rebuttal [2]:'Pan evaporation is a measurement that combines or integrates the effects of several climate elements: temperature, humidity, rain fall, drought dispersion, solar radiation, and wind. Evaporation is greatest on hot, windy, dry, sunny days; and is greatly reduced when clouds block the sun and when air is cool, calm, and humid. Pan evaporation measurements enable farmers and ranchers to understand how much water their crops will need.' - Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopediia [2]Wikipedia states that pan evaporation helps farmers and ranchers to correctly water their crops. But never does it say anything about energy in the atmosphere.==Counter 1: Sea Levels==My opponent seems to make a valid point about the glaical and ice contradiction, but it isn't valid. Glaciers hold less than 2% of the water on Earth [3]:'The amount of water locked up in ice and snow is only about 1.7 percent of all water on Earth[.]' - Textile Waste Diversion Inc. [3]Glaciers were just a part of my argument to show that ice was melting. The fact that glaciers hold so little of the world's water barely makes any difference in the rise in sea levels, especially since most glaciers exist inland, but not near the oceans, as most glaciers are of the Himalayas, which are inland [4][5]: 'The Himalayan–Karakoram (HK) region has among the largest glacier coverage outside the polar regions[.]' - Estimating the volume of glaciers in the Himalayan–Karakoram region using different methods [5]This alone means that glaciers can be used as evidence for global warming, but NOT to disprove its existence. My opponent's rebuttal is null.==Counter 2: Mixed Methodologies==This, again, is an example of the nitpicking my opponent has done throughout the debate. Correlation =/= imitation. But if my opponent still can't accept my graph, here are the reasons why my opponent's rebuttal isn't coherent:1. My opponent emphasized a lot on the heat waves of the 30's, so the fact that he's using that to try and prove there isn't a correlation is beyond me.2. Where the temperature drops out (more so not) of the correlation is so insignificant that it may as well be part of the correlation. Somehow my opponent thinks that a difference in correlation about a millimeter or less for a graph THAT size still counts as proof that the correlation is false.==Counter 3: Other planets=='When we burn Coal we actually end up taking O2 out of the air, and put in CO2.' - OpponentMy opponent now suddenly agrees that CO2 has a heating effect, which is different from the last few contentions. But if this is untrue, see my previous counter.My opponent also agrees that we are still adding CO2 to the atmosphere, even though oxygen is being taken out of the air. It's basically a concession of this point because my opponent agrees the atmosphere on Venus is thick with greenhous gases. P1) More CO2 in the atmosphere = Earth heats upP2) We are putting more CO2 into the atmosphereC) We are heating up Earth.As for the electromagnetic field, my opponent ignores that Mercury does not have a major electromagnetic field either [6].'Mercury’s magnetic field is 150 times weaker than that of our planet, however.' - Phys.org [6] And with a distance much smaller from the sun than other planets, you'd expect that Mercury would be hotter. However, BECAUSE Venus has such an atmosphere it is simply that much hotter.==Dropped arguments==My opponent drops many arguments in the debate, which is lucky because they seem to be important points.He drops the points:- That natural causes have a much smaller heating effect than with human effects- That positive feedbacks amplify heating effects- That the increase in glaciers is probably due to the brief drops in temperature that were only temporary and caused by humans as well- That methodology changes don't change the actual temperature- That we can't use pan evaporation because it is not relevant to the debate- That temperatures are perfectly fine evidence in terms of this debate- That the corrections made in NASA's graph do not make much difference- That newer sources are usually more trustworthy, especially when made by a government websiteThose are the ones that I can think of at the top of my head, and there could be more. Don't let my opponent respond to them because it is unfair if he responds when I can't.==Conclusion== There are huge holes in my opponent's argument, as well as big contradictions. Their arguments are more like theories (or even just hypotheses) because they nitpick at things if something isn't perfect. And my opponent can throw any theory he wants at me but scientific research somehow, as tylergraham said, always seems to fly in his face.The resolution is soundly affirmed.</t>

    <t>Thank you, medv4380.   ==Contention 1: The correlation between increase in Carbon Dioxide and global temperature==  Throughout the last 650,000 years, there have been seven cycles of glacial advances and retreats, where the carbon dioxide levels abruptly increased, then gradually decreased afterward. However, in 1950, Co2 levels were at a critical level and kept on rising. As of 2014, the global Co2 levels were at an all time high of nearly 400 parts per million [1]:    2 has increased since the Industrial Revolution. (Source: [[LINK     As we can see above, in the last 650,000 years, the Co2 levels have never grown above 300 ppm, as opposed to now, where the Co2 levels are at 400 ppm. Obviously, this abrupt growth in Co2 levels are caused by human activity, such as mass production, the use of electricity, polluting, etc.  I have provided a youtube video above to show the correlation between the high Co2 levels and global temperature [2]. When both are compared, this becomes irrefutable evidence that man-made global warming exists. Note that this is all over the world, so accusations of choosing a specific area for evidence cannot be valid.  In fact, as of 2013, the average global temperature was 14.6 degrees Celsius (58.3 degrees Fahrenheit), which is 0.8 degrees Celsius (1.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than when the year was 1880, and 0.6 degrees Celsius (1.1 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the mid-20th century baseline [3][4][5]:    Already, on the first contention, we have seen major evidence affirming the resolution.  ==Contention 2: The cause and effect of the Greenhouse Effect and what makes it more powerful==  The greenhouse effect on Planet Earth has been occurring for almost its whole life and is a natural phenomenon, since greenhouse gases such as Co2 have existed on Earth from its birth, thus heating the Earth to help sustain forms of life [6]:  'To its credit, the greenhouse effect has been around long before humans began to burn fossil fuels, and it is a natural phenomenon in that makes life habitable for all living things.' [6]  The greenhouse effect operates when the sun's heat passes through Earth's atmosphere, heats the Earth's surface and is reflected back upward. Most of this heat is absorbed by the greenhouse gases like water vapor, Co2 and methane. Afterward, the heat is re-emited in all directions, thus starting the cycle again, continuously heating the Earth. Greenhouse gases literally act like a thermal blanket for Earth [7]:  of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide – act as a thermal blanket for the Earth, absorbing heat and warming the surface to a life-supporting average of 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius).' /gt;  'A layer of greenhouse gases - primarily water vapor, and including much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide - act as a thermal blanket for the Earth, absorbing heat and warming the surface to a life-supporting average of 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius).' [7]  From this information, we can conclude that the more greenhouse gases are put into the atmosphere, the more heat from the sun is absorbed, thus creating a powerful greenhouse effect. Human actvity is causing this to happen.  P1) The more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the more powerful the greenhouse effectP2) Human activity is emitting more greenhouse gases into the atmosphereC) Human activity is the cause of a more powerful greenhouse effect, and thus man-made global warming exists.  To further prove this point, let us inspect Earth's neighboring planets, Mars and Venus.  Mars' atmosphere is quite thin, and it's nearly completely made up of Co2. However, it is because of the low atmospheric pressure and lack of other greenhouse gases that the greenhouse effect is not at all strong and thus Mars has a frozen surface without any signs of organisms [7].  'Not enough greenhouse effect: The planet Mars has a very thin atmosphere, nearly all carbon dioxide. Because of the low atmospheric pressure, and with little to no methane or water vapor to reinforce the weak greenhouse effect, Mars has a largely frozen surface that shows no evidence of life.' [7]  Now, let us inspect Venus.  Despite Venus' atmosphere also being almost entirely carbon dioxide, the amount of Co2 Venus contains is about 300 times as much as Mars' or Earth's. This creates a HUGELY powerful greenhouse effect, causing a temperature so high that lead could not stay solid. [7]  'Too much greenhouse effect: The atmosphere of Venus, like Mars, is nearly all carbon dioxide. But Venus has about 300 times as much carbon dioxide in its atmosphere as Earth and Mars do, producing a runaway greenhouse effect and a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead.' [7]  This can be further proven by checking Mercury's temperature compared to Venus' temperature, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun than Venus. [8]   'Venus has a very dense atmosphere made up of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and sulfuric acid, while Mercury has a very thin atmosphere with various gases, but very little carbon dioxide.' [8]  Again this information is major evidence of the existence of man-made global warming.  ==Contention 3: Arctic Ice and Sea Levels==  It is widely agreed that melting ice from the Arctic and Antarctic and sea level rise is a sign of increasing temperatures. If I can prove that ice is definitely decreasing and that sea levels are definitely rising, then I win this contention.  Here is a chart showing definite decrease in Arctic ice [9]:    Here is another chart showing rising sea levels [10]:    Also, recent reports state that the Arctic is losing ice three times as fast as the Antarctic is gaining ice [11][12].   'Sea ice surrounding Antarctica reached a new record high extent this year, covering more of the southern oceans than it has since scientists began a long-term satellite record to map sea ice extent in the late 1970s. The upward trend in the Antarctic, however, is only about a third of the magnitude of the rapid loss of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean.'  Thus, I affirm this contention.  ==Conclusion==  I have put forward major evidence and arguments proving the existence of man-made global warming. I have also put out evidence that the greenhouse effect does indeed exist.  Thus, the resolution is affirmed.</t>

    <t>Thanks to my opponent! Reading their arguments I can see this will be a great debate! I'd like to remind my opponent that although this is a rebuttal round, per the rules, new arguments can still be made.Also, there was a problem with my sources in the previous round. Rebuttal 1: To doubt =/= To refute==My opponent's first argument poses a few flaws. First of all, the new figure that has been presented has *barely changed* looking at the more recent years of the graph. Also, the change at the start of the graph is a difference of what seems to be less than 0.2 degrees Celcius, which doesn't even change the fact that the warming is significant. But that isn't the point. The point is the question of what to trust. 'Now this claim that the pause doesn't exist poses a problem because a few years ago the claim was that the pause was caused by about 17 volcanoes back as little as 2014. So which is it? Does the pause exist, and was caused by Volcanoes, or does the pause not exist, and was caused by weighting issues in the data? Any reasonable person should now have some doubt in the basic data claims of global warming for a basic contradiction.' - My opponentWhile I can agree that this may pose doubt, I can also ask the audience to *turn* this argument, because more recent updates are and should be seen as more trustworthy, no matter how close they are. Therefore, my opponent's argument here only proves that there was no hiatus and the doubt should be cast on the 2014 update.Finally, I will stress this as much as I can: *This doesn't refute the notion that humans are a significant cause of global warming, because so far it only focuses on temperatures instead of causation.*==Rebuttal 2: Methodology Bias==There is no doubt that methodologies change throughout the course of time, as we advance with new technology. However, shouldn't it be safer to trust more modern methods rather than outdated ones? A lot of my opponent's part 2, 3 and 4 arguments are based solely off the fact that methodologies change, rather than addressing the fact that new methodologies can be used to update old figures, as was done with NASA's figure.Another version of figure 6 in my opponent's round can be seen here [1]:s://www.ncdc.noaa.gov...; alt='Graph showing no slow down in global warming' /gt;What really matters is what my opponent says about his GHCN analysis of the high monthly average delta graph. He claims that the cooling period might explain why figures 4 and 5 start at a certain point. But there wasn't any major increase trend in ice even before the 70's [2]:'Globally glaciers are losing ice at an extensive rate (Figure 1). There are still situations in which glaciers gain or lose ice more than typical for one region or another but the long term trends are all the same, and about 90% of glaciers are shrinking worldwide (Figure 2).' - Skeptical Science [2]Sea levels have also been rising since the 1800's [3]:'A variety of different measurements find steadily rising sea levels over the past century.' - Skeptical Science [3] The most important part is where my opponent claims that the trend is almost nothing and can't be used for future predictions. This graph closely resembles the one found here [4]:This figure was created from the actual temperature rise graphs from choosing the most actively reporting stations.  Unfortunately, my opponent never gives a reason as to why there was a cooling in 1945 - 1970. The reason to this is actually one of my opponent's arguments: methodologies changed right at that time. This would imply that graphed temperatures rapidly changed, and in this case, dropped. [5]Not only that, but the cooling was actually due to sulphate aerosols being released into the atmosphere [5]. Sulphate aerosols reflect solar energy back into space. This was not only caused by humans releasing such aerosols, but also by volcanic eruptions [5]. The greenhouse effect would start dominating climate again in the 70s, and the rapid warming has continued until today [5]. Therefore, rather than arguing we are not a cause of either, we should be discussing that we are the cause of both, and that the cooling was just a temporary decline.==Rebuttal 3: Is The Cause Solar Output?==The crux of my opponent's argument here is that pan evaporation correlates more with solar activity, and that the sudden increase would be because of a rip in the Northern Pole, weaking the Earth's magnetic field. We both agree that the sun's activity has remained quite constant in recent history. However, if the sudden warming were due to this rip, we can logically conclude that the atmosphere would be warmer within all layers as would happen with a situation where the sun actually increased in activity [6]. However, we have actually seen 'a cooling in the upper atmosphere, and a warming at the surface and in the lower parts of the atmosphere. That's because greenhouse gasses are trapping heat in the lower atmosphere.' - NASA [6]Therefore, my opponent's arguments are null.New contentions ==Contention 4: Positive feedbacks strengthen forcings==Forcings are factors that 'force' climate to change. Feedbacks are factors that amplify or diminish the effect of forcings. Because positive feedbacks dominate climate, the effect of forcings are significantly amplified [7]:==Conclusion==The evidence I have put out proves my opponent's arguments null and even contradicting as some of his data does not consider other factors. Therefore, so far a conclusion can be made that human effects do play a big part in global warming. </t>

    <t>Thanks to my opponent for such a great debate!Counter-rebuttals==Counter 1: Contradiction?==My opponent asserts that my glacial, sea level and temperature figures are contradictory. He never considers the fact that there were sudden but brief drops in temperature near to the increase in ice, which both his and my figures agree upon.I don't agree with the way my opponent presents why the amount of ice on Earth is increasing. More glaciers =/= more ice. Simply because there are more glaciers being observed doesn't mean the *amount* of ice is increasing. Don't count on trusting the use of his graph, because it is in a way irrelevant to what we are trying to discuss on this contention.==Counter 2: Hiatus==[Remember: The hiatus is said to have happened in more recent years, so more recent data can be cited.] Con tries to save his argument by stating that I made an appeal to authority to newness, and assumes that it is 'not a rational reason at all'. So what is he implying here? Is he implying that we should trust older methodologies simply because I supposedly committed one logical fallacy that isn't even that much of a negative effect? So far, that's the only basis he has for his argument, and the reason why we can't accept his basis in this case is because it is simply common sense. In most, if not all debates, we are inclined to use the newest and most updated sources, thus more trustworthy sources. We shouldn't try to attack the sources of others simply because it is 'an appeal to the authority of newness', because it isn't - it's just common sense.Where his argument is relevant is interesting, because he seems to not know which one is right or wrong. Even so, the graphs would *still* support my argument. Con doesn't even know if either of them ACTUALLY ARE right or wrong. And with the huge consensus and observed evidence supporting it, the answer leans way towards the Pro stance [1-3]: ==Counter 3: Correlation vs. Causation==Here my opponent essentially nitpicks the slightest flaws in correlation and claims these flaws are deciding factors. First of all, there isn't even supposed to be a direct correlation between CO2 and sea levels - they are FAR from correlating to each other. The CO2 is emitted, then temperature rises, then ice melts, THEN sea levels rise. You can't expect a perfect correlation when they are that far away from each other. Secondly, why must it correlate so perfectly? If they correlate and they are reasonably close, then what does it matter?==Counter 4: Solar Activity==I am shocked that my opponent has assumed that I made an unsupported assumption, *when it is undeniably clear I made a citation supporting my argument.* Let me repeat that. Clearly.And why would we need data from prior to the alleged increase when this is simply logic and facts? The reasoning I had given *perfectly* fits with the scenario being discussed. But if my opponent still isn't happy about that, then I'll explain why it is still null. The warming on Earth is known as global warming. Warming means steady temperature increase. Key word: temperature. So if temperature increasing means pan evapoation is increasing, then why is temperature almost universally agreed to be increasing yet there seems to be no trend in figure 11 for pan evaporation? Obviously this doesn't make sense. So is that figure very trustworthy? The answer: probably not.Also, just to top it off, figures agree that the increase is solely due to human effects [4]: ==Counter 5: Dust Bowl==My opponent continues to not give me a valid reason for the decrease in the median. Of course, he did talk about the droughts and terrible heat waves, but since when did we find out that the aftermath of heat waves would be sudden and big cooling worldwide?And yes, Con did provide extensive explanations about methodological bias, but that wasn't the only thing that caused figures to show a sudden cooling. The other thing was the fact that humans started to use more sulphate aerosols, which cool the Earth [5]. So Con has yet to come up with another reason for the decrease.==Counter 6: Feedbacks and forcings==I apologize for this contention - somehow it got cut out. I will not present the previous graphs, but rather build onto it.So far, we can conclude that positive feedbacks dominate climate and thus amplify the effect of forcings significantly. Climate sensitivity is essential in climate science - it is the rise of equilibrium global land-sea mean temperature each time CO2 concentration is doubled [6]. 'It is defined simply as the global mean warming that is reached in equilibrium (that is, after a long time) after doubling the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.' - Anthropogenic Climate Change: Revisiting the facts [6]With feedbacks, climate sensitivity is about 3 degrees Celcius [7]:The increasing CO2 emissions are predominantly anthropogenic. Combine the forcings increase with the feedback amplification, and you get increasing temperature caused by humans.My opponent seems to not be able to respond to the planets contention, so I will allow them to respond in their next arguments.==Conclusion==Con fails to disprove the evidence I have put forward, making assumptions that are difficult, if not impossible to justify. Thus, I affirm.I await my opponent's arguments!</t>

    <t>You the judges are presented with a problem. Whose statistics, whose figures should you believe?In order to help you I'm going to tell you a short story paraphrased from Professor Helen M Walker that you can find in a book titled “How to lie with Statistics” by Darrell Huff published in 1954 starting on about page 62. If you wish to debate any statistic, or figure you might want to consider reading the book in full.As women get older they toe out more as they walk. It seems like an absurd conclusion, and indeed false, but it is something the data would say at the time. To reach this conclusion you simply survey a large sample of women, and plot their age and angle of their feet, and it would say that at the time. Women who were younger didn't toe out as much as women who were older. However, it is wrong because it's assuming the younger women are a valid reconstructed past of the older women. The issue is actually that the older women toed out more even when they were younger as well because it was a generational fad that faded over time with each generation. The correct way to do this analysis would be to take women born at around the same time like 1900, and measure them once each year over a period of time like 115 years. Only then would you be able to tell if women toe out more as they grow older.This highlights the major problem with global warming data. It assumes that adding in a large volume of weather stations at different periods of time that have no past to compare to won't cause any deviation in their data. It assumed that adding in data from volunteer ships for the first half of the century, but not the later half wouldn't affect their data until adjusting it in a favorable way appeared to remove part of the argument.If we had no choice I'd agree that this method is flawed, but there exists no alternative. However, we have a sufficiently large number of weather stations that have been in operation from 1900 to Present. But this basic analysis for checking to see if sampling bias, and methodology bias is the actual cause of the change is ignored. There exists no funding of additional projects that says there is no measurable change in temperature in the last 115 years. There is no renewal of tenure for the professor who can only publish once that there is nothing here on a subject, and then must find another controversy to publish on.As for the Hiatus, if you understand my argument at this point you should have a clue as to what it actually is. Over the years we've added so many weather stations that by the mid 90's that ability to manipulate the data by adding more sample would require adding 5 to 10 thousand samples. They'd finally reached the point where the law of large numbers overwhelmed them, and adding a few hundred only accounted for a few percentage points to the total sample. The cost of adding non randomized weather station sample exceeded their desire.The evaporation data by itself is all that is needed to prove man is not a significant player in global warming. The rest is ether to confirm the finding like how stable evaporation had been prior to 2005, and 2010. Or to discredit, and confront the poor methods used to support my opponent's argument.If the evaporation data couldn't show changes in the Earth's Atmospheric energy then it would remain flat regardless of any change in the environment. However, we know it does change, and changed with the predictions from NASA that the Earth would be subjected to more solar storms than we normally do for Solar Cycle 24 due to an unexpected effect in our electromagnetic field. The correlation is so pristine that it even has the same peaks and valleys. If it can change for that in such a fine tuned way then why doesn't it so the change for man caused global warming? There are only two answers. Either man caused global warming is insignificant compared to the solar effect, and is drowned out by the subtle noise. Or that it is nonexistent. Ether conclusion fully supports my argument.I've undermined, and instilled doubt into my opponent's argument. That isn't to get you to vote for me. That is only to give you a reason to listen so that I can give you the time of day. You will vote for me because you will have looked at the evaporation data I've presented, and come to the same rational conclusion.Man Made Global Warming has nothing to do with the enhanced levels of energy in our atmosphere over the last decade, and is insignificant, or nonexistent compared to the natural cause: Solar Storms breaking through our Electromagnetic Field.Thank you for letting me give you the time of day.</t>

  <pair id="231" entailment="NONENTAILMENT" task="IE">
    <t>Contention 1: CO2 and Temperatures. First, let's bring up just how much these accused compounds exactly warm the Earth's atmosphere. CO2 for example has the global warming potential of 1. Here are the other numbers. Carbon Dioxide -- 1Methane -- 21Nitrous Oxide -- 298-310CFC's -- VariousWater Vapor -- 0.25 [1]  Now, I just want you to keep this in mind for this next part here. We may observe that humans release approximately 35 gigatons of CO2 a year. [2] This is only 4.3% of the total amount of all Global Warming Gasses, however it is incrediably small when it comes to comparing the rest of the Global Warming gasses. If we observe the chart bellow we can see that Water Vapor is a large Contributor to Global Warming at 95% and CO2 comes in second. But here's the kicker. If we look at the Human contributed part that I'm about to post in the graph bellow we can see that it's very miniscule of 0.117% of all total Warming gasses. Now let's do some quick math here. CO2's increase was from what my opponent is claiming is from 295 ppm to 400ppm, a total of only 105 ppm. 1 Gigaton of CO2 is the equilivent of 2.13 ppm. [3] This means that increase of 105 ppm means a total of 49.29 gigatons. Since 1 gigaton of CO2 is the equivilance of .004% of the Greenhouse effect that means that 49.29 gigatons means an aditional .21% increase to Global Warming. This would account for a grand total of a 0.15 F increase in global temperature. This is a very measly amount and we can see that with my opponent's claims a simple 0.15 F increase isn't enough to melt glacers and have the effeccts that he is speaking of and it proves that this is NAUTRAL not man-made to fulfil his effects if they were real.     The above graph shows that comparisions of C13 (Carbon isotope) and this shows that there is little to no trend pertrade in many of these as the average is zero while the trend for all of these are zero. [4] This is important as the Carbon isotope is important in measuring this so called 'Global Warming.'   Let us observe the above graph. Here I would like to point out the that the increase from Pre-Inustrial to Industrial era and the doubling of the CO2 leveling lead to a decrease in it's temperature. Also we can see that the 10 mile 'hot-spot' above the tropics is actually absent. 'The computer models show that greenhouse warming will cause a hot-spot at an altitude between 8 and 12 km over the tropics between 30 N and 30 S. The temperature at this hot-spot is projected to increase at a rate of two to three times faster than at the surface. However, the Hadley Centre's real-world plot of radiosonde temperature observations shown below does not show the projected CO2 induced global warming hot-spot at all. The predicted hot-spot is entirely absent from the observational record. This shows that atmosphere warming theory programmed into climate models are wrong.' [5]Now if we observe the above graph of the past 400,000 yeasrs we can see that the CO2 rates in our atmosphere has flutated the exact same way in this cycle both before and during the existance of human beings. We can see that the temperatures and CO2 levels have been going up and down randomly for the past 100 thousands years and it is observed that this occured before the industrial revolution. We can also see that right now we are in a warming period so that arguing that humans are because of this is post hoc. Not to mention that we are in the coldest of the warming periods in Earth's history!We can see that once again despite contrary to belief we can see that though there may be warming the fact is simply that there is no human warming.  Contention 2: Earth is cooling.  If we observe the above graph we can see that Earth has been a whole lot hotter than where we currently are to the point where the Earth's average temperature has been 7.5 degrees Celcuis hotter than it currently it is. You can also see that in the span of the past 10,000 years the temperature has leveld off, but you may ask yourself where does that place us in the lights of modern day?  I am going to site Dr. Done Easterbrook, who is a climate scientist. Back in 2000 he predicted that Earth was entering a cooling phase. He predicts that for the next 20 years Earth will cool by 3/10 degree each year and that we are going to enter another little Ice Age like we did from 1650 and 1790. (6) The funny thing is that many of my opponent's charts are actually from the incorrect IPPC. How about the 'Hockey Stick' graph that many Global Warming supporters , including my opponent, argue about? Well if we observe the fallowing chart taken from Northern Scandenavia we can see that the Global trend over the past 1,000 years that the Global Cooling trend slope is that of -0.31 Degrees Celcuis, give or take 0.03 degrees (for the error room). Professor Dr. Jan Esper has found that the Earth's temperature of Earth actually decreases 0.3 per millenia due to the Earth moving away from the sun. (7)   Here is another graph from 1920 to 2005 and we can see that the graph has a negative temperature slope, thus meaning that the Earth is under a period of cooling. (8) You can see in terms of more Warming in the evidence in which Scientists use Ice Cores Earth has actually been Cooling the past Mellenium. You can see that in terms of Gasses contribution to the Green House Effect the major contributer is Water Vapor and it's at 95% to CO2's 3.6% and this is the overall contribution including man made and natural. When we look to the chart on the left we can see that Man-Made CO2 does have a higher contribution to the atmosphere than Water Vapor, but that's because we do not create much water vapor as humans. Even with this evidence we can see that CO2 does not have any effect what-so-ever compared to Water Vapor. (9) Where might those CFCs be on this graph you may ask. Why it's under the Misc. gases section. Once again, we can see that the IPCC and Al Gore are inccorect as the hocky stick graph is a bust. As I've shown in earlier rounds and they have been dropped in showing that the Earth's temperature has indeed been way hotter then current and on an average basis at that. My opponent has also dropped my opening graph in C1 r2 That also showed that CO2 levels are at an all time low! Thus once again disproving my opponent's theory.Here we can see that even though CO2 levels are increaseing that the temperature in recent years has actually decreased on the linear scale. Also, the US Senate Committe on Envirnment and public works also took a stab at this issue. They found that the Hocky Stick graph was also bogus in 2006. “Today’s NAS report reaffirms what I have been saying all along, that Mann's ‘hockey stick’ is broken,”Senator Inhofe said.“Today’s report refutes Mann's prior assertions that there was no Medieval Warm Period or Little Ice Age.” “This report shows that the planet warmed for about 200 years prior to the industrial age, when we were coming out of the depths of the Little Ice Age where harsh winters froze the Thames and caused untold deaths. “Trying to prove man-made global warming by comparing the well-known fact that today's temperatures are warmer than during the Little Ice Age is akin to comparing summer to winter to show a catastrophic temperature trend.” [10]Paleoclimate scientist Bob Carter had shown through his research at University of East Angila in the United Kingdom that the Climate Change increase had actually froze from 1998-2006 showing that this so called Global Warming had actually stopped. </t>

    <t>C1) Positive feedbacks dominate climate  Carbon dioxide has a significant influence on global land-sea mean temperature. All scientists agree that CO2 has some direct effect, increasing temperature by 1.1 degrees Celsius per doubling of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. David Evans argues, “Most serious skeptical scientists have always agreed with the government climate scientists about the direct effect of CO2. The argument is entirely about the feedbacks.” [1]   Climate sensitivity is the key point in all of climate science. The term ‘climate sensitivity’ refers to -- in this context -- the rise in equilibrium global land-sea mean temperature per doubling of the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere [2]. A 2005 study by Nir Joseph Shaviv confirms that the climate sensitivity, without any amplification, is 1.1 degrees Celsius [3]. Most serious scientists agree. The argument, as Evans argues, is about the feedbacks.   What is a feedback? A feedback is a climate process that amplifies or dampens the effect of a climate forcing. A climate forcing is any factor that influences temperature increase, in this case referring to CO2. So, a feedback is anything that amplifies or dampens the effect of CO2 on climate. Feedbacks that amplify it are called positive feedbacks, while those that dampen it are negative ones [4]. I argue that positive feedbacks dominate climate, and therefore, increase the overall effect of CO2 on temperature.     Various studies report positive feedbacks as more likely. Soden and Held report a 2 degree celsius climate sensitivity due to positive feedbacks. The study reports very few negative feedbacks. “Water vapor is found to provide the largest positive feedback in all models and its strength is consistent with that expected from constant relative humidity changes in the water vapor mixing ratio. The feedbacks from clouds and surface albedo are also found to be positive in all models, while the only stabilizing (negative) feedback comes from the temperature response.” [5] A 2003 study by Colman reports a feedback of nearly 3 degrees celsius, and the paper is cited by Soden and Held. In the study, “[a] comparison is performed for water vapour, cloud, albedo and lapse rate feedbacks taken from published results of ‘offline’ feedback calculations for general circulation models (GCMs) with mixed layer oceans performing 2 x CO2 and solar perturbation experiments.” [6]  There is much evidence outside climate models as well. Wigley, et al.  report a possible sensitivity of greater than 4.5 degrees celsius due to volcanic forcings, and supports an average sensitivity of 3.5 degrees. The study says, “After the maximum cooling for low-latitude eruptions, the temperature relaxes back toward the initial state with an e-folding time of 29–43 months for sensitivities of 1–4 degrees C equilibrium warming for CO2 doubling.” [7] A 2005 study by Forster and Gregory also uses volcanic forcings and feedbacks, and finds a climate sensitivity range of 1 - 4.1 degrees Celsius [8].   Even in a hypothetical scenario where negative feedbacks cancel out positive feedbacks to a climate sensitivity of 1 degree C, research by Ziskin and Shaviv (2011) has predicted that “the largest contribution to the 20th century warming comes from anthropogenic sources.” [9] They find that of the ~0.7 degree C temperature rise in the 20th century (some estimates slightly higher), about 0.4 degrees of that are due to anthropogenic forgings, or about 57% of the warming.  Nonetheless, climate sensitivity is likely much higher than that. Research by Patrick Michaels, a CATO scholar, found that the amplifier was 1.6 degrees C [10]. This means that human activity causing global warming is much greater than 57%, even under these low estimates. I still maintain that sensitivity is somewhere around 2 - 3 degrees C. A study by leading climatologist JD Annan -- using the Bayesian statistical approach -- found a mean sensitivity of 3 degrees Celsius [11]. The following graph describes the consensus in the literature on climate sensitivity [12].     The following picture portrays the evidence regarding climate sensitivity.     As such, I conclude that the effect of the rise in CO2 on climate is huge.   C2) Evidence from paleoclimatology  The paleoclimatological record is clear that CO2 has become the chief climate forcing in the Cenozoic Era (which began after the Cretaceous mass-extinction event 65.5 million years ago). Overall, solar activity has increased by 40% in this period. James E. Hansen and Makiko Sato argue, “The sun’s brightness increased steadily through the Cenozoic, by about 0.4 percent according to solar physics models (Sackmann et al., 1993). Because Earth absorbs about 240 W/m^2 of solar energy, that brightness increase is a forcing of about 1 W/m^2 . This small linear increase of forcing, by itself, would have caused a modest global warming through the Cenozoic Era.” [13] It’s clear that “CO2 was the dominant forcing in the Cenozoic.” [13]   The temperature changes correspond to the changes in CO2 levels. Take the example of the Vostok ice cores. A study by French and Russian institutes says, “There is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr.” [14]  This graph shows the correlations between CO2 and temperature over the past 200,000 years.     There is proof that it is warmer now than since the Medieval Warm Period. In fact, it is warmer now than any year since 1400 [15]. Another study that replicated previous ‘hockey stick’ studies shows the following data [16].     Thus, paleoclimatology confirms that CO2 influences climate at huge levels.   C3) Human activity  I have now established that CO2 is responsible for much more that 57% of global warming, somewhere around 75%. Now, I must establish that humans are responsible for much of CO2 generation. First, a simple correlation -- CO2 levels rose with the beginning of industrial activity [17]. The following graph shows CO2 concentrations over the last 10,000 years.     If the ratio between C-14 and C-12 decline, the observation would virtually confirm that human activity is responsible for increase in CO2 concentration. This is because the CO2 emissions humans make come from fossil fuels [18]. This has been observed [19].   Thus, human activity has influenced CO2 decline and CO2 is a driving force of climate. Therefore, I affirm. </t>

    <t>HOUSEKEEPING1. In my Round 2 argument, I mistakenly wrote, 'I have now established that [human activity] is responsible for much more that 57% of global warming, somewhere around 75%.' I meant to write 65%, which is the actual number. That is an approximate estimate, and my estimate is closer to 62.5% of the warming (which means human activity has caused 85% of global warming since 1975, indicating a climate sensitivity of around 2 degrees C).2. Con writes, 'My opponent has also dropped my opening graph in C1 r2 That also showed that CO2 levels are at an all time low! Thus once again disproving my opponent's theory.' Note that I couldn't have dropped anything, since this *is* Con's C1, R2.  CON's CASEOverviews1. Con's first contention is a defense. It doesn't give any offense, i.e. does not provide a reason for judges to vote for his side. Con argues that CO2 does not have an effect, which merely preempts an argument that asserts that CO2 does have an effect. I ask judges to take this into consideration. I will refute that argument anyway.  2. The second contention Con presents is a 'kritik' of the topic. A 'kritik' is defined as an argument that challenges an assumption in the resolution. The second contention says global warming doesn't even exist, therefore is not man-made. Therefore, its topicality is indirect, making it a 'kritik.' Rule 6 prohibits 'kritiks.' Please note this violation. C1. Carbon Dioxide and TemperaturesCarbon dioxide does not exactly correlate with temperature. However, the radiative forcing of CO2 and the sun allows for a direct correlation. The sun drives much of modern climate change. The most recent spurt of global warming was caused by the sun, thus carbon dioxide drives climate change and is a major forcing. [1] The below graph illustrates a correlation between the forcings of the sun and CO2, and the rise in temperature. [2]  The effects of carbon dioxide increase due to positive feedback amplification. Feedbacks such as volcanic activity and clouds can significantly expand the impact of carbon dioxide on temperature. [3] The below graph depicts the correlation between carbon dioxide and temperatures over the last 700,000 years.A comparison of the warming between the troposphere and the stratosphere can demonstrate this. Majority of atmospheric carbon dioxide is found in the upper troposphere, entailing that carbon dioxide would cause higher temperatures in the troposphere than in the stratosphere. [4, 5] The following graph depicts the temperature effect of CO2 in the troposphere and stratosphere. [6] Robert Berner and Zavareth Kothavala argue, ' The exact values of CO2...should not be taken literally...[O]ver the long term, there is indeed a correlation between CO2 and paleotemperature.' [7] The following graph shows the uncertainty of values of CO2. [8]Furthermore, I can turn the entire argument against Con. This is primarily because many of the greenhouse gases mentioned - with high global warming potentials - act as positive feedbacks. Water vapor, the greenhouse gas that has the highest effect on climate, as conceded by Con, also acts as the largest positive feedback. Brian J. Soden and Isaac M. Held write, 'Water vapor is found to provide the largest positive feedback in all models and its strength is consistent with that expected from constant relative humidity changes in the water vapor mixing ratio. The feedbacks from clouds and surface albedo are also found to be positive in all models, while the only stabilizing (negative) feedback comes from the temperature response.' [9] This means the effects of water vapor help my case. A positive feedback loop would also allow CO2 level increase to cause an increase in the water vapor concentration in the atmosphere. 'When CO2 is added to the atmosphere, as a greenhouse gas it has a warming effect. This causes more water to evaporate and warm the air more to a higher (more or less) stabilized level. So CO2 warming has an amplified effect, beyond a purely CO2 effect...Without any feedbacks, a doubling of CO2 would warm the globe around 1 degree C. Taken on its own, water vapour feedback roughly doubles the amount of CO2 warming. When other feedbacks are included (eg - loss of albedo due to melting ice), the total warming from a doubling of CO2 is around 3 degrees Celsius.' [10] This is affirmed by the research of Soden and Held, who find that water vapor is the primary atmospheric feedback on Earth. [11]C2. The Temperature of the EarthAll my opponents studies are faulty and unreliable. These are the reasons. Firstly, my opponent's first graph shows the temperature of the Earth in relation to the temperature of the Earth millions of years ago. This can be discredited, because 'global warming' only began in the 19th century, after the Earth was relatively normal. The definition of global warming given in the debate concerns the 19th century. Discredit the first graph. Secondly, the idea of the 'global warming hiatus,' which my opponent brings up, is flawed. My opponent's data is largely based on TSS data. UAH and HADCRUT4 data both show that the Earth has been continuing to warm throughout the last 15 years. [12, 13] Further, the long-term trend of increasing temperatures is due to CO2. Short-term variability happens all the time; it does not mean that the long-term increase is going to stabilize forever. Oscillation phenomena, or 'La Nena' phenomena, will result in the trend changing, but will revert to a positive trend eventually. [14] Thirdly, the heat content of Earth is actually increasing. 'This new research combines measurements of oceanheat, land and atmosphere warming and ice melting to find that our climate system continued to accumulate heatthrough to 2008...Since 1970, the Earth's heat content has been rising at a rate of 6 x 10^21 Joules per year.' [15] The below graph represents this. [16] Also, 'Foster and Rahmstorf (2011) used multiple linear regression to filter out the effects of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and solar and volcanic activity (Figure 2), and found that the underlying global surface and lower atmospherewarming trends have remained very steady in recent years.' [15] The below graph portrays the data. [17]Con then reiterates the argument from water vapor, which is addressed above. He then straw-mans my position, since I did not present the hockey stick graph. Thus, I affirm. Over to Con!</t>

    <t>I would like to thank my opponent for accepting this challenge.I'd like to remind the audience, and my opponent, before we get to far on the definition of Global Warming, and clarify any ambiguity. The round 1 definition should be sufficient, but to clarify Global Warming is the changes to the environment caused by manmade pollution. Pollution would be excess CO2, SO2, and so on. My opponent did not object, or provide an alternative definition in round 1 so I assume he accepts the definition.I will be presenting a controversial view that Global Warming has not accelerated the water cycle. This will have actual analysis of weather station data from NOAA. It is a large dataset, and I am willing to show anyone who asks how to begin analysing it. The Evaporation data is small enough to analyse in excel, but precipitation data would require a database or custom tools to work with. Analysis Method:In order to estimate precipitation, and evaporation levels I will be utilizing the NOAA GHCND weather station dataset. If you wish to download and verify the dataset can be found here: ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/1. To process this data the first step is to convert each stations monthly 31 day values into a single monthly median value for each station.2. Then each stations monthly median values are averages to create the average median for the life of the station.3. The station average median is then subtracted from the station median to create a delta that represents that stations change away from the average median.4. Stations are then selected based on the date of operation. For analysis starting in 1900 all weather stations that were operational in 1900 and operational at the end of the analysis must be used. Weather stations that were not operational at the start of the analysis cannot be used because they will induce an unknown bias that cannot be accounted for.5. From there the data can be graphed, or each months delta for the year can be averaged to create a yearly change for a simpler graph. 1900 to Present Precipitation:The Figure 1 below shows the change in precipitation from 1900 to 2015. As shown the precipitation for 1900 to 1930 stays consistently above the average median by about 1mm. The graph of SO2 emissions is there to demonstrate the correlation found in Global Dimming is present in this data. SO2 impedes precipitation by blocking the amount of light that reaches ocean organisms like Phytoplankton that create critical rain cloud compounds[1]. It also cutbacks on plant life by reducing light which also means less water in the air from plant transpiration which is what 90% of the water a plant gets is used for[5].As SO2 emissions were successfully cut back in 1990 there is a clear indication of an increase in precipitation. At most it increased to similar levels in the 40's and 50's up until around 2005. It is my burden to prove that the radical increase post 2005 in precipitation is clearly caused by factors not created by man.Figure 1: 1971 to Present Pan Evaporation Rate: Fortunately, NOAA's dataset does provide additional detail to see what may have changed in Figure 2. If evaporation increased due to additional heat it should appear in the Pan Evaporation rate. Regretfully there is an insufficient number of stations with pan evaporation rate data going back to 1900 so to increase the number of stations to a sufficient number for analysis the start date has been moved to 1971 allowing us to use 124 stations.Rather than show a gradual increase evaporation from gradual warming the pan evaporation stays constant from 1971 until about 2010-2011 where it then makes a radical change which correlates to the radical change in precipitation.Figure 2: 1980 to Present Precipitation and Evaporation:In order to get a better idea of what is happening the date range will need to be compressed further to allow the number of stations to be increased for further analysis. This way we will have 10,209 stations for precipitation, and 156 stations for evaporation for monthly analysis. We can see in Figure 3 better detail what a 20% decrease in SO2 pollution did to the precipitation rate. Unfortunately the increase in 2005, and later, was due to China, and India having increased SO2 pollution[7].Now we can see a mild increase in evaporation starting in 2005, and the shift in 2010 can be isolated to October 2010 using a box and whiskers analysis on the dataset to flag outliers.Figure 3: Solar Forcing of Evaporation:October 2010 is a very important time period. It marks a violent beginning of the Sun's solar cycle 24 approach to solar maximum as shown with NASA's October 18th 2010 image of the Sun ramping up for a Solar Flare[8]. Note in the Figure 4 October 2010 is not solar maximum, but the significant shift upwards in sunspot. By graphing the Sun's Sunspots it is possible to see if cycle 24 had an actual influence on the evaporation rate. Clearly the increase in evaporation has many of the same features as cycle 24 in Figure 4. However, none of the prior cycles appear to have any significant influence. However, in 2008 NASA announced that they had discovered the Earth's Electromagnetic Field was weakening[2]. This weakening most likely began before it was detected leading one to believe that higher than normal levels of light, and radiation began to leak in explaining the small increase during the previous solar minimum. As the field began weakening further evaporation accelerated. This also feed more plants, and phytoplankton allowing for more rapid development of rain clouds post 2005.Now that the Earth's field is weakening 10 times faster[3] than before explaining the continued increase even thow sunspots are on the decline. None of the increases above 1900 to 1930 norms can be attributed to any man made causes, and is entirely separate from any global warming claims. The accelerated water cycle is caused by the complex machinations of the Sun, and Earth's Magnetic Field.</t>

    <t>My opponent appears to be under the mistaken impression that I've plagiarized my argument, and my chart data. No evidence is provided, and no proof could ever be provided because the chart data, and analysis is my own analysis of the publicly available Global Historical Climatology Network Data. I've also cited the pertinent NASA, and NOAA sources that support the analysis of my data, but they are only pieces of the whole.  It's interesting that my opponent has spent the time trolling though my profile looking for personal attacks. Why my opponent thinks the career or Programmer is some how a negative for this debate I can only defer to my opponents claims to their own schooling in Round 2. In order to process the GHCN Data the skills of a programmer are critical. The data consists of just over 98 thousand files, and is about 14 gigs compressed into a single 3 gig file. Oracle would call what I do the work of a Data Scientist, and my employer prefers the moniker Research Analyst. I just happen to prefer Programmer to all the other possible titles.  Perhaps my opponent would have had more fun had they used their real profile rather than one a throw away one.But that is neither here nor there. I welcome my opponents rebuttal.</t>
