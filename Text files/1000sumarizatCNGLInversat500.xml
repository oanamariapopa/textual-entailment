    <t>I would like to remind my opponent that they had ample time to review what the arguments would be long before even accepting the debate.  My opponent makes the claim that global warming is bad, and should be stopped. However, this is contingent on the existence of global warming. One of the claims of global warming is that it has accelerated the water cycle, and my claim is that global warming has not. If one of the claims of global warming is in doubt that it is reasonable to doubt that global warming exists as claimed.  As for the quality of the water cycles nature as Good, or Bad that is irrelevant to this debate, and subjective. An accelerated water cycle would mean more fresh water, and many people are in need of more fresh water. However, it could also make large storms more prevalent for others. It is irrelevant since this debate is about global warming having caused it, and not about if it is good, or bad.</t>

    <t>Dam Rivers:I like that river in Egypt - De Nile. Fun fact, since 1970 the Nile in Egypt hasn’t done it’s annual floods. Amazing isn’t it? A river iconified in myth, and legend representing the cycles of death and rebirth though its life giving floods depositing fertile silt hasn’t flooded in almost 4 and a half decades. It’s amazing what changes the Aswan Dam has done to the Nile for Egypt.My opponent brings up an important point about the freshwater river mouth surge data, and that it is of a very limited time frame of 1994 to 2006. That wouldn’t actually contradict my data since from 1990 there was in an increasing trend in precipitation due to a reduction in SO2 pollution. However, it has an even bigger flaw. Even if there was an increase in precipitation there is very little reason it would actually increase the outflow of water at a river mouth. Perhaps two centuries ago it would have, but over the last 200 years we have left very few rivers free of hydro engineering[9].Any excess water has a much better chance of being banked into the world's reservoir system then it has of just being flushed downstream. It’s not like we don’t have irrigation networks built to divert overflow in one reservoir into other depleted reservoirs[11][12].'Our reservoir system is built so that as one reservoir fills that water spills over into another reservoir,' Libby Pischel[13]So why would we have any increase in river water at the mouth of a river unless we did it deliberately? If the last reservoir on a river overflows then it would have no where to go, but the last reservoir only represents a small fraction of the dammed water. A more likely cause is increased electrical demand. If we want to utilize the water for electricity we have to send it down to the next dam so it can use it for electricity[14]. Then there is fish and wildlife maintenance were we deliberately maintain a higher rate of speed to keep the fish healthy[15]. One may be able to argue that the over dammed waterways are a detriment, or a boom. However, there is hardly a single cubic foot of water that leave waterways that we didn’t intend on it leaving. Had my opponent's source been able to tap into a larger samples with with less of a limited sampling bias by having river data from prior to the rise of dams they may have come to a different conclusion.Global Historical Climatology Network:The advantage to the GHCN data that I’ve processed is that is that is contains all of the world's weather station data.  It makes it possible to attempt to verify what is, or is not wrong with my opponent's source that claims that there has been a 12% increase in weather ‘events’. Unfortunately, the actual study is hidden behind a nice pay wall, but the abstract can be read here. It is also cross references another study at the American Meteorological Society[17], and the PDF can be viewed here. The first problem with all studies of extreme precipitation events can be summarized by quoting a part of the 2nd page on the study above.These and other studies, which all differ in their methods of analysis, definition of extreme precipitation indices, and/or the observational datasets used, consistently report increases in extreme precipitation in more land locations globally than locations with decreases.In other words the definition of ‘extreme precipitation’ is a cherry picked definition, and all of these are only of ‘extreme’ events, and not a sum, average, or median of the precipitation. The reason they don’t use the far more direct argument is that would be Figure 1, and it disagrees with their world view.Further analysis of my opponents source reveals a claim that shows that their results are nothing more than an anomaly caused by their statistical methodology. To quote his sourceThe average increase is 12 percent globally – but 56 percent in South East Asia56% is an outlier nearly 4 and a half times away from the average, and should have flagged the results for closer scrutiny. A closer examination of the South East Asia, SEA, precipitation data in GHCN data shows the cause as limited sampling bias. In other words, SEA has about 369 weather stations reporting precipitation data. However, the earliest weather stations started reporting in 1943: SONGKHLA, DON MUANG, CHIANG MAI, and UDON THANI. A statistically viable sample doesn’t even exist until 1950 when about 30 to 100 stations are reporting. That puts the majority of SEA’s measurements after Global Dimming had reduced the precipitation rate so it stands to reason that they’d see an increase in ‘extreme’ precipitation when rain started to return to normal in 1990.By including weather station with varying limited sampling bias like SEA they induced a non response bias into their 12% figure. This kind of bias is actually addressed in my analysis in step 4. By restricting the analysis to only include those that existed at the start, and at the end non response bias is mitigated only to events that may have shut a station down for a period of time. Limited sampling bias is also addressed by using the largest date range, and maintain a suitably large sample size.Humidity:As for my opponents 3rd source that attempts to prove that humidity has escalated due to global warming it suffers from the same deficiencies as his other sources. Namely limited sampling bias. The study uses only time period of 1973 to 2007 which means that it falls completely under the Clean Air Act of 1970 where SO2 emissions were held back and then reduced in the 90’s. Because of their samples limited score they’d be unable to determine if the cause was out of line with an atmosphere returning more to a 1930’s era, or if it was global warming.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank my opponent for accepting this challenge.I will be presenting a controversial view that Global Warming has not accelerated the water cycle. This will have actual analysis of weather station data from NOAA. It is a large dataset, and I am willing to show anyone who asks how to begin analysing it. The Evaporation data is small enough to analyse in excel, but precipitation data would require a database or custom tools to work with.Analysis Method:In order to estimate precipitation, and evaporation levels I will be utilizing the NOAA GHCND weather station dataset. If you wish to download and verify the dataset can be found here: ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/ 1) To process this data the first step is to convert each stations monthly 31 day values into a single monthly median value for each station.2) Then each stations monthly median values are averages to create the average median for the life of the station.3) The station average median is then subtracted from the station median to create a delta that represents that stations change away from the average median.4) Stations are then selected based on the date of operation. For analysis starting in 1900 all weather stations that were operational in 1900 and operational at the end of the analysis must be used. Weather stations that were not operational at the start of the analysis cannot be used because they will induce an unknown bias that cannot be accounted for.5) From there the data can be graphed, or each months delta for the year can be averaged to create a yearly change for a simpler graph. 1900 to Present Precipitation The Figure 1 below shows the change in precipitation from 1900 to 2015. As shown the precipitation for 1900 to 1930 stays consistently above the average median by about 1mm. The graph of SO2 emissions is there to demonstrate the correlation found in Global Dimming is present in this data. SO2 impedes precipitation by blocking the amount of light that reaches ocean organisms like Phytoplankton that create critical rain cloud compounds[1]. It also cutbacks on plant life by reducing light which also means less water in the air from plant transpiration which is what 90% of the water a plant gets is used for[5].As SO2 emissions were successfully cut back in 1990 there is a clear indication of an increase in precipitation. At most it increased to similar levels in the 40’s and 50’s up until around 2005. It is my burden to prove that the radical increase post 2005 in precipitation is clearly caused by factors not created by man.Figure 1:1971 to Present Pan Evaporation Rate:Fortunately, NOAA’s dataset does provide additional detail to see what may have changed in Figure 2. If evaporation increased due to additional heat it should appear in the Pan Evaporation rate. Regretfully there is an insufficient number of stations with pan evaporation rate data going back to 1900 so to increase the number of stations to a sufficient number for analysis the start date has been moved to 1971 allowing us to use 124 stations.Rather than show a gradual increase evaporation from gradual warming the pan evaporation stays constant from 1971 until about 2010-2011 where it then makes a radical change which correlates to the radical change in precipitation.Figure 2:1980 to Present Precipitation and EvaporationIn order to get a better idea of what is happening the date range will need to be compressed further to allow the number of stations to be increased for further analysis. This way we will have 10,209 stations for precipitation, and 156 stations for evaporation for monthly analysis. We can see in Figure 3 better detail what a 20% decrease in SO2 pollution did to the precipitation rate. Unfortunately the increase in 2005, and later, was due to China, and India having increased SO2 pollution[7].Now we can see a mild increase in evaporation starting in 2005, and the shift in 2010 can be isolated to October 2010 using a box and whiskers analysis on the dataset to flag outliers.Figure 3:Solar Forcing of Evaporation:October 2010 is a very important time period. It marks a violent beginning of the Sun’s solar cycle 24 approach to solar maximum[8]. By graphing the Sun’s Sunspots it is possible to see if cycle 24 had an actual influence on the evaporation rate. Clearly the increase in evaporation has many of the same features as cycle 24 in Figure 4. However, none of the prior cycles appear to have any significant influence. However, in 2008 NASA announced that they had discovered the Earth's Electromagnetic Field was weakening[2]. This weakening most likely began before it was detected leading one to believe that higher than normal levels of light, and radiation began to leak in explaining the small increase during the previous solar minimum. As the field began weakening further evaporation accelerated. This also feed more plants, and phytoplankton allowing for more rapid development of rain clouds post 2005.Now that the Earth's field is weakening 10 times faster[3] than before explaining the continued increase even thow sunspots are on the decline. None of the increases above 1900 to 1930 norms can be attributed to any man made causes, and is entirely separate from any global warming claims. The accelerated water cycle is caused by the complex machinations of the Sun, and Earth's Magnetic Field.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank medv4380 for presenting his arguments.The Water CycleI want to start by providing a brief description of the water cycle, and what it means to accelerate the water cycle. At the most basic level, the water cycle is the explanation of why precipitation occurs. Water evaporates from the oceans as a result of solar heat input, rises into the atmosphere, condenses as the air gets cooler (forming clouds), moves on land, releases its water, which heads back circuitously into the ocean. Here is a picture showing the many intricacies of the water cycle:[1]The acceleration of the water cycle would mean that the cycle is becoming stronger - more water evaporates, implying that more precipitation occurs. It is my burden, then, to show that more precipitation is occurring now compared to 115 years ago.Global Warming and the Water CycleAt the most basic level, a warmer climate would mean that there would be more precipitation, because more water would evaporate from the oceans, due to the fact that the chance of a water molecule in the oceans breaking free of its bonds with other water molecules would be more likely to escape, and given enougn kinetic energy (and it's moving in the right direction), the water would do so. While the climate does work like this, the climate is a bit more complicated than that. Some places will get dryer because warmer climates dry the soil out faster, and regions that don't typically get a lot of rain can suffer as a result.There are many ways one can observe an acceleration of the climate cycle. One obvious way would be to find that the amount of precipitation falling around the Earth is increasing. This is indeed the case. 'An advanced statistical analysis of rainfall data from the years 1901 to 2010 derived from thousands of weather stations around the globe shows that over 1980-2010 there were 12 percent more of these events than expected in a stationary climate, a scenario without global warming.' This seems to show that global warming is accelerating the water cycle. However, there are many other indicators that this is so.[2]One could look at how much water is being evaporated from the oceans and how much water is running off in rivers, for example (we'd expect an increase in both of these indicators).  A measure of how much water is being evaporated is humidity - a measure of the 'saturation' of the atmosphere (the atmosphere can only hold so much water vapor; humidity measures the percentage of this amount). The greater the evaporation, the greater the global humidity, because there's more water vapor in the atmosphere. 'All five reanalyses produce similar relations, with increasing surface temperature being associated with increasing atmospheric specific humidity. These results agree with previous analyses that the water vapor feedback in response to shortR08; term variations is strongly positive. This is also consistent with P09, who looked at the seasonal cycle in the extratropics in the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis and found that it showed a positive correlation between surface temperature and 500 hPa specific humidity.'[3]How much water is being run off in rivers?  'For the relatively short 13-year period studied here, global discharge increased by 540 km^3W25;y^2 [this is a rate of approximately 1.5 percent a year], which was largely attributed to an increase of globalocean evaporation (768 km^3W25;y^2). Sustained growth of these flux rates into long-term trends would provide evidence for increasing intensity of the hydrologic cycle.' A graph of this increase can be seen below[4][5]: The data that clouds give us is more difficult to understand. You'd think that more evaporation would entail there being more clouds, but this isn't necessarily true. The way clouds work is much more complicated than that. In addition, you have to contend with the feedbacks that clouds cause.What is the evidence that the acceleration of the water cycle is due to global warming? Well, warmer air holds more moisture. We'd expect precipitation increases to follow the change in the temperature of the atmosphere. 'While a statistical analysis of course cannot provide direct physical cause-effect relations, the scientists compared their findings to existing knowledge about how much more water can be stored in the atmosphere when temperatures rise, as given by the well-known Clausius-Clapeyron equation. This additional moisture can be released during short-term heavy rainfall events. The scientists show that the observed increase in unprecedented heavy rainfall events generally fits with this thermodynamically expected increase under global warming.'[2]Overall, the significant acceleration of the water cycle is unlikely to be due to any natural variation of the climate, nor is it likely to just be a statistical anomoly. The theory behind anthropogenic global warming clearly explains why the water cycle is accelerating, as a warmer atmosphere would evaporate water faster and would be able to hold more of that water vapor.ConclusionOverall, the water cycle involves evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and runoff. I've shown that evaporation (in the form of humidity), precipitation, and runoff have all increased, and this is most likely due to global warming, due to the connection between warming and the acceleration of the water cycle.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank medv4380 for presenting his rebuttals.If I'm reading my opponent's argument correctly, he seems to be arguing that solar activity is the cause of the evaporation increase, saying that the reduction in solar activity causes the Earth's magnetic field to weaken, causing more radiation to reach Earth. However, if this is indeed his case, it has two problems. One, it posits that the strength of the Earth's magnetic field is determined by solar activity, and that there is a correlation between magnetic field strength and water cycle strength.Earth's magnetic field originates from moving charged particles at its core. 'Magnetic fields are produced by the motion of electrical charges. For example, the magnetic field of a bar magnet results from the motion of negatively charged electrons in the magnet. The origin of the Earth's magnetic field is not completely understood, but is thought to be associated with electrical currents produced by the coupling of convective effects and rotation in the spinning liquid metallic outer core of iron and nickel. This mechanism is termed the dynamo effect.' Thus, it seems that solar activity has nothing to do with the strength of the Earth's magnetic field. A decline in solar activity then would not cause the water cycle to accelerate. But there's still the problem of whether magnetic field strength has any effect on the temperature. Below are three graphs - one of the Earth's magnetic dipole moment (a measure of how strong the Earth's magnetic field is), one of solar irradiance (a measure of solar activity), and one of a measure of precipitation levels.s://www.ipcc.ch...; alt='Figure TS.10' /gt;[2][3][4]As you can see, it doesn't appear that Eaerth's magnetic field strength correlates with solar activity. In fact, just purely looking at the data, it appears that the opposite is true - increased solar irradiance decreases Earth's magnetic field strength, not decreased solar irradiance. As for the magnetic field strength/precipitation correlation, the question is a bit more complicated. Unfortunately, we don't have (or at least I can't find) global precipitation anomalies for more than 100 years. However, there's two things I'd like to note. One, if precipitation was really affected by magnetic field strength due to the amount of solar radiation Earth absorbs, then, since the decrease in magnetic field strength is linearly downwards, we'd expect precipitation levels to follow solar irradiance, because that also determines how much radiation the Earth receives. However, precipitation trends do not seem to follow solar irradiance (if they did, you'd expect 11-year cycles in precipitation levels). And two, you'd think that, since solar activity has been decreasing a lot lately, that precipitation levels would trend down. If the amount of radiation reaching Earth is the key here, then you'd need to consider solar irradiance and magnetic field strength together. The most you have is a 5-year trend. In the grand scheme of the 115 years this debate considers, that's a statistically insignificant trend, especially since the magnetic field strength has been declining for at least 400 years, and there don't seem to be any other precipitation/solar irradiance links for any of the other solar cycles.ConclusionI apologize if this was a bit choppy - I've had a lot do the past few days. However, I feel like I've covered the gist of it. The solar irradiance/magnetic field strength and magnetic field strength/water cycle rate correlations do not seem to exist, save for the past five years, which is statistically insignificant on climatological time scales.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank medv4380 for this debate.Dam RiversThere are three responses to this. One, human impacts only account for about half of the observed increase in river runoff. 'On average, land-use change has increased global runoff by 0.08 mm/year^2 and accounts for ~50% of the reconstructed global runoff trend over the last century.' There's still the other half that needs to be accounted for.[1]Two, CO2 also has a negative effect on river runoff. 'When allowing for the increase in foliage area that results from increasing atmospheric CO2 levels in a global vegetation model, we find a decrease in global runoff from 1901 to 1999.' This seems a bit counterintuitive. However, the increased precipitation that CO2 induced warming has caused has still had an effect on the rivers. The effect is just masked by the land-use changes and negative feedback related to plant growth. This is entirely separate from the water cycle.[1]And three, this topic has been very controversial, namely owing to different collections of data and statistical methods used with that data. However, this science is solid.HumidityActually, decreased SO2 levels would cause humidity levels to reduce. 'Trajectory studies and model simulations suggest that the SO2increase results in the formation of more sulfuric acid aerosol particles in the upper tropical troposphere. As a consequence, more ice crystals of smaller size are formed in the tropical tropopause, which are lifted into the stratosphere more readily. Our model calculations suggest that such a mechanism could increase the amount of water that entered the stratosphere in the condensed phase by up to 0.5 ppmv from 1950–2000.' While the decrease in SO2 emissions has slowed the rise in humidity levels a little, CO2 levels are still rising exponentially.[2]ConclusionOverall, this is basic physics. A warmer climate, caused by rising greenhouse gas emissions, causes more water to evaporate from the oceans, which causes more rain to fall, which causes the river runoff to increase. While we have been affecting river runoff in other ways, the underlying data is still there. My opponent has also failed to adequately refute my humidity (related to the amount of water in the atmosphere), and he has completely dropped my precipitation point. My opponent has provided a confusing, uncertain, and misguided argument himself. The evidence supports the conclusion that human induced global warming is the cause of the acceleration of the water cycle.</t>

    <t>==Nuclear energy==My second point involves Nuclear energy, which was created because of the weapons like the A-Bomb. F Nuclear energy alone is about 10.9% of the worlds energy, and growing. Not having this useful tool of the future would severely hurt our society.-Smaller foot-print It releases lower green-house gases, and is one of the safest ways of producing energy. NASA writes, 'Human-caused climate change and air pollution remain major global-scale problems and are both due mostly to fossil fuel burning. Mitigation efforts for both of these problems should be undertaken concurrently in order to maximize effectiveness. Such efforts can be accomplished largely with currently available low-carbon and carbon-free alternative energy sources like nuclear power and renewables, as well as energy efficiency improvements.'[1]NASA also caculated that nuclear power prevented an average of 64 gigatonnes of CO2-equivalent (GtCO2-eq) net GHG emissions globally between 1971-2009, preventing the harm of our atmosphere. Nuclear waste can also be easily recycled, and a company supported by Bill Gates in currently doing this.-Safer for workersNuclear energy is also much safer for workers in these nuclear plants, compared to coal mining and other fossil fuels. This graph, from NASA show my point. Mean net deaths prevented annually by nuclear power between 1971-2009 for various countries/regions.  'There is no question,' says Joseph Romm, an energy expert at the Center for American Progress in Washington DC. 'Nothing is worse than fossil fuels for killing people.' A 2002 review by the IEA put nuclear energy on top, as safest, and fossil fuels as the most harmful. Saves lives== -medicine and treatments.  Nuclear medicine uses radiation letting doctors to make a quick, accurate diagnosis of the patient's specific organs, or to treat them. Radiotherapy can be used to treat some medical conditions, especially cancer, using radiation to weaken or destroy particular targeted cells.   Tens of millions of patients are treated with nuclear medicine each year Over 10,000 hospitals worldwide use radioisotopes in medicine, and about 90% of the procedures are for diagnosis.  The most common radioisotope used in diagnosis is technetium-99, with some 30 million procedures per year.-Lives saved in WWII During world war two, the only other option for the allies to defeat imperil japan was operation olympus, and coronet. these operations would have cost about a million men for the allies and nearly twice that or more, for the united states. The A-bombs saved many lives, and gava a much needed end to world war two. </t>

    <t>Thank you Pro.   C1: Nuclear Weapons seriously threaten the human race   Nuclear weapons are so far one of the only weapons mankind has developed that could end the human race as we know it, and in fact, almost did more than once. In 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the world was close to nuclear war. Former Sec. of Defence Robert McNamara said, “We lucked out. It was luck that prevented a nuclear war. We came that close to nuclear war. Rational individuals! Kennedy was rational, Khrushchev was rational, Castro was rational. Rational individuals came that close to total destruction of their societies, and that danger exists today. The major lesson of the Cuban Missile Crisis is this: the indefinite combination of human fallibility and nuclear weapons will destroy nations!” Almost no other weapon besides perhaps chemical warfare has the kind of domino effect that nuclear weapons has. If one is launched, many will be launched. All it takes is the wrong leader with the right capability. A nation like North Korea, or Pakistan, or even Israel. If 100 small, regional nuclear devices were detonated, we would lose 20-50% of the ozone, followed by a brutal nuclear winter – difficult to survive. If a proper nuclear war occurred, with a real arsenal being launched, we could expect to see the extinction of the human race – a terrible nuclear winter, crippling UV damage, rapid cooling down -30 degrees Celsius, not to mention the primary effects of the weapons themselves. Bombs made fifty years ago were so powerful they could ‘scorch earth’ nine miles of land above ground and penetrate 230 m underground. When the Soviet Union tested the nuke ‘Tsar Bomba’ almost sixty years ago the resulting explosion was so powerful it blew a 5 mile fireball followed by a 35 mile high mushroom cloud that burst past the stratosphere into the mesosphere. This was 54 years ago, and that explosion blew the windows in houses 125 miles away and caused a 5.5 earthquake. Let’s not even imagine what kind of weapons we must have today. </t>

    <t>Opening Statement- I would like to think my opponent for joining and debating important issues of America. Now little about myself I'm a moderate Republican/independent living in a medium-size town of Joplin Missouri I'm here to change America to the right direction that we need or else we will never seen it again let's make America stronger.  Jobs/economy-I will start off talking about Jobs and the economy. Over 25 million people in America are unemployed because of this presidents failed policies what we need to do is Cut taxes on the middle class so businesses can stay open and others can start a business without worring about the high taxes they have to pay. As president I would do everything in my power to lower taxes to a reasonable point.  Environment-I support oil drilling because we really need the oil, but for nuclear plants we need to shut them down because there to much pollution in the air our oxygen is running out little by little and we need to stop it before it's to late climate change is growing rapidly the Midwest is getting crushed with rain and the west coast is suffering a severe drought so we need to stop this before it is to late.  Abortion- I believe that birth starts from concaseption I support abortion for rape and life endangerment of mother Otherwise abortion is murder even if you don't have money to take care of it ask a relative or put it up for adoption.  Gay Marriage- I support gay marriage all the way marriage is a bond between a couple and that means two people. You have the right to marry and love who you want and there should be respect for them. We have so many our issues to worry about then a persons love life you marry who they want they marry who they want.  Foreign policy- I believe we need to keep our relationships with other countries as good as possible. We need a border wall down by the Mexican boarder because illegals are coming in and taking our jobs we need to end this now  Thank you.</t>

    <t>IntroductionWelcome. As debate over the Trans-Pacific Partnership heats up, questions about the benefits and drawbacks of free trade are being raised by people from all sides of the political spectrum.This debate will not be a defense of the TPP, as I do not know the full details of the bill. Instead, this debate will focus purely on the concept of free trade, and how it effects the US economy. I am an avid support of free trade, and I think it is extremely beneficial to both our country and the countries we trade with. Prerequisites To be eligibile to debate this, you must have a minimum of 3 debates voted on and an elo of 2000. Also, you must make sure that there are no things in your schedule that would potentially prevent you from completing every round. These are very lenient requirements intended to reduce the chance of forfeited rounds,Debate Structure The debate will have 4 rounds, a 72 hour window to respond per round, and a 10,000 character limit.The burden of proof is shared. Con is requried to show that free trade is a net harm to the country, and I am required to show that free trade is a net benefit to the country. Whoever best meets their burden of proof should be voted the winner of this debate.

    <t>The trade regulations I advocate are targeted towards specific problems with unfettered free trade. I don't argue massive tariffs on every industry. To the extent that Pro's rebuttals attack wholesale protectionism, they simply miss their mark.SurvivalPro admits that we must drastically reduce carbon emissions to save our planet. Pro admits that we must do this now before it's too late. And Pro admits that global warming is an externality. Yet instead of *internalizing* global warming, Pro says we're better off leaving our survival to the chance that the market will reduce emissions on its own.Pro fails to realize that free trade is driven solely by prices, and if prices don't account for the harmful effects of carbon emissions, there's no incentive to reduce carbon emissions. In fact, the opposite happens: carbon emissions increase as a way to grab a cost advantage. Carbon emissions have increased every single year over the past 30 years as we've liberalized trade. We need to change that now. And the change can't be incremental. We need to lower emissions by at least 8-10%  per year to ensure our survival. [23] Free markets alone can't effect that kind of change.Pro dismisses my arguments because they lacked any sources. But not all arguments require sources. Mine doesn't. The argument I made is analytic, not empirical. But experience proves me right.Pro also cites two sources. They don't help.The first source 'estimates' that a 1% increase in sulfur dioxide output from free trade leads to a decrease in sulfur dioxide concentration of around .8%. The estimation is based on a limited theoretic framework and limited empirical data (since it doesn't look at actual free trade). It's also totally irrelevant because it dealt with sulfur dioxide. The source even notes that limitation explicitly: 'Free trade appears to lower sulfur dioxide concentrations for an average country in our sample, but may of course worsen the environment through other channels. Our evidence is specific to sulfur dioxide.' The issue in this debate is reducing carbon dioxide, not sulfur dioxide. Carbon emissions are an entirely different ballpark. The regulations that affect carbon are completely different than the regulations that affect sulfur emissions. Also, note that Pro's source actually finds an increase in pollution output. It's the increase in output that also leads to a decrease in concentration. This is very limited evidence compared to the huge number of studies showing harm to the environment from free trade: [18] [19] [20] [21] [22]  Pro's second source supports my argument, not Pro's. It states: 'Current actions are not enough if we are to stabilize greenhouse gases (GHGs) at any acceptable level. The economic challenges are complex and will require a long-term international collaboration to tackle them.' Acknowleding that 'no [trade] measures for climate change are in use anywhere in the world,' it finds that 'theoretical analysis points to a role for trade restrictions.' In fact, Pro completely distorts his source's findings. Pro fails to mention that we're talking about liberalizing trade in renewables while maintaining tariffs on fossil fuels. The study finds, just as I suggested in R2, that taxing carbon-intensive industries while liberalizing trade in renewables leads to increased use of renewables, which in turn leads to a reduction in emissions. This is precisely what I suggested would happen with a tariff targeted specifically at fossil fuels.  Pro argues that 'tariffs would lead to an inefficient allocation of resources due to the loss of comparative advantage.' But inefficiency is a better outcome than human extinction. And again, Pro's argument relies on the theory of 'comparative advantage,' which is wrong (see R2). Pro dropped that, or apparently deferred his response.Pro says 'losing efficiency means more waste and higher emissions from inefficient production.' This is untrue. First, Pro offers no evidence that 'inefficient allocation' leads to 'inefficient production.' On the contrary, as Pro's second source suggests, targeted tariffs and subsidies can increase efficient production and reduce emissions by encouraging efficient clean energy. Second, 'waste' refers to an economic loss, not to an environmental harm. Don't let Pro muddle this this issue: we're weighing potential economic growth against certain extinction of our species. Given our looming planetary ecological catastrophe, it's clear that environmental protections are necessary even at the cost of degrowth. Which isn't to say there's any degrowth; I'm just emphasizing the importance of collapse of reducing emissions.  SustainabilityPro argues that there's no link between free trade and our international investment position. But that is simply untrue. Free trade *allows* deficit trading, which is directly related to a country's international investment position. An international investment position is a statement of a country's foreign assets and debts. Free trade creates foreign debts via trade deficits.Pro completely drops my impacts. The results of deficit trading are disastrous for our economy. If there are any economic benefits to free trade, they're completely outweighed by the harms from deficit trading.Trade regulations can bring our trade closer into balance. Warren Buffet suggested one solution: give exporters $1 certificates for every dollar they export, and then require that importers buy a certificate for every dollar of goods they import. This would immediately bring our trade into balance.Pro broadly asserts that all trade regulations hurt the economy. But Pro offers no substantiation for this assertion. I've explained how trade deficits weaken our economy. Pro hasn't argued otherwise.Smoot-Hawley is irrelevant. I'm don't argue for Smoot-Hawley or anything even remotely similar. I support initiatives that bring our trade closer to balance, not drastic increases on tariffs for all industries. Pro's attack on Smoot-Hawley is a strawman and a red herring.InequalityPro admits that free trade increases inequality. Pro also drops all the impacts of inequality. Those impacts include more mental illness, drug abuse, obesity, teenage pregnancy, crime, violence, lower life expectancy, harm to trust and community life, harm to overall child well-being, and unsurprisingly, harm to the economy.Remarkably, Pro nonetheless asserts without any substantiation that economic growth from free trade outweighs all these social harms. I have two responses. First, the impact from an increase in GDP simply cannot outweigh these harms. Pro doesn't even tell us what the impact is. Growth has little if any positive impact. It simply means more wealth. It doesn't tell us who possesses that wealth. Nor does it tell us if more wealth is good for those people.What are they buying with that money? In the US, only a tiny proportion of production and human labor is devoted to actual human needs as opposed to market-generated wants. Over a trillion dollars is spent every year on marketing. More growth means more marketing, more market-generated wants, and more consumption of stuff we don't need. More growth doesn't mean more food, clothing, shelter, health care, education, or public transportation. More growth doesn't mean a cleaner environment. More growth doesn't mean less poverty or inequality. And most importantly, more growth doesn't mean more happiness. Research has found 'no trace of a relationship between income and happiness.' In fact, studies suggest that 'wealth may undermine people's ability to savor positive events.' [17] In other words, the rich may experience less happiness because awesome things like caviar and champagne become a regular experience instead of something to appreciate and savor. Accumulating wealth for its own sake might even be net harmful.Second, Pro fails to address my point that inequality slows economic growth. Pro hasn't offered a single reason to believe that growth from free trade outweighs degrowth from inequality. Pro's source, an article by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, offers no substantiation for its assertions. The article doesn't explain how free trade leads to job growth. It simply assert that free trade increases GDP based on an observed GDP increase. But there's no analysis as to what caused the GDP increase; it could have been any number of things besides free trade. And even if GDP increases, it doesn't mean the benefits pass onto most Americans. Most Americans work blue-collar jobs and are thus left unemployed by free trade. Then, they end up less happy because of greater inequality, and end up being at higher risk for mental illness, obesity, crime, and all the other impacts of inequality. To assert that an abstract quantifier like GDP outweighs all the harms from an increase in inequality simply misunderstands the nature of human well-being and happiness.RebuttalPro defers his defense of 'innovation and the gains of trade' until R4. This deprives me of a rebuttal in R3, which is both unfair and a violation of Pro's requirements in R1. With three days per round, Pro effectively gets nine days to write his defense while I only get three days to respond. Timing matters. Six extra days of research and polish increases the quality of one's arguments significantly. Pro gets an unfair structural advantage because of that. If Pro had no intention of addressing my rebuttal until R4, the debate should have been structured to limit rebuttals to R3 and R4. Instead, Pro required rebuttal in R2. Not addressing that rebuttal until R4 is abusive towards that requirement. Pro says he 'ran out of time.' But that's not an excuse. Everyone must balance time. R1 states: 'you must make sure that there are no things in your schedule that would potentially prevent you from completing every round.' Yet Pro couldn't complete his round because he 'ran out of time.' Punish him for that.Sources in the comments and reposted in R4.</t>

    <t>I'll start with my arguments and then do a rebuttal.Free trade poses an existential threat to human survival97% of climate scientists agree that humans are causing global warming. [1] Climate change harms agriculture, human health, ecosystems, water supplies, and the economy. [2] If greenhouse gas emissions continue at their current rate, we'll soon reach a tipping point, after which runaway climate change will make the planet uninhabitable to humans. [3]Free trade is incompatible with reducing emissions, slowing climate warming, and saving our planet. Under a free trade regime, prices are set solely by supply and demand, so social costs like climate change and environmental damage aren't reflected in a good's price. Economists call these unaccounted social costs an 'externality.' Free trade is driven by prices, so if prices are wrong due to externalities, free trade will produce bad outcomes.For example, transportation costs. Free trade encourages goods to be made in one place and used very far away. The transportation costs are not only a waste of energy but they also increase the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which speeds up climate change. And, not only does free trade fail to account for carbon emissions from transportation, it also fails to account for carbon emissions from harmful production facilities, as well as radioactive waste from nuclear power, or pollution from pesticides, chemicals, and heavy metals. In fact, free trade not only permits environmental damage but encourages it, as a way to grab a cost advantage.A potential solution is a small, uniform tariff for all imports. This would encourage local production, thereby avoiding an enormous amount of wasted energy in transportation. Another idea is a carbon tax; the US could penalize imports of fossil fuels and other harmful energy-intensive industries. This would help discourage greenhouse gas emissions and encourage clean production facilities and renewable energy sources.Free trade is unsustainableFree trade lets the US import more than it exports (i.e. deficit trading). To make up the difference, the US must assume debt. As a result, foreign countries own over $30 trillion in US assets, and the US net international investment position is -$5.445 trillion. [4] The harm to the economy is huge. In 2001, the Economic Strategy Institute estimated that deficit trading shaves at least one percent per year off our economic growth. [5] Economist William Bahr estimates that our trade deficit since 1991 has made our economy 13% smaller than it otherwise would be. [6] Other economists estimate that trade deficits have stunted GDP growth by up to 20%. [4] And trade deficits also destroy jobs (e.g. trade deficits with China cost the US 2.8 million jobs between 2001 and 2008). [7] Free trade increases economic inequalityThe Stolper-Samuelson theorem, an underlying mechanism of free-market economics, says that freer trade raises returns to the abundant facctor of production and lowers returns to the scarce once. [11] In the US, the abundant factor is capital and the scarce one is labor. Thus, according to the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, free trade increases economic inequality. [12] [13] The jobs that suffer most are those that are easily traded for cheap labor abroad. This primarily impacts low-skill workers, who either lose their job or get paid less. Of course, that means free trade hurts most Americans, as most American work the sorts of blue-collar jobs that are easily traded. So we're talking about a massive impact here: a minority gets richer (and these are folks who are already rich), while the vast majority gets poorer. This is unfair. Making an extra $10,000 will improve the well-being of a middle-class family more than losing $10,000 will reduce the well-being of a billionaire. Given that fact, it makes no sense to redistribute wealth to the rich through free trade. Besides, inequality contributes to mental illness, drug abuse, obesity, and teenage pregnancy. It fosters crime and vioelence. It lowers life expectancy. And it's been shown to harm trust and community life, and overall child well-being. [14] [15] This explains why the US has so many problems with drug abuse, crime, imprisonment, and obesity when compared with other countries, since the US is so unequal. There's no other explanation. And the case against economic inequality isn't just based on social impacts. New OECD analysis has found a 'negative and statistically significant correlation' between income inequality and economic growth. [16] In other words, inequality also slows economic growth.RebuttalInnovation. Pro says free trade increases innovation. But the evidence shows otherwise; free trade harms innovation. [8] Pro's argument rests on the false assumption that more competition necessarily means more innovation. But economists have found the opposite: after a certain point, more competition reduces innovation! [9] [10] Less competition means less market uncertainty, which gives companies more confidence to invest in innovative Ramp;D. Pro underestimates the role that market stability and market concentration plays in innovation. This has led economists to say that the relationship between competition and innovation is an inverted U-shape. In other words, competition only increases innovation up to a certain point, after which more competition actually harms innovation. [8] cites empirical data showing that free trade harms innovation; economic theory cited in [9] and [10] supports this result.Lower prices. Pro says free trade lowers prices. But what Pro misunderstands is that free trade affects relative prices, not the price level (the latter being affected by macro and monetary factors). Free trade lowers the relative price of imports; by necessity, the relative price of exports must go up. Thus, consumers only benefit from free trade if they buy more imports than exports. That's not something we can rely on, as many consumers prefer exported goods rather than imported goods (e.g. in Argentina, most consumers eat mostly beef, which also happens to be Argentina's biggest export). Pro's own sources clearly state their limitation to imports.Economic growth. Pro's argument rests on the mistaken theory of comparative advantage. Comparative advantage is the idea that it's beneficial to import some goods (including services) in order to free up our workforce to produce more-valuable goods instead. The theory doesn't work because it assumes workers move easily between industries. If workers can't move, imports won't push a nation's economy into industries better suited to its comparative advantage. Instead, imports will just kill off existing industries and leave nothing in its place. Many workers don't have the skills or don't live in the right place to move between industries. Free trade will leave these workers unemployed. This problem is compounded because of at-will employment and relatively low minimum wage in the US. The result is folks with PhDs in physics making minimum wage because they can't find a better job. In effect, free trade leads to both less jobs and lower wages. The human cost is obvious but there's an economic one as well: when skills that cost money to acquire (e.g. physics) aren't used, the economy loses large investments in human capital. These losses put the whole economy at risk. Nobel laureate James Tobin put it this way: 'it takes a heap of Harberger triangles to fill an Okun gap.' A Harberger triangle is the area in a supply and demand diagram that measures the loss of taxation (i.e. the benefits of free trade). An Okun gap is the loss in output and employment when the economy falls below potential. Tobin's point is that the benefits of free trade are tiny compared to the huge cost of running our economy below full capacity due to imports and lost jobs. Other benefits. Pro also lists a host of other benefits that supposedly follow from free trade. But these 'benefits' are bare assertions. Pro doesn't actually offer any evidence/argument about these benefits. There's simply no link between these 'benefits' and 'free trade.'A final point. Free trade creates win-lose situations. Consumers enjoy lower prices on imported goods, but the relative price of exports goes up. And as a result, workers lose their jobs, and get paid less. Given that consumers and workers are ultimately the same people, there's no way to determine whether these consumers/workers gain more than they lose. No theorem in economics guarantees that the gains of consumers from lower prices on imports outweighs the loss of workers (and higher prices on exports, and lower wages).</t>

    <t>'If greenhouse gas emissions continue at their current rate, we'll soon reach a tipping point, after which runaway climate change will make the planet uninhabitable to humans.'  You claim that greenhouse gas emissions usage, if continued at this rate, would like to runaway climate change that would make this planet uninhabitable. I will grant you the argument that greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to make the planet uninhabitable. I disagree with the idea that gas emissions would continue at our current rate.   Free Trade is Beneficial to the Environment  'Free trade is incompatible with reducing emissions, slowing climate warming, and saving our planet. Under a free trade regime, prices are set solely by supply and demand, so social costs like climate change and environmental damage aren't reflected in a good's price. Economists call these unaccounted social costs an 'externality.' Free trade is driven by prices, so if prices are wrong due to externalities, free trade will produce bad outcomes.'  You provide no sources that demonstrate that free trade is incompatible with reducing emissions and slowing global warming. Negative externalities do result from fossil fuel usage in the form of greenhouse gasses and pollution, but that doesn't mean artificially increasing the price of energy consumption to try to make the price 'right' would actually benefit society.   On the contrary, there is evidence that free trade actually benefits the environment. One study found that 'Our estimates of the scale and technique elasticities indicate that, if openness to international markets raises both output and income by 1 percent, pollution concentrations fall by approximately 1 percent. Putting this calculation together with our earlier evidence on composition effects yields a somewhat surprising conclusion with regard to sulfur dioxide: freer trade is good for the environment. Free trade would also benefit the environment because it facilitates the spread of more efficient and greener technologies. A World Bank study found that 'Access to climate-friendly clean energy technologies is especially important for the fast-growing developing economies. Within the context of the current global trade regime, the study finds that a removal of tariffs and NTBs for four basic clean energy technologies (wind, solar, clean coal, and efficient lighting) in 18 of the high-GHG-emitting developing countries will result in trade gains of up to 13 percent. If translated into emissions reductions, these gains suggest that—even within a small subset of clean energy technologies and for a select group of countries—the impact of trade liberalization could be reasonably substantial.' 'For example, transportation costs.'  Sure, there are transportation emissions, but the alternative is worse.   'A potential solution is a small, uniform tariff for all imports. This would encourage local production, thereby avoiding an enormous amount of wasted energy in transportation. Another idea is a carbon tax; the US could penalize imports of fossil fuels and other harmful energy-intensive industries. This would help discourage greenhouse gas emissions and encourage clean production facilities and renewable energy sources.' This proposal to reduce carbon emissions is flawed. First off, tariffs would lead to an inefficient allocation of resources in society due to the loss of comparative advantage. Losing efficiency means more waste and higher emissions from inefficient production. The carbon tax is a regressive tax that burdens poor people the most, would increase the cost of living for everyone, lead to less economic growth, and would not affect oil consumption greatly unless the tax is set enormously high, due to the inelastic demand for oil.   The better solution to facilitate the advancement of alternative energy sources is to decrease regulations that prevent business growth, increase free trade to facilitate the expansion of green technologies, and allow the free market to continue developing alternative energy sources.   Free trade is not incompatible with the reducing carbon emissions. Free trade will lead to the reduction of carbon emissions.  Free trade is Sustainable 'Free trade lets the US import more than it exports (i.e. deficit trading). To make up the difference, the US must assume debt. As a result, foreign countries own over $30 trillion in US assets, and the US net international investment position is -$5.445 trillion. [4]'   International investment isn't equivalent to free trade. Free trade is the lack of tariffs and barriers in the transaction of goods and services in the economy. Investing  involves buying and holding stocks, bonds, and mutual funds to achieve a profit later. Tariffs don't directly apply to US international investment.   But while we're on the topic of sustainability, it has been proven time and again that protectionism hurts the economy and is unsustainable.  A famous example of protectionism at work is the Smoot-Hawley Bill. The Smoot-Hawley Bill was a bill that drastically increased tariffs to try to protect American works, but it ended up backfiring and hurting out economy. 'U.S. imports from Europe declined from a 1929 high of $1,334 million to just $390 million in 1932, while U.S. exports to Europe fell from $2,341 million in 1929 to $784 million in 1932. Overall, world trade declined by some 66% between 1929 and 1934. More generally, Smoot-Hawley did nothing to foster trust and cooperation among nations in either the political or economic realm during a perilous era in international relations. Free trade increases the standards of living of the poor  'The Stolper-Samuelson theorem, an underlying mechanism of free-market economics, says that freer trade raises returns to the abundant facctor of production and lowers returns to the scarce once. [11] In the US, the abundant factor is capital and the scarce one is labor. Thus, according to the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, free trade increases economic inequality. [12] [13] The jobs that suffer most are those that are easily traded for cheap labor abroad. This primarily impacts low-skill workers, who either lose their job or get paid less. Of course, that means free trade hurts most Americans, as most American work the sorts of blue-collar jobs that are easily traded. So we're talking about a massive impact here: a minority gets richer (and these are folks who are already rich), while the vast majority gets poorer. ' Free trade has overall helped poor Americans. Yes, some types of jobs have been lost, but overall poor Americans are better off with free trade than without.   One example is how free trade helps job growth. The Heritage Foundation found that, 'Today, the $12 trillion U.S. economy is bolstered by free Trade, a pillar of America's vitality. In 2005, U.S. exports to the rest of the world totaled $1.2 trillion and supported one in five U.S. manufacturing jobs. jobs directly linked to the export of goods pay 13 percent to 18 percent more than other U.S. jobs.' Also, 'The average U.S. tariff rate on all goods has fallen from over 19 percent in 1933 to 1.8 percent in 2004. As a percentage of GDP, the importance of Trade in the economy has climbed from single digits in the 1930s to nearly one-quarter of U.S. GDP in 2004. At the same time that Trade has become freer, real per capita GDP in the U.S. (in constant 2000 dollars) has climbed from a low of $5,061 in 1933 to about $36,000 in 2004.'  Average wages have substantially increased for every single income percentile since the start of trade liberalization. Economic inequality may have increased over time, but the free market isn't a zero-sum game. Free trade benefits every that takes part in the market, rich or poor. I'd rather have economic inequality and increased standards of living for the poor, than having everyone be more equal, but poorer. As I have ran out of time, I will be discussing and defending my arguments for innovation and the gains of trade next round.</t>

    <t>Free Trade Increases Innovation and Efficiency The first reason one should support free trade is because open trade with other countries leads to maximized innovation and efficiency in the economy.  The reason why there is more innovation in a free market is because businesses are forced to compete against each other on an equal playing field, which means they have to come up with ways to outcompete their competition. This results in businesses and individuals creating and employing new ideas to decrease their expenses (such as replacing a component of a machine with a cheaper material), increase the quality of their goods/services (such as making a food product taste better), and create more efficient methods to create and employ the goods/services (such as making an efficient website to ease purchases of a product).     Free Trade Lowers the Cost of Goods and Services  One of the best reasons to support free trade is the fact that it lowers the cost of  living for everyone. This happens because of the competition that I mentioned above. When companies compete without the distortion of tariffs, they are forced to provide the cheapest price possible in order to remain competitive and generate revenue.   For proof, we can look at multiple studies that prove this to be true. One study found that 'the results of a panel covering 325 manufacturing industries from 1997 to 2006 show that imports from nine low-wage countries are associated with strong downward pressure on prices. When these nations capture a 1% share of the U.S. sector, the sector's producer prices decrease by 2.35%' (1)  The graph below shows how imports effect the US methanol market. (2)Free Trade Leads to Economic Growth  The term used to describe the efficiency increases as a result of free trade is called the gains of trade. Below is a graph to help visualize how the gains of trade works.(3)Or another way to look at it, one can analyze how tariffs effect the supply of a product in the graph below.(4) Other Benefits Other benefits of Free trade include: (5)  Enhances the domestic competitiveness Takes advantage of international trade technology Increase sales and profits Extend sales potential of the existing products Maintain cost competitiveness in your domestic market Enhance potential for expansion of your business Gains a global market share Reduce dependence on existing markets Stabilize seasonal market fluctuations. </t>

Charity has been widly ineffective in producing happiness in the third world. Hunger still exists, rape still exists, choclate salty candy balls are still not in the mouths of children. There are an limited amount of resources by definition charity can only help for a short time. They are prolonging the deaths of children. It is better to leave them alone and allow them develope or die on their own like evolution demands. Giving the monei to bethesda to develop fallout 4 more developlly will be better use of charity money. If you play video games it will cause very much happiness more than any child would get. These african  and cancer children wait for some aspect of hope where none will likely to be found but they can know FO4 already exists! Fallout 4 can release violant and sexual hangups that all gamers have with the violanet and sexual nature of the game. Food or cancer resarch only causes happiness for a few moments only to worry about more funding and sh1t. Fallout has so much replayability and if Bethesda releases new content each mounth the game can NEVER be completed. This will insure extreeme happiness forever.If you dont play video games, than you can learn or watch people play it on the jewtubes. It can also realse sexual hangups with vault girl cosplays. With enough money going to PR tons of women that look like her will dress similar further leading to increased happiness and libedo of the male race. Ultilmatly causing more children to be born to make more FO4 content. Charity can do none of this2: culture amp; sh1tFFallout is a game bout war and necular war. seeing the world like this will cause fauture generations (caused by sexy vault girls (see above)) to not want war. They wont want to look at ugly ghouls or huge azz super mutants, they will cheresh the world today. This will cause climate change to be elimated, everyone will be too bsusy playing fallout to make any more global warming. and by teaching an apprechastion of the world will cause people to strive for an elimnation of climate change. With everyone playing fallout to get rid of sexual and violent hangups, there will therefore be no violence or rape. Unwanted pregniences will go down and wanted pregniacnies will go up. Drug addicts can cure their addiction by taking drugs on the video game relasing there urge to shoot up (or huff up jet).when mod tools are relased people will become smarter because they want to make mods to add beards, hair, beards, giant penises, and more weapons in the game. Theyll have to learn how to animate textures, and create texutres. creating a smart computer literate people who know their sh1t .This will create jobs for a megaton of people. Bethesda will have to hire millions of emploies to expand on the market. Everyone will already have qualifications3: World peaceWith everyone united by fallout 4, all the poor, sick, and hungery dead this will allow first world nations to expand and take over the countires that were home to the weak.This will create a better use for the land. Everone speaks the same laungage fallout 4 and this unites people into creating a one world government with world peace in mind. All first world nations have common ground a love of FO4 and wish to avoid what happened in fallout. Ambitions will be to help future generations, to expand our minds and fallout 4. Develope flying ships like the one in the fallout trailer to develope technology similar to fallout's and to finially achive space travel in case all else fails. With the future in mind men will finillay reach the stars and create a galatic empire.All thats required is to stop giving money tf*cking charites and start giving it to bethesda</t>

    <t>Pro is obviously trolling, but since it wasn't clarified that this was a troll debate then I have no choice but to take this seriously. On that note, let's examine Pro's case. It is filled with bare assertion fallacies, non-sequiturs and personal bias that in no way actually fulfills the BoP that Pro holds.Happiness1. Pro claims that charity has been wildly ineffective. However, his reasoning for this isn't sufficient. Of course there is still hunger and crime existent, but charity work has reduced that and has helped the cause by showing. Bill Gates, founder of an effective world charity, dispels the myth that foreign aid is a big waste. He states that because of help from other countries, 'by 2035, there will be almost no poor countries left in the world.' He gives examples of how foreign has benefited third-world countries such as that a vaccine campaign in southern Africa eliminated measles as a killer of children. Polio has been mostly wiped from the world and is only prevalent in the countries of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria.[1]2. The assertion that video games cause happiness is both subjective and unfounded. Most hildren in Africa don't even have access game consoles, and there's no way to determine that they would become 'happier' from playing it versus being cured of malaria and taken out of poverty which charity is working to do.3. Fallout 4 has not even been released yet, so it is complete speculation to say it will cause happiness. It's release date is thought to be sometime in November 2015 Culture1. Just because Fallout 4 is supposedly about nuclear war doesn't mean future generations will dislike war in the future....again, unfounded assumption and complete lack of evidence.2. Not everyone will be 'too busy' to cause climate change because we don't know how many people will abandon their important jobs to play the game. It could be a huge failure for all we know.3. Violence and unwanted pregnancies aren't going to decrease. Not everyone will be playing it, and we certainly don't know how many will. Same reasoning as above.4. Mod tools do not increase intelligence. Unsubstantiated claim.5. Jobs may or may not be created. No way to know for sure, and even if there is it cannot compare to charity work.World peace1. Pro asserts that everyone will be united by Fallout 4 but this argument is completely theoretical. Pro is wishing this would happen, but gives no reason for us to believe that it actually will.2. The rest of this argument is so ridiculous it's not worthy of a response. Everything Pro says will happen is 100% unsupported, thus should be dismissed.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank Kryptic for accepting this debate.Correlation and CausationConsider the Cenozoic era (the last 65 million years). Overall, solar activity increased 0.4% over this period. 'Because Earth absorbs about 240 W/m^2 of solar energy, that brightness increase is a forcing of about 1 W/m^2. This small linear increase of forcing, by itself, would have caused a modest global warming through the Cenozoic Era.' The CO2 levels caused a much higher forcing. In contrast, atmospheric CO2 during the Cenozoic changed from at least 1000 ppm in the early Cenozoic to as small as 170 ppm during recent ice ages. The resulting climate forcing, as can be computed accurately for this CO2 range using formulae in Table 1 of Hansen et al. (2000), exceeds 10 W/m^2. It is clear that CO2 was the dominant climate forcing in the Cenozoic.'[1]In fact, the temperature changes correspond to the CO2 changes. '...there is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr.'[2]This graph shows the CO2-temperature correlation over the last 700,000 years: Excess CO2 traps heat. Considering the recent global warming, satellites measure less heat escaping out to space, at the particular wavelengths that CO2 absorbs heat, thus finding '...direct experimental evidence for a significant increase in the Earth's greenhouse effect.' In other words, the Earth is retaining more of the heat that it receives from the sun that it received from before. This excess heat manifests itself through global temperature increases.'If less heat is escaping to space, where is it going? Back to the Earth's surface. Surface measurements confirm this, observing more downward infrared radiation. A closer look at the downward radiation finds moreheat returning at CO2 wavelengths,leadin to the conclusion that '...this experimental data should effectively end the argument by skeptics that no experimental evidence exists for the connection between greenhouse gas increases in the atmosphere and global warming.''[3][4][5]Evidence of Mankind's Influence on the Recent Global Warming TrendIt would be rather coincidental if the recent rise in global warming happened to start just around the time that humans started to emit large quantities of greenhouse gases. However, there is direct evidence as well, in addition to the already established correlation between temperature and CO2.Now, it is known that CO2 levels are increasing. 'In pre-industrial times over the last 10,000 years, CO2 was relatively stable at around 275 to 285 parts per million. Over the last 250 years, atmospheric CO2 levels have increased by about 100 parts per million.' CO2 levels are increasing at a level not seen in at least 500,000 years, if not longer.[6]Here is a graph showing CO2 concentrations over the last 10000 years: [7][8]Now, carbon has several isotopes, three of which are C12, C13, and C14. C14 is radioactive, and has a half life of around 5,730 years. The CO2 emissions that humans make come from fossil fuels. Thus, if humans were the cause of the excess CO2, we'd except the C14/C12 ratio to decline, because, while there is a relatively constant amount of C14 in the atmosphere due to continuous replenishment (when a neutron collides with a regular nitrogen atom, a C14 atom and a proton result), the amount of C14 in the Earth has steadily decreased because it is not replenished, and since fossil fuels come from the ground, almost pure C12 is being ejected into the atmosphere. Indeed, it is observed that the C14/C12 ratio has declined. And thus, if humans were the cause of the excess CO2, we'd except the C13/C12 ratio to decline, because plants find it easier to take in carbon dioxide with a C12 atom than one with a C13 atom, implying that plants have a lower C13/C12 ratio than the atmopshere and, since animals eat plants (either by directly eating then or eating something that eats plants), also implying that fossils also have a lower C13/C12 ratio than the atmopshere, implying that we'd see a decline in the C13/C12 ratio as well. Indeed it is also observed that the C13/C12 ratio has declined.[9][10][11]This can be observed in the graph below (this is the C13/C12 ratio over the last 650 years; the C14/C12 ratio graph was too big to put in the debate):The evidence that this excess CO2 is the cause of the recent global warming is voluminous. One piece of evidence is a comparison of warming in the troposphere and stratosphere. Because the CO2 is in the upper troposphere, the troposphere temperature would increase, while the stratospheric temperature would decrease, because there would be less heat reaching the stratosphere. 'Computer model estimates of the ‘human influence’ fingerprint are broadly similar to the observed pattern. In sharp contrast, model simulations of internal and total natural variability cannot produce the same sustained, large-scale warming of the troposphere and cooling of the stratosphere.'[4][12][13]This graph shows this: [4]Another piece of evidence is the frequency of cold days and nights. Because the sun only shines in the day time, is the sun was causing global warming, the days would warm faster than the nights, while if greenhouse gases were causing global warming, this wouldn't be observed. It is the latter's prediction that is observed. 'What we observe is a decrease in cold nights greater than the decrease in cold days, and an increase in warm nights greater than the increase in warm days.'[4][14]This can be shown in the below graph: [4]Overall, the evidence shows that human-emitted greenhouse gases are the cause of global warming. CO2, in addition to other gases like methane and nitrous oxide are being emitted by humans in very large amounts, and this is manifesting itself in an increase in the average global temperature.Climate Sensitivity and FeedbacksClimate sensitivity is the amount the temperature would rise if the CO2 concentration were doubled. Obviously, if there's a large climate sensitivity, then increases in CO2 have large effect. It is known that the climate sensitivity is around 1 degree C. However, this can be amplified through feedbacks. Positive ones amplify the sensitivity, while negative ones diminish the sensitivity. The evidence overwhelmingly comes down on the former, that positive feedbacks are happening. Increases in CO2 cause temperature increases, which are amplified by water vapor and the effect on clouds.'Since the radiative effects associated with the buildup of water vapor to near-saturation levels and the subsequent condensation into clouds are far stronger than the equilibrium level of radiative forcing by the non-condensing GHGs, this results in large local fluctuations in temperature about the global equilibrium value.'[15]This can be shown in the below graph: Further, increases in CO2 affect the carbon cycle in this way:Global warming can result in the death of vegetation (due to droughts) and the warming of the ocean. Both of these further reduce the maximum absorption of the Earths carbon cycle, thus resulting in even more CO2 being released into the atmosphere. And with this, CO2 increases even more. In other words, CO2-caused temperature increases are amplified by positive feedbacks and the mechanics of the carbon cycle.So, the positive feedback amplifies the climate sensitivity. How much it is amplified can be determined through study. Using a Bayesian statistical approach, which is “the dominant [method] in the literature”, these findings support the notion of climate sensitivity as maximum 4 degrees C, a mean of 3 degrees C, and likely not lower than 3 degrees.[16]The graph below gives a statistical analysis:[17]The mean is around 3 degrees C. The CO2 that humans emit thus has an effect of 3 degrees C per doubling of CO2. This can be shown by the fact that CO2 concentrations have increased from around 275 ppm to around 400 ppm. This is an increase of around 40%. This should manifest itself with a temperature increase of a little less than 1.5 degrees C. Indeed, temperatures have increased around this amount over the last 150 years. The anthropogenic-forcing climate models thus match observations.[18]In other words, in addition to the direct evidence of how the Earth is warming, the climate models based on a greenhouse gas cause to global warming explain almost perfectly the recent global warming. This is a lot of evidence for a human case to the recent global warming.ConclusionGreenhouse gases cause global warming because of their heat trapping abilities. Humans have been emitting vast amounts of greenhouse gases over the last 150 years, and this shows itself on the CO2 measurements. The atmospheric warming pattern and greater heating at night are evidence that the recent global warming is caused by those human emitted greenhouse gases. These increases are amplified through the water vapor and cloud positive feedbacks and the positive feedback that arises through the climate cycle. The climate sensitivity ends up being around 3 degrees C. Finally, the CO2-temperature record shows that the two correlate with remarkable correlation.SourcesSources in comments.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank Kryptic for presenting his argument.I agree with the alternate definition he provided. Looking back to the definition I cited in round 1, I defined global warming as '...the average temperature of Earth's atmosphere and oceans since the late 19th century, and its projected continuation.' This means that any arguments regarding natural factors' effects on the climate before the late 19th century and long term climate projection of there being another ice age are irrelevant. I'm not contending that natural factors have no effect on the climate, or even that they are not usually the only cause of climate change. All I'm arguing is that the global warming since the late 19th century has been driven mostly by anthropogenic forcings.[1]Since my opponent provided no other arguments, all I will do in this round is show how comparing natural factors and anthropogenic factors shows that humans are the main cause of global warming.The most important of the natural climate forcings is the sun. It is the source of the Earth's energy. This energy comes from the radiation emitted as a result of fusion reactions at the core of the sun. This radiation is known as the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI). Any change in the TSI causes energy imbalances on the Earth. This energy imbalance can be calculated using the formula below:Delta means change, so Delta(F) means the change in energy (i.e. energy imbalance) and Delta(TSI) means the change in solar irradiance. The 0.7 factor comes from the fact that the Earth reflects about 30% of the solar radiation it receives, and the 1/4 factor comes from spherical geometry.Changes in temperature are proportional to the energy imbalance. This can be expressed in the formula below:Lambda is the constant of proportionality, representing the climate sensitivity (discussed in my first argument) in this case.The only thing that's left is to actually determine the values. First, the change in TSI (in this case, between 1900 and 1950). 'Although Wang, Lean, and Sheeley's reconstructionputs the change in TSIsince 1900 at about 0.5 W-m-2, previous studies have shown a larger change, so we'll estimate the change in TSI at 0.5 to 2 W-m-2.' This corresponds to an energy imbalance of around 0.1-0.35 W-m-2. Next, the lambda factor. I explained in the last article that the statistically most probable value for the climate sensitivity was around 3 degrees C. But, there was a lot of variation. 'Studies have given a possible range of values of 2 to 4.5°C warming for a doubling of CO2, which corresponds to a range of 0.54 to 1.2°C/(W-m-2) for λ.' This gives range of values from 0.05 to 0.4 degrees C, with a most probable value of 0.15 degrees C (corresponding to the statistically most likely climate sensitivity). In other words, solar activity from 1900 to 1950 raised the temperature of the Earth 0.15 degrees C.[2]Looking at the effect of CO2 emissions over that same period, humans increased the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere by about 20 parts per million, giving a range of values of 0.14-0.32 degrees C for the effect of that emission on the climate, with the most probable being 0.22 degrees C.[2]This corresponds to CO2 amounting for 60% of the warming from 1900-1950. After that, it gets higher. CO2 emissions rise exponentally, and changes in the TSI start getting less positive, and eventually become negative after 1975. 'Therefore, the solar forcing combined with theanthropogenicCO2forcing and other minor forcings (such as decreased volcanic activity) can account for the 0.4°C warming in the early 20th century, with the solar forcing accounting for about 40% of the total warming. Over the past century, this increase inTSIis responsible for about 15-20% of global warming. But sinceTSIhasn't increased in at least the past 32 years (and more like 60 years, based onreconstructions), the Sun is not directly responsible for the warming over that period.' Solar activity cannot account for the warming after 1975, and even before that was a smaller factor than CO2.[2]This can be shown in the image below:[3]CO2 correlates with CO2 more than solar activity, especially after 1975.There are other natural forcings, ozone concentrations and volcanic activity being the other major ones. The ozone layer of the atmosphere blocks the sun's UV radiation from reaching the Earth. Lowering levels of ozone may cause warming then by allowing more solar radiation to reach the Earth. However, while ozone levels were decreasing before 1995, they are now increasing (regardless, the declining ozone levels were also caused by humans). And the volcanic activity forcing has actually had a cooling effect on the climate. 'Foster and Rahmstorf (2011) used a multiple linear regression approach to filter out the effects of volcanic andsolar activity, and the El NiñoSouthern Oscillation(ENSO). They found that volcanic activity, as measured by aerosol optical thickness data (AOD) has only caused between 0.02 and 0.04°C per decade warming from 1979 through 2010 (Table 1, Figure 2), or about 0.06 to 0.12°C warming of the surface and lowertroposphere, repsectively, since 1979 (out of approximately 0.5°C observed surface warming).'[4]In total, all the forcings, both natural and anthropogenic, can be shown below:[3]Greenhouse gases are far more important than solar activity (note that sulfate levels mostly correlate with volcanic activity).ConclusionI don't have anything more to say, since this is all my opponent talks about. Anthropogenic forcings were more important for global warming than natural forcings. </t>
<h> Looking at the effect of CO2 emissions over that same period, humans increased the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere by about 20 parts per million, giving a range of values of 0.14-0.32 degrees C for the effect of that emission on the climate.</h>

    <t>I will be debating against (Con) the idea that 'Mankind Is the Main Cause of Global Warming', I do not doubt that we are a huge factor in this, however I am arguing that we are not the leading cause of Global Warming, or known better recently as, Climate Change.I would like to start talking about what Climate Change is.- a change in global or regional climate patterns, in particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onwards and attributed largely to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels.This is the typical definition of Climate Change for the public, the use of fossil fuels and other carbon based structures that inevitably end up in the atmosphere, making a greenhouse effect and holding in more heat. My argument is, ~ Humans and natural cycles is why we have Climate Change ~Each year through our generation of electricity through coal [4], our consumption of petrol and oil and exhaust of our transportation [3], our destruction of natural filters such as plant life, phytoplankton [1] and bodies of water [2] have made our world a slightly different place that will radically change in the near future.The science behind the principle of Climate Change is what we want to know. How does Climate Change work?If we look at the moon, the temperatures vary from -170C to 100C [5], however, on Earth we have a stronger gravity, this pulls our gaseous atmosphere closer to our planet through its mass. Gravity is a force and puts pressure on everything it can affect, as a result, everything becomes heavier; this means that the centrifugal force also applies more pressure due to the rotation of the axis [6]. Since our atmosphere is a lot closer and denser then the moons atmosphere, heat is locked in.The question now is, how the atmosphere correlates to increased heat. In order for our atmosphere to absorb radiation, it must have some electrically charged particles for passing electromagnetic waves to push around. Although most of the gasses in our atmosphere don't have a negative charge, instead, they have an equal distribution between both negative and positive charges. However, there is one good part about the placement of polarity, Water (H20), Ozone (O3) and Nitrous Oxide (N2O) which all have their negatively charged particles on one side allowing infrared radiation to absorb and reflect easily.[7]Carbon Dioxide (C02) and Methane (CH4) move and shake continuously allowing the same result as the previous three elements. [8]As a result, having these gasses enables more heat to be held together leading to hotter days. I will not be going into Ozone Depletion however I will be going into how the real reason we have climate change is due to our oceans.Opening statement.The human use of elements that promote the greenhouse effect on the world has created a slight discourse in the typical cycles that would otherwise naturally occur. The waters are getting hotter, rising, and expelling carbon dioxide instead of holding it in, this has occurred in the past naturally without human intervention, the natural filters are being removed and as a result, more carbon dioxide is entering our atmosphere enabling Climate Change. This is the man made climate change that will affect the patterns of temperature cycles that have been happening for the last 4.5 billion years. Mankind is affecting the part of repair or restoration within natural filters. If we look at graphs that are 542 million years ago, we can see a general pattern, we are about to go into a cold spell soon too. The next ice age is on its way. Currently I have no option to upload the graph so I will post it in the reference. I do apologise for my incredibly short argument, it’s really late, and I did not have much time to work on this. I will finish my argument, address your rebuttals and complete round 2 and 3 off successfully in the next round. Thank you.Kryptic.</t>

Even though he claims 'gt;R1 established 'global warming' (synonomous to 'climate change' in the literature) ', climate change and global warming are completely different, the Little Ice age was an example of climate change but not global warming. Not all change = warming. 16k thinks climate change = global warming because global warming is an example of climate change and they are therefore the same. That would be like saying because all squares= rectangles are rectangles = squares.  7. No semantics; debaters will adhere to the common/average understanding of the topic  The common understanding of climate change is changes in the climate, not necessarily warming. The definition of origin is 'the point or place where something begins, arises, or is derived. (google)', which basically means beginning of something, which means the start. The start of CLIMATE CHANGE dated back to millions of years ago.  'Con's debate strategy is immoral, unfair, and rule breaking. '  To what morality system? Back up your assertions. Unfair? Well you instigated it and made the resolution so, not I. I am adhering to the rules. I explained why I followed the rules.  Conclusion  Climate change (not the same thing as global warming) has been happening for millions of years before humanity was alive. To say that humans affected the climate so long ago is patently ridiculous. Vote Con based on arguments and conduct, as Pro makes unwarranted attacks on me (calling me a troll and such).</t>

    <t>C1) Climate sensitivity is likely high  Climate sensitivity is the key argument to this debate. Everyone agrees that CO2 has some direct effect, at least 1 degree C per doubling of CO2 concentration. This is what former climate modeler turned skeptic David Evans argues. “[All] serious skeptical scientists have always agreed with the government climate scientists about the direct effect of CO2. The argument is entirely about the feedbacks.” [1]  What are feedbacks? Feedbacks are important because they tell us how much warming we will have in the future. They amplify -- or dampen -- the warming effect of CO2. Changes in albedo, cloud cover, water vapor, and greenage can all affect warming.  If sensitivity is 2-3 degrees C, CO2 can explain most of the warming since the late 70s. If it is lower it still causes a significant amount. My opponent needs to pretty much argue that the amplification effects are under one in order to win.   Let us assume that climate sensitivity is low. Say, feedbacks are around zero (no positive or negative feedbacks);  every doubling of CO2 leads to roughly 1.1 degrees C increase in temperature. Even this unrealistically low climate sensitivity does not harm the AGW hypothesis. Nir Al Shaviv, a skeptical physicist, wrote a paper assuming the feedback effect was 1.1 degrees. He calculated that CO2 actually caused slightly over half of the modern warming trend [2] (about 57%). The famous Lindzen and Choi (and Spencer) results are really the only ones which cast doubt on the fact that CO2 is responsible for the warming. But Nir Al Shaviv told me in an email, “[m]y best estimate is that the sensitivity is higher than Lindzen and Choi, actually closed to no net amplifier, with the 50% of the CO2 doubling, the Anthropogenic contribution is also around 50%.” [3] Essentially, he verified what I sent to him in an email with calculations I had done assuming the amplifier was flat. My data found that it caused about 49.5% of the warming, but I failed to take into account the logarithmic effect of CO2, which makes the effect over 50%.   Even then, these assumptions are incorrect. Sensitivity is higher, and if it is, CO2 pretty much causes far more than 50% of the warming, but both estimates are enough to win me the debate. Research by Patrick Michaels, now a libertarian, CATO scholar found the amplifier to be 1.6 degrees C [4]. More than the 1.1 above. This puts the man made contribution to global warming above 50%, and certainly above 57%. This is not even including other gases which amplify the greenhouse effect.   The burgeoning evidence suggests that the net amplifier is around 2-3 degrees C. Based on multiple lines of evidence, stemming from volcanic eruptions, instrumental records, paleoclimatology, and more, the mean sensitivity sits firmly at about 3 degrees C. The following picture demonstrates the evidence.     As seen, the average never dips below 2 degrees C. The mean is 2 - 4.5 degrees C, all of which are enough for me to win the debate. 2 degrees C probably puts you around 70% of the warming is due to CO2, and 3 at nearly 100%, though I have not done the math (yet…). Some studies find fairly high sensitivity, around 4 degrees C. JD Annan, a leading climatologist, uses a Bayesian statistical technique, the predominant methodology in both the skeptic and realist literature. He found a mean sensitivity of 3 degrees C, with upper estimates at 4 degrees C, though still possible, but very unlikely below 3 degrees C [5].   The following graph [6], which I like because since I have used it pretty much everyone else has stolen it, shows the results from 3 leading studies. Although the results are uncertain, they are certain in that sensitivity is above 2 degrees C.     A new paper, published in 2012, actually went against the consensus and found low sensitivity. Despite this, their results concluded that “[h]umanity is . . . responsible for the most recent period of warming from 1976 to 2010.” [7]  Sensitivity is high. That means I win the debate. If it is low, I still win the debate because it caused 50% of more of the modern warm period.   C2) Evidence from paleoclimatology   I love paleoclimatology. I like geology and come from a family of geologists who are also oil entrepenueres (maybe why I still have skeptic leanings). And pretty solid evidence in the paleoclimatological record actually shows a strong CO2 effect. I am just going to c/p my debate with Roy.   There is significant evidence from paleoclimate records that CO2 can have an effect on changes in the climate. Climate skeptic and paleoclimatologist Bob Carter emphasizes the importance of paleoclimate data. He compares climate to a piece of string. The current instrumental data (1850 – present) is a very short period of time, according to Carter. And when the ‘string’ is lengthened, we see a lot of climactic variability. Instead of looking at the recent past, we should look at the entire temperature record in order to get an accurate picture of the climate [8]. I will provide evidenc, contrary to what Carter believes, lengthening the string supports AGW theory.  Over the Cenozoic Era, which began 66 million years ago, we see clear warming and cooling cycles caused by changes in CO2 concentrations. The sun increased slightly over that time period, whereas temperatures cooled. CO2, however, fell steadily through that time period. Plate tectonics was also accounted for. With natural forcings an unlikely cause, “CO2 was the dominant climate forcing in the Cenozoic” [9].  When you lengthen the ‘string’ over the course of the entire Phanerozoic (500 million years; begins at the Cambrian) there is still evidence of CO2 driving multiple climate changes. The GEOCARB study, published in 2001, is one of the definitive proxy records for CO2 concentrations within the last 500 million years. The study notes that “over the long term there is indeed a correlation between CO2 and paleotemperature” [10].  Evidence from the Vostok ice cores (specifically 240,000 before present), proves that CO2 has had an effect on temperatures. Although the initial forcing was orbital changes in the sun, CO2 “plays . . . a key role in amplifying the initial orbital forcing” and “the CO2 increase clearly precedes the Northern Hemisphere deglaciation”. The study also notes that these forcings “are also at work for the present-day and future climate” [11].  There is also proof that it is warmer now than it has been since the MWP. In fact, it is warmer now than any year since 1400 AD [12]. Newer reconstructions continue to support this finding, and even extends the dataset. It finds that the Roman warm period (RWP) and the MWP as much cooler than today, and claims to have replicated previous ‘hockey stick’ studies [19]. The results are depicted below.    Looking into the geologic past, we see strong evidence in favor of the idea that carbon dioxide can increase temperature. It logically follows that if humans continue to emit CO2, and other greenhouse gasses, that human emissions will increase temperatures.  C3) Consensus  Before I continue, I would like to note this argument in and of itself does not prove that global warming is caused by man. Actual evidence should be the driving force behind this debate. The reason I chose to put this in my argument is simple: the science is not clear because of consensus, but a consensus exists because the evidence is clear. This evidence will be discussed later.  A study published in Science reviewed the ISI web of science in order to take a survey of relevant climate literature as to what the causes of climate change are. The study failed to find a single paper which was in opposition to the consensus position, that the main driver of climate change is anthropogenic. 75% of the papers supported the consensus position, whereas 25% had no position (they were focused on things other than forgings, like impacts or paleoclimate) [14]. The study also noted how many organizations have come out supporting the idea of anthropogenic climate change. The IPCC, the American Meteorological Society, American Geophysical Union, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science have all concluded that the evidence for AGW is overwhelming [15].  NASA furthers this argument, noting “most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position”. They also argue “[n]inety-seven percent of climate scientists agree that climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities” [16].  A 196 page report representing 13 governmental agencies, and written by 28 authors from scientific institutions, has stated “[t]he global warming of the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced increases in heat-trapping gases” [17].</t>

    <t>In R1 global warming was defined as an average increase in temperature since the late 19th century. We have caused pretty much all of the warming since 1976 and a significant percent of the pre-1940 warming, with a cooling spell between the late 40s to early 70s because of human aerosol emissions and a decline in TSI.  King’s entire argument is… paleoclimate. But I don’t have to prove that we caused warming 500 million years ago, only since around 1870 or so. Paleoclimatology does have an application in this debate: whether or not CO2 causes (or doesn’t cause) past climate changes is important. It can prove whether or not CO2 has any influence on the climate. My opponent’s conclusion — that I have to prove changes before the industrial revolution — breaks rule 6, and warrants an automatic merit loss. I will refute the case anyway, but only the relevant details:  A) Phanerozoic temperature record  King shows us a graph plotting temperature and CO2 throughout the phanerozoic eon, and tells us that there is no correlation. For at least the last few thousand years, CO2 has had a strong impact on climate [1].  Unfortunately,King’s graph uses a study which I preempted. It must be noted that the graph my opponent uses does not show the error bars, so any correlation (or non correlation) is uncertain at best. And, as I argued last round, the man who made the graph (GEOCARB; Berner 2001) actually says that there exists a long term correlation between temperature and carbon dioxide [2].  Berner’s study also fails to take into account saturation effects. When this is accounted for, the correlation between CO2 and temperature is almost perfect [3].  So, the second graph my opponent uses is blatantly incorrect. Not only do the authors of the data say that I am correct, not only do the error bars tell us that the results are not really with my opponent, but a separate analysis *improving* the methodology finds a nearly *perfect* correlation between CO2 and temperature.  B) More recent temperature changes  The graph my opponent uses seems like a sketchy-tabloid esque graph. There is no reason to trust it. The data is not so cut and dry, especially because data exists showing that temperatures are warmer — not cooler — than temperatures within the past 1000 years [4].  And the timescale king uses is cherry picked. Using the past 65 million years, CO2 is the predominant climate forcing of temperature changes [5]. Research focusing on the past few interglacials — which includes king’s graph — has concluded that CO2 “plays . . . a key role in amplifying the initial orbital forcing.” [6]  Plus, the graph king uses does not take into account other forcings. Of course other factors exist in climate — I am not arguing that CO2 is the only one, only that is can be (and is) a forcing since about 1870. Climate changes in response to whatever forcing exists at that date and time. And today, CO2 is driving climate. Just like how short term (volcanoes) and long-term (GCR fluctuations) can all affect climate, CO2 has *always* played *some* role in climate. On some timescales, it is dominant [3][4]. Merely because climate has changed for other reasons does not mean that humans have no effect. Most of the time, it is not a gun which kills a person, but it would be wrong to conclude that guns do not kill. Just because climate has changed before does not necessarily mean that our change is natural.  C) Humans have only existed for 200,000 years  So? </t>

    <t>First off, THANK YOU! I am very excited to have this debate, and I hope it goes well.This debate assumes that climate change has happened over the past centuries, and that over that period of time there has been a overall increase in global temperatures. So yes, I think. Before we start I would like to present these following facts/opinion that I humbly ask my opponent and voters to count as truth in this debate. As of now, current levels of CO2 are around 400 parts per million, give or take a little. Another is that most scientists who believe in Antropogenic Warming think that global temperatures will increase by 2-4 degrees C by the end of the century. Finally, most of said Anthropogenic Global Warming is caused by release of CO2 according to most scientists who believe in this form of warming. Make any changes or additions to this list as you see fit, also while some of these are opinions I ask that in this debate we consider them truths. If you disagree please make it be known in you speech, and provide counter 'truths.' Lets Begin! Arguments that Contradict and Disprove the Idea of Anthropogenic Global Warming 18 Year Equalibrium: In this argument we will examine the fact that there has been no warming for 18 years and 4 months. (actually 6, but site is one month old)  From December 1996-March 2015 there has been no global warming as shown in the average. This really is shocking in the grand scheme of things because this proves that despite the world blasting carbon into the air, there has been no change in average temperature. This completely contradicts what Pro-antropogenic Global Warming scientists believe, meaning that they have prodicted it all incorrectly. 30000 Scientists: In this argument we look at the MASSIVE number of scientists that oppose the idea of Anthropogenic Global Warming. A petition has been cycling has aquired 31,487 scientists who reject the idea of Antropogenic Global Warming, 9,029 of those individuals have a PHD. An argument of the oppisate side is that there is a concensus amongst scientists that Global Warming is caused, but these numbers clearly destroy this notion. When we have this many scientists, especially those with PHDs, who say that global warming is not caused by human activities and any 'evidence' that says otherwise is false, you must assume that something simply is not correct with the opposing arguments. Antarctic/Arctic Ice: In this argument we will examine the fact that Antarctic Ice has hit all time records and the fact that Arctic Ice rebounded by 50% from 2012-2013.   Antarctic Ice hit its all time record in 2014, surpassing the 20 million square millimeter mark. The antarctic ice has been increasing by about 18,900 square kilometers since recording first began. Increase in this ice has been occuring for several years, and in the past few years have been making new records while Arctic Ice on the other hand has been struggling. I frankly will be the first to admit it, however I will LOUDLY proclaim the fact that it has been making comebacks. From 2012 to 2013 Arctic ice rebounded by 50%. This means that despite this 'global warming,' ice continued to increase. So basically during this time period, both the arctic and antarctic ice increased, despit increased CO2 which should have caused an increase in temperature. Even though Arctic Ice had been shrinking, the fact that it increased speaks volumes to what is really happening.   Ice Age: In this argument we will examine an ice age that occured whis CO2 levels were signifigantly higher than they are today. s://stevengoddard.files.wordpress.com...; alt='' width='640' height='404' /gt;  (this graph shows the Atmoshperic Carbon Levels and Average Global Temperatures from around 600 million years ago till today) As this graph clearly depicts that at around the 450 million year mark Earth went into a HUGE ice age. However during this time CO2 Levels were at a little more than 4000 ppm. 4000! This means that Earth was experiencing and ice age while the CO2 levels were more than 10 times what they are today. Now the fact is: if what some scientists are saying is true, and CO2 has the power to raise the temperature of the planet by 2-4 degrees by the end of century, then this simply should not have happend. The is conclusion is this: CO2 does not have an impact on global temperatures because there have been cases in past where huge opposites have occured that simply should not have happened according to opposing scientists.  Flawed Arguments of the Opposing Side  97% Consensus: This argument examines the often sited 97% consesus of scientists that believe global warming is real and is caused by human activities and is dangerous.  This study was run by one person and a couple friends who supposably read over 10,000 papers, and said that 97% endorsed the idea that global warming is human caused, and dangerous. However, a professor and 3 coauthors went back through and looked at these papers and saw that this was simply not the case. In fact, they found that only 0.3% of these papers supported the idea. Therefore we can conclude that the 97% consensus is false. The reason you believe the professor is because he is a professor. The other individual was a blogger, who to the extent of my knowledge did not have these types of credentials and could not have made better conclusions than the proffesor.   Weather:  In this argument we examine how arguments about weather are completely unjustified.  Tornados are at an all time low. These past three years have seen signifigantly less tornadic events than any other year since monitoring in the 1950s. Major hurricanes have been at or bellow average for the past 50 years, whereas the before years before that had substantially more with only one year that was below average.    The above graph shows that droughts have been very stable over the past few years, despite the idea that the Earth should heating up. In fact there has been no signifigant changes with number of droughts or their severity, so any argumnet that droughts are increasing is just false. The opposing argument often points bad weather and says 'Ha! Here! We told you this would happen!.' But the fact is, bad weather happens, and we should not assume the globe is warming just because some bad weather happens here and there.     Climate Models: This argument looks at the climate models that the pro-Anthropogenic Climate Scientists.   A former NASA scientist has examined the climate models and found that of those he examined, 95% of thes overcasted actual warming for years, meaning that they have been wrong time and time agian about what the global temperature SHOULD have been. I will tie this into another point, and that is that almost all predictions made by pro-Anthropogenic Global Warming scientists have been WRONG! By now the ice caps should be MELTED! Polar bears should be drowning! However as shown above this was simply proven to be completely false.   Hockeystick Graph: This argument examines the often sited 'Hockeystick Graph.'   No specific site for this one, I just know about it. So the problem with the graph is that it is a cherrypicked portion of global temperatures on Earth, and if we looked at centuries prior we would see similar, if not higher Temperature Levels without added CO2 by humans. So basically it is more of a scare tactic than actual proof of Anthropogenic Global Warming.     THANK YOU so much for debating me, and I appologize if I did everything wrong, but this is part of the reason I am doing this so if you could just give me some tips and corrections I would be most appreciative. Also, the 'truths' at the top probabaly should have been stated at the beginning, so I appologize for that.</t>

    <t>I thank Kylar for accepting this debate.   C1) Climate Sensitivity amp; Feedbacks  My first contention is to demonstrate CO2 has effects in rising the mean land-sea temperature. Climate sensitivity is the level of hypothetical temperature rise if the concentration of atmospheric CO2 would double. [1] It is not a much debated fact that the temperature rise would be by 1 degrees C. This, though, can be amplified by feedbacks. Positive feedbacks amplify the temperature rise, and negative feedbacks diminish the temperature rise.   A study published in Climate Research proved that the mean climate sensitivity is approximately 1 to 1.6 degrees Celsius due to the level of positive feedbacks. [2] Another significant body of research notes that climate sensitivity is likely much higher. A review of the evidence in 2008 finds that mean climate sensitivity is 3 degrees C, with a range of 2 – 4.5 degrees C. Nearly every study taken discovers the average climate sensitivity is 3 degrees C. [3]    The above graph demonstrates the effect of upper fluctuations in equilibrium temperature via. feedbacks. [4]    The graph shown above was from a 2007 research that places approximate mean climate sensitivity to double CO2 concentration at around 2.5 - 3. [5]   It is a well known fact that industrial emissions have major impact on the concentration levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. “In pre-industrial times over the last 10,000 years, CO2 was relatively stable at around 275 to 285 parts per million. Over the last 250 years, atmospheric CO2 levels have increased by about 100 parts per million.” [6]   Thus, human-caused amplified climate sensitivity affects mean land-sea temperature.   C2) Human-Emitted Greenhouse Gases  There is a documented rise in CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere over the last 250 years, with a 100 ppm increase in industrial times *alone*, versus a 50 ppm increase from 9,750 years prior. Below is a graph showing the rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. [7-8]    It is a well-known fact that majority of increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations is caused by humans. This is because of the sudden hike during industrial times alone. [6] CO2 is known to form an atmospheric layer and trap heat within the atmosphere, thus increasing the mean temperature via. the greenhouse effect, wherein insolation and terrestrial radiation are both trapped within the atmosphere. [9-10]   Below is a graph showing a correlation in the rise in temperature and rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations.     “[T]here is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr.” [11]   The CO2-temperature correlation is also influenced by CO2’s impact on solar radiation itself. In the Cenozoic era, there was a rise in solar activity due to CO2. “Because Earth absorbs about 240 W/m^2 of solar energy, that brightness increase is a forcing of about 1 W/m^2. This small linear increase of forcing, by itself, would have caused a modest global warming through the Cenozoic Era.' The CO2 levels caused a much higher forcing. In contrast, atmospheric CO2 during the Cenozoic changed from at least 1000 ppm in the early Cenozoic to as small as 170 ppm during recent ice ages. The resulting climate forcing, as can be computed accurately for this CO2 range using formulae in Table 1 of Hansen et al. (2000), exceeds 10 W/m^2. It is clear that CO2 was the dominant climate forcing in the Cenozoic.” [12]   There is proof that it is warmer now than any year of human life since 1400. This is depicted in the graph below. [13]      Conclusion  Thus, I have presented two valid contentions as to why global warming is man-made. Con must present contentions of their own in the next round and defend theirs in the round after. The resolution is resoundingly affirmed. </t>

    <t>I thank my friend for this debate and I am sorry for the mix-up. Now to post arguments:  How did global warming discussions end up hinging on what's happening with polar bears, unverifiable predictions of what will happen in a hundred years, and whether people are 'climate deniers' or 'global warming cultists?' If this is a scientific topic, why aren't we spending more time discussing the science involved? Why aren't we talking about the evidence and the actual data involved? Why aren't we looking at the predictions that were made and seeing if they match up to the results? If this is such an open and shut case, why are so many people who care about science skeptical? Many Americans have long since thought that the best scientific evidence available suggested that man wasn't causing any sort of global warming. However, now, we can go even further and suggest that the planet isn't warming at all.  1) There hasn't been any global warming since 1997: If nothing changes in the next year, we're going to have kids who graduate from high school who will have never seen any 'global warming' during their lifetimes. That's right; the temperature of the planet has essentially been flat for 17 years. This isn't a controversial assertion either. Even the former Director of the Climate Research Unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia, Phil Jones, admits that it's true. Since the planet was cooling from 1940-1975 and the upswing in temperature afterward only lasted 22 years, a 17 year pause is a big deal. It also begs an obvious question: How can we be experiencing global warming if there's no actual 'global warming?'  2) There is no scientific consensus that global warming is occurring and caused by man: Questions are not decided by 'consensus.' In fact, many scientific theories that were once widely believed to be true were made irrelevant by new evidence. Just to name one of many, many examples, in the early seventies, scientists believed global cooling was occurring. However, once the planet started to warm up, they changed their minds. Yet, the primary 'scientific' argument for global warming is that there is a 'scientific consensus' that it's occurring. Setting aside the fact that's not a scientific argument, even if that ever was true (and it really wasn't), it's certainly not true anymore. Over 31,000 scientists have signed on to a petition saying humans aren't causing global warming. More than 1000 scientists signed on to another report saying there is no global warming at all. There are tens of thousands of well-educated, mainstream scientists who do not agree that global warming is occurring at all and people who share their opinion are taking a position grounded in science.  3) Arctic ice is up 50% since 2012: The loss of Arctic ice has been a big talking point for people who believe global warming is occurring. Some people have even predicted that all of the Arctic ice would melt by now because of global warming. Yet, Arctic ice is up 50% since 2012. How much Arctic ice really matters is an open question since the very limited evidence we have suggests that a few decades ago, there was less ice than there is today, but the same people who thought the drop in ice was noteworthy should at least agree that the increase is important as well.  4) Climate models showing global warming have been wrong over and over: These future projections of what global warming will do to the planet have been based on climate models. Essentially, scientists make assumptions about how much of an impact different factors will have; they guess how much of a change there will be and then they project changes over time. Unfortunately, almost all of these models showing huge temperature gains have turned out to be wrong.  Former NASA scientist Dr. Roy Spencer says that climate models used by government agencies to create policies 'have failed miserably.' Spencer analyzed 90 climate models against surface temperature and satellite temperature data, and found that more than 95 percent of the models 'have over-forecast the warming trend since 1979, whether we use their own surface temperature dataset (HadCRUT4), or our satellite dataset of lower tropospheric temperatures (UAH).' There's an old saying in programming that goes, 'Garbage in, garbage out.' In other words, if the assumptions and data you put into the models are faulty, then the results will be worthless. If the climate models that show a dire impact because of global warming aren't reliable -- and they're not -- then the long term projections they make are meaningless.  5) Predictions about the impact of global warming have already been proven wrong: The debate over global warming has been going on long enough that we've had time to see whether some of the predictions people made about it have panned out in the real world. For example, Al Gore predicted all the Arctic ice would be gone by 2013. In 2005, the Independent ran an article saying that the Artic had entered a death spiral.  Scientists fear that the Arctic has now entered an irreversible phase of warming which will accelerate the loss of the polar sea ice that has helped to keep the climate stable for thousands of years....The greatest fear is that the Arctic has reached a 'tipping point' beyond which nothing can reverse the continual loss of sea ice and with it the massive land glaciers of Greenland, which will raise sea levels dramatically. Of course, the highway is still there. Meanwhile, Arctic ice is up 50% since 2012. James Hansen of NASA fame predicted that the West Side Highway in New York would be under water by now because of global warming.  If the climate models and the predictions about global warming aren't even close to being correct, wouldn't it be more scientific to reject hasty action based on faulty data so that we can further study the issue and find out what's really going on?</t>
<h>    Some people have even predicted that all of the Arctic ice would melt by now because of global warming.</h>

    <t>Observations  Ob1: Under “Full Resolution”, it clearly says the existence of GW is assumed, and Con must show that it is not man-made. This is violated by Con, but I shall rebut it nonetheless.   Ob2: Once more, Con’s entire case is C/P’d from his source (albeit the source is presented this time), thus there are no original arguments presented by Con.   Ob3: Con violates the debate structure by dropping ALL my arguments. I extend all my arguments to this round.   Rebuttals  R1) Global Warming Exists  According to NASA’s GISS surface temperature analysis, the global mean land-sea temperature rose from 1980 to 2014 by 0.8 degrees Celsius, and the corresponding graph shows a constant increase in temperature throughout the years from 1980 to 2014 [1].     The alleged 17-year pause is incorrect, as there has been a 0.8 degrees C increase in temperature. The global land-sea average temperature in December 2014 was the highest monthly land-sea average in 135 years [2]. There have been major temperature anomalies throughout December 2014 itself [3].    R2) Scientific Consensus  A study published in Science reviewed the ISI web of science in order to take a survey of relevant climate literature as to what the causes of climate change are. The study failed to find a single paper which was in opposition to the consensus position, that the main driver of climate change is anthropogenic. 75% of the papers supported the consensus position, whereas 25% had no position (they were focused on things other than forgings, like impacts or paleoclimate) [4]. “[T]he National Academy of Sciences report, Climate Change Science: An Analysis of Some Key Questions, begins: “Greenhouse gases are accumulating in Earth's atmosphere as a result of human activities, causing surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise.” [4-5] A 196 page report representing 13 governmental agencies, and written by 28 authors from scientific institutions, has stated “[t]he global warming of the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced increases in heat-trapping gases …” [6] According to NASA, “[n]inety-seven percent of climate scientists agree that climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities.” [7]     Above is a graph presented by 4 major institutes that have taken a study on the temperature anomaly, and the results from NASA, MOHC/CRU, NOAA Climatic Data Center, and the Japanese Meteorological Agency have almost identical results [7].   R3) Arctic Ice  Con concedes that this is irrelevant to the issue, and this is merely a prediction made by some supporters of global warming, thus I need not address this. Nonetheless, I wish to point out that “[t]he European Space Agency’s CryoSat mission has returned its latest map of Arctic sea ice volumes, recording a slight decrease in thickness over previous measurements.” [8]   R4) Climate Models  While climate models may have been wrong, they were only predictions of the increase. A certain level of increase happened nonetheless, and that is relevant to the resolution, while this is completely irrelevant to the resolution.   R5) Predictions  This is a repeat of “Climate Models” and “Arctic Ice”. The current data is not faulty unless proven otherwise, thus this argument is useless and irrelevant.   I sincerely request Con to frame his own argument for the next round instead of C/Ping it.   Arguments  ALL my arguments are dropped. I extend all my arguments.</t>

In addition, my opponent’s ‘case’ is plagiarized [1].

    <t>I accept your debate, pro! Now, there is a good deal of evidence that humans are not causing global warming at all. It was simply America heeding Al Gore's warnings based on misguided interpretations of scientific studies. Our planet has a natural cycle of heating up and cooling back down. In fact, from 1940 to 1975, 'global cooling' was the big issue, but that scientific theory was discovered to be false. You can read about global cooling here.  This isn't just an ignorant, uneducated viewpoint; thousands of scientists have signed a petition claiming that humans aren't causing global warming. A lot of environmentalists claim that because there is a scientific consensus and all sorts of graphs and charts, global warming is definitely real. That isn't how questions are answered. A lot of scientific theories were widely accepted by the public in the past were suddenly made irrelevant with new evidence.  It's widely believed that global warming is causing Arctic ice to melt. Mysteriously, the Arctic ice cap has expanded by 50% since 2012. Also, the climate models created by skilled scientists, who can't even accurately predict when it will rain half of the time, have been wrong over and over. As many as 95% of them have proven inaccurate. There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere.  But let's just say that if global warming theorists were right, which they are not in many cases, what would happen if the Earth became filled up with the greenhouse effect? It has happened before in the Earth's history, in the Ordovician period 440 million years ago. The carbon dioxide concentration was up by a whopping 16 times that of today. The planet still supported plenty of flora and fauna, so the environment certainly wasn't in danger. These carbon dioxide emissions were caused by mass volcanic activity, and they were eventually brought down by the same thing, volcanic activity. Global warming is not being caused by humans, and there is no clear or present danger because of it.</t>

    <t>Very well, here are my closing thoughts. I do believe that global warming exists, and I must correct you: my argument was not that global warming will have no repercussions on the environment at all. My argument was that it won't be as severe as the 'doomsday' scientists predict will come very soon. Though arguments from your side of the spectrum are very much based in fact and science, it should be at least acknowledged that in the end, humans are prone to error, including scientists, and they cannot predict the future. This is a simple truth that I can't really cite sources for. It's a shrewd quality to be cautious for the worst possible outcome, but it shouldn't gain so much attention in politics. The United States government, however, spends around $20 billion for both global warming and nuclear weapons, relatively equal. While trying to protect the planet in all of its natural beauty in a noble cause, it's simply not realistic to spend billions of dollars on it. Instead, the government should be focusing on education, military, and law enforcement: issues that are relevant and short-term. To conclude, global warming exists, but is not grave or tangible enough to be treated as a serious issue in the politics of today's world.  Good luck, Pro. Thank you for a good debate.</t>

    <t>Panicking of environmentalists about climate change is based on future projections and speculation, nearly all of which have turned out to be wrong. Humans may be contributing to shifts in the Earth's temperature. Al Gore claimed that by 2012, Antarctica would be completely melted due to global warming. What melting-ice-caps activists fail to realize is that most of Antarctica's ice is already underwater. When you put a piece of ice in a glass of water, it raises slightly, does it not? And when that ice melts, does the water level raise? No, because it has already been displaced by the ice. The ocean works by those rules, and there is no danger of a global flood.  Another fault in environmentalist logic is their emphasis on how humans are the only reason global warming could possibly happen. Humans do have an affect on the environment, of course. But their impact is relatively small, because natural cycles and extinction events will happen whether or not fossil fuels are being burned. Even if humanity makes no attempt to switch to a different energy source, temperature will only rise a few degrees Celsius. Effects of this would be minor, certainly not helping to spread diseases, droughts, or smog. Even less likely is a mass extinction event.</t>

Livestock is a bigger threat than humans in contributing to climate change.Also the same webiste, skeptical science, states that natural causes like oceans and vegitation are 750 giggatons while out output is 29giggatonsLet me use your equation  ( (The amount of CO2 emitted by humans in 2010 in tons) * (Number of kilograms in a ton) / (Density of CO2 in kg/m^3) ) / ( (Area of Rhode Island in square miles) * (Number of square meters in a square mile) ) = Height of jar in metersLets switch it up witht the amount of greenhouses gases emmited by nature in tons.

I hate to break it to you, but the reason why cows aren't usually mentioned in global warming studies is because the cow problem...  Has already been solved!  Fish oils reduce by 20% (1) Gas capturing by 25% (2) Fart-reducing supplement by 60% (3)  And farmers who own these cows aren't reluctant in doing this!

We are offsetting the balance, however, which puts CO2 into the atmosphere.  'albedo clouds are changing and that there are emmiting more than 2x the greenhouse gases humans are emmiting'  Wait, they are emitting greenhouse gases? First, that is completely wrong. Clouds don't emit greenhouse gases. Second, Albedo is steady as shown in the website.

    <t>You said yourself, 'that the co2 being placed in the atmosphere is causing natural changes'. Who is placing that CO2 in the atmosphere? Us! See the bottom.  'the increasing birth rate of cows, who can produce enought carbon dioxide and methane to fill up a jar the size of Rhode island'  1. The link is faulty. 2. A jar the size of Rhode Island would be 2-D 3. If you had a jar with the base being Rhode Island, and it was filled with all of the CO2 emitted by humans in 2010, the height of the jar would be:  ( (The amount of CO2 emitted by humans in 2010 in tons) * (Number of kilograms in a ton) / (Density of CO2 in kg/m^3) ) / ( (Area of Rhode Island in square miles) * (Number of square meters in a square mile) ) = Height of jar in meters  ( 33615389000 * 907.185 / 1.98 ) / ( 1212 * 2589988 ) = Approximately 4906.462 meters  So the jar would be about as high as 6 Burj Khalifas stacked on top of each other. That's for humans.  'chnages in the formation of albedo clouds can create a negative feedbacks that cancel out all or nearly all of warming effect of higher level of co2.'  Well, well, well. Look what we have here: (1)  You see, earth's albedo has been very steady, but the earth is warming. The albedo, while playing an important factor, isn't doing much nowadays.  'that the greatest influence on climate is the transformation of Earths surface'  See the bottom.  'how the natural process of algea is being adapted to the new formation of currents and is a prime factor in the realese of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere'  Algae consumes CO2.

NOW!  Next one says that the sun can cause climate change.  Well, the sun has been on a cooling trend since the 60's, but the Earth has been warming. (3)  NOTE REBUTTAL!  'At first, people where afraid that the earth was going to be placed in another iceage because of Co2 not in a rising temperature.'  Actually, most people thought the earth was going to warm, not go into another ice age. The thing is, Man-Made Global Warming says that the earth is warming, and people are making the earth warm due to CO2 emissions. If you think that the CO2 emissions are causing something else that causes warming, that still means you believe in Man-Made Global Warming.</t>

    <t>A significant tip of the hat to Con for their respect and generosity. Nice to know that religious debates still have the capacity to end on a professional note. Let's do it again sometime (preferably when I'm not under a thousand deadlines)! As all the following points are directed specifically at Christianity, I will approach my rebuttals from that perspective as far as my character limit will allow (which is less than I would like, sadly). First of all, religion is not as simple as we'd all like it to be, and as such, it needs to be handled carefully. It's safe to say that people who have spent their entire lives studying the biblical texts, thousands of years of exegesis, theology, and hermeneutics, and careful examination of the bible's original culture, heritage, treatment, languages, and context are going to know a lot more about how Christianity should be practiced than the average soccer mom or politician. Just like an actual medical scientist with a degree and ten years of university education is going to know a lot more about vaccines than a talk show host. It's the church's job to communicate its truths just like it's the medical community's job to communicate its truths (although there will invariably be dissent in both camps on certain issues, and one cannot guarantee that the masses will listen). If the church has failed in this commission, that's hardly the fault of Christianity itself, which actually condemns failure to properly instruct. Credit where credit is due. Con asks the question of what makes someone an extremist. My definition of an extremist is someone who takes an idea farther than it was meant to go, and subsequently causes harm. This can apply to religion, politics, civil rights... any opinion one has passion for, which is why we must be careful not to appeal to our emotions before we have considered our reasoning.  “from my personal experience, religion never does what it claims (makes people kinder or more moral).”  From my personal experience, religion never fails to do so. To each their own?  “The idea that the Old Testament is somehow 'null and void' because of the 'new covenant' is not biblically supportable (in fact, Jesus is quoted as saying that he comes not to change the [Mosaic] law) and will offend a significant number of Christians; are they extremists?” There are a few problems with Con's statement. Firstly, I never actually said that the Old Testament is null and void in Christianity. I said that the old covenant is. They are not the same thing. Secondly, what Jesus says in Matthew 5 is “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.” The word “change” does not appear in any translation I've been able to find, so saying Jesus is “quoted” as saying it is a bit of an exaggeration. Christ's sacrifice fulfilled the law and established a new covenant with all people. This covenant was built on the foundations of the old one, which is why many of the moral precepts in the Old Testament (the ten commandments, for instance) are still applicable, but the laws concerning what is clean and unclean, or laws discussing the judicial punishments for sin in the nation of Israel, etc., are not. My original point still stands. Any Christians who believe that the entire Mosaic law still applies to them have hugely misunderstood their theology (and seeing how few of them are willing to actually follow the 900+ laws contained therein, I'd say we have a hypocrisy problem as well). 'I know this: families are literally torn apart because a son is gay; that sentence needs correction: families are literally torn apart because they are religious; homosexuality is not a choice, religion is.' I am unaware of a single passage of Scripture that endorses the appalling treatment of homosexuals that the church has engaged in. I am, however, aware of thousands that condemn it. “I've met people on this site who literally stand for bringing back stoning-to-death because the bible prescribes it... are they extremists? Does their existence or, more properly, do their beliefs not demonstrate the responsibility that religion has for making the World a worse place?” I've seen atheists who believe that the only problem with Communism is that it didn't kill enough believers. I've seen atheists use Charles Darwin to promote and excuse eugenics, murder, rape, and racism. I've seen atheists who claim that anyone who subscribes to religious belief should be thrown into psychological institutions and tortured until they're “cured.” Is the world improved by their existence or beliefs? In my previous argument, I addressed that the bloodiest democidal regimes of the 20th century were almost exclusively spearheaded by atheists, despite the fact that, from a global perspective, atheists are an incredibly small demographic. Is that not reason to be concerned? Furthermore, if a Christian promotes slavery because of Deuteronomy, I can show him Galatians 3:28, which proclaims that there is no slave and free, Jew and Gentile, male and female, because we are all equal under Christ. However, if an atheist promotes slavery because of naturalism and survival of the fittest (after all, Slave-Making Ants do precisely what their name implies, why shouldn't we?), I have nothing to offer him but pseudo-philosophy and an ethics lecture which he would be well within his rights to dismiss as insufficient evidence. Is that enough reason to condemn non-belief as dangerous? “James Inhofe is potentially the most powerful man on Earth in terms of setting policy regarding man-made climate change, limiting carbon emissions, limiting agricultral chemical run-off, pollution, etc... and he says that there's no such thing as man-made climate change and he seems to think that Bronze Age texts (specifically the book of Genesis) prove that fact. What's worse is that he uses Romans 1:25 to peddle the idea that any climate campaigners are essentially working for the devil by worshipping false gods (worshipping the creation not the creator).” Strange, that, seeing as the very book of Genesis names Man as the steward of Earth, and discusses his responsibility in its subsequent corruption after the Fall. The bible also discusses how creation declares the glory of God. What reason could we possibly have to want for its destruction? Someone who cannot be bothered to read anything more than what they personally find useful is a hypocrite, and someone who thinks that the bible has anything significant to say on a topic as isolated to modern science as climate change (or GMOs, for that matter) is someone I won't hesitate to accuse of using religion as a cover for their personal biases. However, once again, we cannot necessarily blame religion for its idiots. “The Catholic church [peddles] the idea that condoms are universally wicked; the result of this is absolutely, specifically and directly that innocent men women and children suffer horribly and die because of the unnecessary spread of AIDS in Africa [2]. I blame religion for this effect; are you with me?” This is actually nowhere near as cut-and-dried as people think it is. Abstinence, fewer sexual partners, and monogamy are doing more to halt the AIDS crisis than condoms [1] [2]. Strangely, all three of those sound suspiciously like Christian teachings. 'in reality, murder rates are not obviously negatively correlated (quite the opposite) with religiosity.' Con has not addressed my rebuttals on this point. Finally, I actually would stand to disagree with Con that group selection accounts for morality and renders religion unnecessary in that regard. Group selection is a logical concept, but not a realistic one. After all, while a tribe that shares its food equally among its members will be stronger than a tribe that does not, tribal members that exploit the altruism of their fellows and hoard whatever food they can grab will be much stronger and better off than those they are exploiting, and will therefore be better candidates for natural selection. Even positing social consequence (i.e., they choose not to steal food for fear of a punishment from the tribe) falls flat because it requires there to already be a moral understanding in place (i.e., stealing food is wrong, and deserves to be punished). Morality of the kind that humans currently possess is not realistic through an evolutionary lens, because the “selfish gene” cannot (and has no reason to) act in the best interests of the group, only the individual. Even kin selection only explains altruism within one's genetic group. As far as this debate goes, here's what I acknowledge:    1. beliefs, more often than not, lead to actions.    2. if those beliefs are harmful, the actions will be harmful.    3. if religions preach things that are harmful, and people believe and act on them, it's safe to say that religion does not improve the state of the world.    But I also believe this:   1. religion teaches many things that are good, just, merciful, kind, and selfless.   2. religion is not to blame for people who misuse it or misunderstand it.   3. atheism/secularism has just as much capacity to cause evil as religion.   In conclusion, this debate has not seen me at my best. I feel it is only right to admit defeat, as I agree entirely that I have not provided sufficient evidence that religion, as a whole, makes the world a better place. I do believe that Christianity, at least, is a force for good, and I believe I can (and have) made that point to one degree or another, but as far as the topic at hand, I acknowledge my lack of a strong case. I thank Con for an insightful discussion, and hope the voters will bestow their points on the deserving winner.</t>

    <t>First of all, I'd like to thank Pro for accepting the debate and tip my hat to a clinical first round.I do concede one aspect of religion that is almost unambiguously positive: it provides individuals with a support group.  This seemingly simple provision has lots of knock-on effects, and I would argue that one mechanism underpinning many of Pro's first statistics (insofar as they are accurate) is the sense of community that a church engenders; we are, after all is said and done, highly social animals.I consider this a challenge to secular communities around the World: we must find a way to reproduce that one powerful and important successful aspect of religion... the stability of a support network of mutual trust and love.  I see no reason why this effect cannot be achieved in a secular setting, thus robbing religion of a monopoly that it currently exploits.Right now, secular communities are in the large part failing this challenge; this situation provides the basis to make the claim that religion is making the World better... in one sense, it is... it is via our religions that we have (as a species) discovered the most successful bonding mechanisms for large groups.  There are dangers as well as benefits, though; the power that religion weilds is both a cohesive and a divisive force.  I will return to this idea in a later round.Pro begins on the edge of a very real (but small) effect: atheism correlates with higher suicide rates.  On the face of it, this is a no-brainer win for Pro.  I beseech the gentle reader consider why the correlation happens, though.  It is a discussion that has been thrashed out over the years; one key player in the understanding of the effect is the philosopher David Émile Durkheim, who has been widely acknowledged as one of the fathers of modern Sociology.  Whilst I do not think that everything he says is right, I would encourage any gentle reader interested in the subject from a scholarly perspective to begin with Durkheim.Unfortunately, the study that Pro cited is not particularly useful in studying the effect.  Problems include:1.  The study is looking at suicide attempts, not completed suicides.  It should not need stating but we have much more accurate statistics about actual suicides than about attempts.2.  The study has n=371; this is *far* too small a group to draw conclusions from.3.  It is unclear how effectively the study selected the 371 participants in an impartial way.But didn't I already concede the point that atheism correlates with higher suicide rates?  Yes, yes, I did... but the very article to which Pro directs our attention [1] warns away from a simplistic interpretation of this fact by saying 'compassionate tolerance for suicide and euthenasia are widely regarded as hallmarks of many secular societies'.  It may also be noted that more men commit suicide than women, that suicide rates are higher in rural communities AND that suicide rates are higher in industrialized countries.The point that I'm making here is that suicide (or euthanasia) might not be universally bad.  I, for one, present my thinking on this point in this way:1.  There exists such a reality as can be described by the words 'a fate worse than death'2.  I can see no moral justification for pressuring any sentient being who self-identifies 'a fate worse than death' to endure it. - (unless they have dependents, when the story may be more complex)The idea that suicide is universally unacceptable seems to me an artefact of religion (so strong was this pressure that attempting suicide was a criminal offence in my native England until 1961).  What moral reason does the atheist have for objecting to suicide? We don't have to like it, but atheists are generally more accepting of the idea in principle.  Of course we would encourage counselling or medical routes before agreeing that this last resort is a good answer to a given situation.In short, I see no reason why we should accept that a very small decrease in suicides in some American religious communities equates to the World being a better place.  In extreme cases, it may even mean that because of religious pressure (it's a sin to kill yourself), some individuals manfully endure a fate worse than death.  This seems to me to be a bad thing.  I hope that I have given the pensive reader pause for thought.So far I've dedicated half of my space this round to Pro's first claim.  This seems excessive, perhaps, but I wanted to explore Pro's primary claim first.  In case Pro didn't intend for the claims to be in priority order, I invite Pro to pick one or more 'favourite' claims in order to reduce the sheer volume of discourse that would be necessary to tackle some of the issues.More briefly, then, I'll examine the rest of the claims that Pro makes; if Pro wishes to focus their claims then I will dedicate more effort (as I have with suicide).Pro's second claim was based on a paper called “Relationships among Spirituality, Religious Practices, Personality Factors, and Health for Five Different Faiths”, which I took the time to look up.  This paper [2] refers to a study done on 160 people.  I hope that our audience will not be swayed by such small studies, from which we can draw no more than loose conclusions about how such effects may be evident in broader populations.I suggest reference to the rough-guide table of requisite sample sizes provided by the Open University in my reference [3].  According to this table, a study of 371 people may be suitable to describe a population of about 10,000 people.  A study of 160 people may be suitable to describe a population of up to 500 people.  You would need more than 384 people in a study to justify describing a population of 1,000,000 and more again to describe the population of the UK, the US, Europe, Africa or, as the resolution requires, the World.  It is not good science to take a study of 160 people and generalise about the World. Sorry, Pro, but this just won't do.  I'm also going to include a link [4] which may not be considered as authoritative as the OU, but explains the issues around sample size in a more accessible way.Pro's third link discusses a study of 179 people; sorry to get boring, but this won't do.Pro's fourth link at least looks more promissing, certainly in numbers.  In a study of 3,968 older adults in the Piedmont region of North Carolina... I'm going to stop here because I haven't limitless room to debate.  I will come back to this and the other links Pro offers in a later round if necessary.  For now, I'd like the gentle reader to note that all of Pro's statistics relate to America and that the proposition before us relates to the World.Phil Zuckerman has completed a World-wide meta-study to answer some of the questions [5].  He is very clear about his methodology and sample sizes.  I'm going to list some of his findings (all available from [5]).0.2 percent of prisoners in the USA are atheists(10% - 30% of the American population are atheist, depending on specific definition)If religion, prayer, or God-belief hindered criminal behavior, and secularity or atheism fostered lawlessness, we would expect to find the most religious nations having the lowest murder rates and the least religious nations having the highest. But we find just the opposite. Murder rates are actually lower in more secular nations and higher in more religious nations where belief in God is deep and widespread (Jensen 2006; Paul 2005; Fajnzylber et al. 2002; Fox and Levin 2000). And within America, the states with the highest murder rates tend to be highly religious, such as Louisiana and Alabama, but the states with the lowest murder rates tend to be among the least religious in the country, such as Vermont and Oregon (Ellison et al. 2003; Death Penalty Information Center, 2008). Furthermore, although there are some notable exceptions, rates of most violent crimes tend to be lower in the less religious states and higher in the most religious states (United States Census Bureau, 2006). Finally, of the top 50 safest cities in the world, nearly all are in relatively non-religious countries, and of the eight cities within the United States that make the safest-city list, nearly all are located in the least religious regions of the country (Mercer Survey, 2008).So I'm going to wrap this up for now with a map of religiosity around the World [6].And I'm going to note that if I have to concede a small dip in suicides (which may be a good thing), Pro will have to concede a far higher increase in murder rates... even if the effects were matched 1-1, is the World a better place if one less person commits suicide but one more person gets murdered?  I'll leave that for the gentle voter to decide!  I know this: I'd rather commit suicide than be murdered.Kudos to Pro for keeping this on a dry statistical level so far, but your statistics could do with a bit more weight and a lot more geographical diversity!</t>

    <t>I'll start by thanking Pro for an intelligent and thought-provoking debate.  I'm a little sad that it'll all be over in the blink of another eye and would enjoy another debate with Pro on a related (or non-related) subject.  Kudos; keep it real!I've got to squeeze a lot into this last round, so apologies for brevity in some areas that could easily suffer greater scrutiny.  I've also left myself less than an hour to post this last round; and I'm tired and a little groggy from the Bank Holiday in the UK that finished yesterday (it's 6:30 AM here), so, again, apologies if this round lacks the focus and impartiality that it properly deserves.Whilst Pro nobly concedes that it's almost impossible to argue against a belief being bad, as opposed to an action, I must admit that by my own professed standards of evidence, it's not really fair for me to try to win too much ground on the basis of beliefs without evidence of how those beliefs translate to measurable actions; however, I do beg the gentle reader consider some beliefs: for a start, I beg the gentle voter consider whether a more sinister reality than merely belief must necessarily follow (even if we cannot easily measure the effect) from a significant group of people believing that gruesome death is an appropriate punishment for non-conformance to a set of metaphysical beliefs.  I precisely share Pro's sentiment when she says of the statistics about this belief 'I must say I find them rather concerning'.Pro says that the Psalms are poems that should be given poetic license; Pro says that Deuteronomy contains prescriptions for other people; Pro suggests that much of the Old Testament represents an old covenant that is null and void. Pro suggests that the Jewish consensus is the rather contradictory position that stoning to death is moral but should not be practiced. Pro suggests that we should not tar religions with the same brush as we might use for extremists.  I ask: 'and what, exactly, is an extremist'?  I feel that Pro, like most Christians I know, is a sensible, rational, kind and intelligent force for good in this World. Most religious people are moderate and sensible and kind and good.  I don't (unlike some of them) attribute their goodness to their religion... in fact, I believe that most people I know are sensible, rational, kind and intelligent and a force for good in this World (and I believe that there's good reason why natural selection through group selection made us that way); religion's effect is hard to measure but from my personal experience, religion never does what it claims (makes people kinder or more moral).The idea that Psalms can be undermined by the attribution of poetic licence (not treated literally) will offend a certain number of Christians; are they extremists?  The idea that Deuteronomy should be seen as applying to others will likewise offend a certain number of Christians; are they extremists? The idea that the Old Testament is somehow 'null and void' because of the 'new covenant' is not biblically supportable (in fact, Jesus is quoted as saying that he comes not to change the [Mosaic] law) and will offend a significant number of Christians; are they extremists?I have met Christians on this site who are quite happy to cite the bible as sufficient justification for the idea that homosexual acts are a sin (whilst using sophistry to distance themselves from the Bible's pro-slavery stance); I've also met Christians on this site who take the view that slavery may well be moral because the Bible seems to be for it... are they extremists?  I know this: families are literally torn apart because a son is gay; that sentence needs correction: families are literally torn apart because they are religious; homosexuality is not a choice, religion is.I'd like to know what Pro thinks about Christians who consider the bible to be inerrant and the literal word of God: are they extremists? If a person believes the story of Adam and Eve literally, believes the story of Noah's Ark, believes that Jonah was swallowed by a big fish, believes that atheists are fools that do no good, believes that it's moral and appropriate to stone children to death for disobedience to their parents... are they extremists?  I've met people on this site who literally stand for bringing back stoning-to-death because the bible prescribes it... are they extremists?  Does their existence or, more properly, do their beliefs not demonstrate the responsibility that religion has for making the World a worse place?I'd like to focus the gentle reader's attention to the fact of James Inhofe.  He is currently, for the second time, Chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Environment.  I have absolutely no idea what he believes (although he often waxes lyrical about it); what worries me, in the context of this debate, is that a man can win political points in America for coming out publically and saying such completely ****ing stupid things as he does [1].  I beg Pro and the gentle reader to really listen to what James Inhofe has to say.James Inhofe is potentially the most powerful man on Earth in terms of setting policy regarding man-made climate change, limiting carbon emissions, limiting agricultral chemical run-off, pollution, etc... and he says that there's no such thing as man-made climate change and he seems to think that Bronze Age texts (specifically the book of Genesis) prove that fact.  What's worse is that he uses Romans 1:25 to peddle the idea that any climate campaigners are essentially working for the devil by worshipping false gods (worshipping the creation not the creator).The Catholic church peddle the idea that condoms are universally wicked; the result of this is absolutely, specifically and directly that innocent men women and children suffer horribly and die because of the unnecessary spread of AIDS in Africa [2].  I blame religion for this effect; are you with me?  I say that it is a far greater offence that the largest organised religion on Earth preaches things that directly cause the suffering and death of my innocent and powerless human brothers and sisters than it would be for a married African man to occassionally rubber-up and sleep with a prostitute on the way home from work (much as I, like the religious, question the morality of this action).Religious belief, I charge, causes one to have certain opinions on issues such as gentically modified crops (how could you believe in a creator of all life and not be profoundly worried by the idea of mankind having the hubris to tinker with that?).  I don't say that GM is universally good... indeed, there are atheistic scientists who urge caution about some aspects of the GM debate; what I do claim, though, is that religion predisposes you to lean a certain way... and, like the Catholic church with sex, condoms and AIDS, this leaning literally causes the suffering and death of significant numbers of innocent men, women and children every year.  In this case, Golden Rice [3][4] could prevent suffering, blindness, illness and death by preventing Vitamin A deficiency.  And we are talking about the lives of tens of millions of human beings every year.It is a natural inclination to believe that a human being who thinks that there is a big sky-daddy watching their every move will behave more morally; it is all of our gut reactions (even atheists) to think that anybody who fears eternal suffering will limit their own bad actions... and yet, in reality, murder rates are not obviously negatively correlated (quite the opposite) with religiosity.  Furthermore, there is good evidence to support the idea that religious beliefs cause palpable damage in the World.  I urge the gentle voter to find against the motion; religion, contrary to our instinctive assumptions and religion's own claims about itself, does not the World a better place make!If you don't do it for me, do it for our grandchildren's environment that James Inhofe is happy to see damaged; do it for the millions of innocent men, women and children who die in Africa every year from AIDS or Vitamin A deficiency: vote Con!I have thoroughly enjoyed this debate and have come to have a lot of respect for Pro; however, I charge that Pro has not provided sufficient evidence of any positive effect of religion that could matter as much as the profound negative consequences that I hope I have demonstrated it has.  I beg the reader remember that we are debating a World-wide issue that includes not only your own personal religion but all religions.  And I remind the voter that I do understand that most religious people are decent human beings who make the World a better place; that was not the issue under scrutiny; the idea here is: would those people be as good without religion?  I charge that they would... how about we all (perhaps arrogantly) accept credit for our own decency and stop attributing our worth to our metaphysical beliefs?  Or, if you're not happy accepting credit for your own decency, attribute it to the wonderous marvel of group selection; I know that I do!</t>

    <t>Thank you, Pro, for admitting the weakness in your Round 1 statistics.  They suffer from being small-scale and geographically centralised.When you say: 'I would have liked to cite being in physical journals or books, which I am obviously unable to provide links to (and I hardly expect Con or the voters to rush out and buy them to determine their information's reliability)', you do me an injustice.  I am rational and fair-minded enough to actually want to know if I'm wrong.  Therefore I ask that you at least list the sources which you have which have obviously convinced you of the truth of the proposition.  I may well purchase access to an academic paper or buy a book (I may even prove to you that I have done so).  I don't want to believe wrong things!When you say 'most of the research on the topic of religion's correlation with better health (which is, in itself, a fairly young area of study) comes from the United States' and 'there is so far a paucity of resources as far as the world at large is concerned' then you are implicitly agreeing that the jury is still out on the question, so you can hardly claim it as a point to you in this debate.  Don't believe things without sufficient evidence, please; if you do, please don't expect the rest of us to share your opinions.'I can endeavour to find studies with more representative subject pools should Con request it' - please do so.It is true that we have to be careful how we interpret brute data.  I could have started by citing some very strong statistics that link religiosity with murder rates all over the World.  All over the World.  At any scale... religious regions have more murder, religious countries have more murder, religious continents have more murder.  Murder and religion are heavily correlated.  This does not, as Pro so rightly reminds us, imply causation.  Nobody should be saying that these statistics simply mean that 'religion causes murder'; that would be a grave error in interpretation.  But what's the alternative to this fallacious reasoning?  What is the underlying story that causes both murder and religion?  Perhaps it's poverty... perhaps it's political instability... perhaps it's violence.  Indeed, those three things are correlated with both murder and religion.  It's interesting to note, is it not, that religion thrives in hard times?  If one were being frightfully cynical, one might make a statement such as 'religion finds it easier to get its claws into the young, the old, the weak, the poor, the sick, the dying and the disenfranchised'.It upset me to read 'Zuckerman's broad-brushing of the issue smacks much more of bias than science'.  I did not attack the bias of Pro's sources, although well I might have done.  I withheld from such an attack without solid evidence.  I ask Pro to explain what evidence he has of Zuckerman's bias.  I have studied the report in detail and find, if anything, an admirable lack of bias.'When considering these kinds of statistics on a global scale, there are too many factors involved. One cannot take the stance of 'all things being equal.''Well put, Pro, well put.  It is very tricky to draw the right conclusions when studying something so complex as causation of effects in human society.  We must always remember exactly what questions we are seeking to ask, and we must be open to some explanations that put our statistics in a different light.Quite so, quite so.Here's a confounding factor: religions often (from their high horses of claimed love for all) preach against atheists.  Atheism is a moral wickedness, in many religions' eyes; indeed, false belief is really bad.  If we look at the Bronze Age writings that form the core of certain Abrahamic faiths, we find that the right thing to do to people who believe in the wrong God is to stone them to death.  Nice, that, isn't it, for religions that claim to be peace-loving, tolerant, modern and enlightened?Let me remind the gentle audience of what the bible has to say about that:Psalm 14:1The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.”  -  They are corrupt, they do abominable deeds,  -  there is none who does good.Deuteronomy 13:6-9If your brother, your mother’s son, or your son or daughter, or the wife you cherish, or your friend who is as your own soul, entice you secretly, saying, ‘Let us go and serve other gods’ (whom neither you nor your fathers have known, of the gods of the peoples who are around you, near you or far from you, from one end of the earth to the other end),  you shall not yield to him or listen to him; and your eye shall not pity him, nor shall you spare or conceal him.  But you shall surely kill him; your hand shall be first against him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.(An enquiring reader might also read Deuteronomy 17:2-5)Bear in mind that there are people who believe that the bible is the literal Word of God and is inerrant and infallible.Either way, it remains true that some once-religious people who 'come out' as atheists lose their friends, their families and their jobs (especially in America).  Now, would it not be fair to factor this kind of effect into any discussion on the effects of religion?  I mean, if people lived longer and happier as part of a Mafia group in a certain region because of the effects of that Mafia on non-members, should we conclude that the group makes the World a better place?  I should think not!Thus I suggest that the fairest thing we should be doing is comparing countries that are mostly atheistic to countries that are mostly theistic to get an impartial assessment without conflicting effects.  This has the added bonused of beating potentially biased surveys and including very large numbers of people in the mix... this produces accuracy.  I invite Pro to raise the debate to this level.  I note with joy that Pro's second link does exactly this: it makes the case that poverty causes religion.  Now, it's interesting reading, and it asks us a new question: is it true that religion alleviates the depravations of extreme poverty?  I assume that Pro thinks that it does (I do not) but I invite Pro to address this more interesting question.Pro says 'Zuckerman's article mentions that the most religious states, such as Alabama and Louisiana, have the highest rates of murder. They also tend to have high rates of gun ownership and lax laws [5]' - again, I ask: please could we get to the beating heart of the issue by asking what the reason is for a correllation between gun ownership and religion; or lax laws and religion?  What's really going on?I couldn't find a nice description of the raw facts on the internet, so I've composed my own, based on the most populous countries in the World (gt;100,000,000 people).  I include population, degree of religiosity and intentional homicide rate (per 100,000 people per year)China (1.4 billion) - 41% religious - murder rate 1India (1.3 billion) - 84% religious - murder rate 3.5US (0.32 billion) - 66% religious - murder rate 4.7Indonesia (0.26 billion) - 81% religious - murder rate 0.6Brazil (0.20 billion) - 92% religious - murder rate 25Pakistan (0.19 billion) - 98% religious - murder rate 7.7Nigeria (0.18 billion) - 98% religious - murder rate 20Bangladesh (0.16 billion) - 99% religious - murder rate 2.7Russia (0.15 billion) - 58% religious - murder rate 9.2Japan (0.13 billion) - 29% religious - murder rate 0.3Mexico (0.12 billion) - 56% religious - murder rate 21.5Philippines (0.10 billion) - 95% religious - murder rate 8.8As you can see, there is a positive correlation between religiosity and murder rate.  Now, I am not making the fallacy of jumping straight to 'therefore religion causes murder' - what I am saying, though, is that if you want to be sure that 'religion makes the World a better place', you've got an awful lot of work to do explaining why it seems to be the other way around.In Nigeria, half the Muslim community agree with the death penalty for leaving Islam and there are regions with strict apostasy laws.In Pakistan, 64% of the population want the death penalty for converting from Islam [1].In Bangladesh, it's a much more tolerant 36% of people who think that men, women and children should be killed for non-belief [1].If you add up the populations of Pakistan and Bangladesh, you get more than the population of the US.  Looking at these people, about 50% are convinced that it is the morally correct thing to do to kill people who lose their faith.  I don't think that you can fairly ignore these facts when asking 'does religion make the World a better place?'.[1] I am going to use the next round to further the case that religion, in fact, makes the World a worse place.  I will use Round 5 for summing up and final rebuttals.  I just thought that I'd give Pro a chance to focus a little more globally before I brought the big guns out :)</t>
<h>    Indeed, those three things are correlated with both murder and religion.</h>

    <t>Once again, my apologies for my prior forfeit. Thanks to Con's generosity in giving me some extra time to respond, I've been able to examine their argument a little more completely. Having done so, I find myself in the interesting position of having to defend the specific beliefs, as opposed to the practices, of Islam—a religion I do not personally subscribe to—and given some of Con's sources, I admit that I'm not sure I'm able to. I was not aware of the statistics regarding the acceptance of stoning apostates in Islam, and I must say I find them rather concerning. I am not familiar enough with the Koran to determine whether this sort of devotion to Sharia law is justified in the text, or whether it counts as extremism, so I can't comment one way or the other. If this concession is enough to lose me the debate, then fair enough; I truly can't defend it.However, the Psalms are poems, meaning that vivid imagery and anecdotal descriptions should be expected, and as far as the verses from Deuteronomy cited by Con, they speak specifically of apostasy within the nation of Israel based on their covenant with God, not seeking out nonbelievers from other nations, which seems to be what a lot of people assume. This covenant is null and void in the Christian faith due to the sacrifice of Christ, and as far as Judaism is concerned, the general consensus is that while the death penalty may be moral in theory, it should not be put into practice (not to mention that the standards of evidence required to even convict a “guilty” person are so steep that it's virtually impossible anyway) [1]. Additionally, if a Christian makes grand proclaimations about the bible's commands to love one's neighbor before marching off to hate their neighbors, I'm not sure the blame for that lies with religion so much as human hypocrisy.It's definitely true that atheists have been mistreated by religious people on the basis of their nonbelief, but it's very much incorrect to assume that those discovered to be religious aren't similarly mocked, abused, and discriminated against by atheists (although less frequently, I imagine, given atheism's comparatively small demographic). The rise of the movement dubbed “New Atheism” seems to operate on a platform that the religious deserve to be treated this way.Con asks 'is it true that religion alleviates the depravations of extreme poverty? I assume that Pro thinks that it does (I do not) but I invite Pro to address this more interesting question.” Admittedly, I'm not sure what Con means by this. The source I provided seems to make a good case for religion having a positive effect on those suffering poverty, and as Con has not explained what leads them to believe otherwise, I can't be sure what point they intended me to address. The circumstances of extreme poverty? Its causes? Its effects? On a personal level, or a societal one? Con suggests that “It's interesting to note, is it not, that religion thrives in hard times? If one were being frightfully cynical, one might make a statement such as 'religion finds it easier to get its claws into the young, the old, the weak, the poor, the sick, the dying and the disenfranchised.'” One may very well make such a statement, as it certainly bears to be considered. But one may also appeal to the words of Jesus Christ and note that “it is not the healthy that need a doctor, but the sick.” The disenfranchised have more reason to wonder if an ultimate justice will be served than those who are privileged. The old and the dying have more reason to wonder what comes after death than those who have decades left. The poor and the sick have more reason to seek miraculous help than those who aren't suffering. Maybe religion finds the downtrodden because they're the ones actively looking for the answers it provides.In the same vein of frightful cynicism, however, one might suggest that atheism finds it easier to get its respective claws into those who refuse to bend the knee to any authority besides themselves—after all, if there's no God, what authority could be higher than one's own? This would certainly serve as an explanation as to why so many regimes marked by unspeakable violence and bloodshed at the hands of their governments in the last century or so have been spearheaded by avowed atheists (the usual suspects being Josef Stalin, Mao Tse-Tung, and Pol Pot, but let's not forget Enver Hoxha, Fidel Castro, Mengistu, Mussolini, and Kim Il-Sung, among others). And while we're asking questions, can people who reject religion's gods, and nonetheless cling to the greater part of their moralities (a concept condemned by Nietzsche, and more recently, Michael Onfray) even claim their moral opinions as secular in the first place?As far as my claim about Zuckerman's bias, I didn't intend for it to be quite as harsh as it was apparently received. The way that he presented his statistics (at least to me) read as though Zuckerman was encouraging his readers to conclude that religion causes murder without any attempt at elaboration, which we have both agreed is not a fair assessment to make off-handedly with only the brute data.Con's chart of religiosity and murder rates doesn't seem to be accounting for Eastern Religions. If I'm not mistaken, Shinto is the dominant belief system in Japan, and China has a large number of Taoists. As for the rest, I would hold that extreme poverty, illegal drug and gang activity, and low human development would account for the violence in most of the countries listed, and that religious belief could easily result from the effects of that violence, as stated above. That seems to me like it would be sufficient to explain the correlation.However, one question I think is central to this debate is at what point, exactly, could we count the benefits of religion as greater than its sins? Does the number of lives saved by religious altruism make up for the lives lost to religious extremism, for instance? And can religious extremism be considered true religion, since its actions (in every case I'm aware of) go directly against the teachings it claims to espouse?I'm afraid I ran out of time to locate better-rounded sources as requested, but I would suggest acquisition of the Handbook of Religion and Health from Oxford Press for a collection of meta-studies on the correlation of religiosity and quality of life.</t>
<h>    Having done so, I find myself in the interesting position of having to defend the specific beliefs, as opposed to the practices, of Islam—a religion I do not personally subscribe to—and given some of Con's sources, I admit that I'm not sure I'm able to.</h>

    <t>I freely admit that my sources for Round 1 are less than ideal. Given that I have the burden of proof in this scenario, I didn't want to start things off by waxing philosophical. However, I found myself rather hampered in the sources I was able to provide due to much of the information I would have liked to cite being in physical journals or books, which I am obviously unable to provide links to (and I hardly expect Con or the voters to rush out and buy them to determine their information's reliability).Additionally, most of the research on the topic of religion's correlation with better health (which is, in itself, a fairly young area of study) comes from the United States. I recognize that this debate is focused on a global scale, but as there is so far a paucity of resources as far as the world at large is concerned, I hoped that my opponent would at least consider American statistics to be worth considering. If so, I can endeavour to find studies with more representative subject pools should Con request it. If not, I am more than happy to move on to a different argument. I will leave that up to my opponent.I would like to begin by commenting on Con's argument about the crime rates of religious countries. An interesting feature of the globe's most religious countries is that many of them are in the developing world. Nations such as Mali, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Côte d'Ivoire, and Senegal, for instance, all marked in dark reds on Con's map of religiosity, are included in the Nations Online Project's list of countries with the poorest human development [1] (and, while it may be tempting to conclude from this that religion causes poverty, it's actually the other way around [2]).Even in more affluent places like Europe, the statistic doesn't stand across the board. Eurostat reports: “Homicides are most prevalent in the Baltic States: Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. However, they are relatively rare in some southern EU countries (Malta, Italy, Spain) and Austria, Norway, Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden [3].” Interestingly, Estonia boasts the lowest number of religious adherents, whereas Malta has the highest [4]. Italy, Austria and Switzerland also have high levels of religiosity and low levels of atheism.I could also mention that Vietnam subscribes to state atheism and has massive numbers of non-believers—as well as significant issues with human rights.So let's take it down a peg further and look at the United States. Zuckerman's article mentions that the most religious states, such as Alabama and Louisiana, have the highest rates of murder. They also tend to have high rates of gun ownership and lax laws [5], which has been shown to correlate with higher rates of overall homicide in addition to gun deaths [6]. This could also serve as an explanation for why the United States has higher homicide rates than less religious countries such as Canada and Britain, where gun ownership is much more heavily restricted.In short, I would like to direct the readers' attention to what is known as the False Cause Fallacy, summed up nicely in the adage of “correlation does not imply causation.” Zuckerman's broad-brushing of the issue smacks much more of bias than science. If Con beseeches the reader to consider additional reasons for the correlation of atheism and suicide, I believe I have the right to request the same considerations for religiosity and murder rates. When considering these kinds of statistics on a global scale, there are too many factors involved. One cannot take the stance of “all things being equal.”As far as the “fewer atheists in prison” argument, there are a couple of problems. According to [7] (which seems to be the only place to list the findings of Golumbaski's original study, cited in Zuckerman's article), the religion of approximately 20% of inmates is unknown. That's a significant margin, and it could conceivably be composed of anything from no atheists to all atheists. Perhaps these “unknowns” refused to answer (which would raise the question of why), but perhaps they are non-believers who simply chose to tick the “other” box as opposed to the “atheist” one. We don't know. Additionally, these statistics do not account for conversions. We don't know how many atheists there were going in vs. coming out. Prison ministries are surprisingly common, and it's conceivable that there is a large percentage of people who come to faith in prison. As far as Con's points on suicide (ignoring my sources for the time being), I consider it to be vastly different from euthanasia as far as the ethics and complexity of the issue. The idea that 'suicide may not be universally bad' is a point I would certainly stand to disagree with, but euthanasia is a different story. However, this is not the debate at hand, so I hope that we won't get too caught up in it. I would also note that Con's comment that 'the idea that suicide is universally unacceptable seems to me an artefact of religion,' while perhaps partially true, is somewhat nearsighted. It bears remembering that even if suicide is in the best interests of the subject in question, it is very rarely in the best interests of their loved ones. The idea of suicide being universally unacceptable seems like a fairly understandable response to the pain and grief suffered by the victim's family and friends. After all, suicide victims do not have the luxury of explaining their reasoning. Even if religion had not played a part in the debate, it's possible that we would have drawn the same conclusions either way.</t>

    <t>Thanks Pro for the opening arguments.Preface: - It should be noted that Pro’s Resolution is specific about eradicating poverty, not just reducing it. - Beside the utter lack of sources amp; support for his arguments, Pro has yet to argue for the eradication of poverty, as affirmed in his resolution. Case: I. Causes of Poverty: - Poverty, like ignorance amp; corruption, is a human condition entrenched in all societies past amp; present for it stems from causes that are inherent in the human psyche amp; rooted in the environment we live in. For brevity purposes we will limit the said causes to some of the more relevant ones: 1. Corruption: factor that makes it easy for the wealthy amp; authority to get richer at the expense of the poor, for there is a lock of higher authority to check the flow of wealth amp; thus the rules turn in favour of the fittest at the expense of the weakest [1]. Even Humanitarian Aid from rich countries (such as the US) to poor countries (such as sub-Saharan Africa) is damaged by corruption [2]. 2. Climate Change: a condition generally beyond human control: some areas have stable climate suitable for cultivating land, harvest amp; nurturing livestock, some others suffer from extreme unstable environments, heat, soil, rain. . . that disrupts the sustenance necessary for local populations, which in its turn creates amp; may even perpetuate Poverty.    3. Wars: a state of affairs that drains resources, human amp; economic, amp; destroys the socioeconomic structures that generate amp; distribute wealth, which also creates Poverty amp; prevent possible solution from being implemented to solve it. amp; wars are, too, a human condition existing as long as humans exist. 4. Natural Disasters: floods, volcanos, tsunamis, epidemics, earthquakes. . . all contribute in destroying both wealth amp; the structure that might preserve it. Cause that can not be eradicated, not by any human means. II. Reduction of Poverty vs Eradication of Poverty: - Pro’s contentions are almost all for the reduction of poverty, not for its eradication. Pro must provide a way through which the roots of Poverty can be eliminated for good, that if he wishes to support his resolution. - Furthermore, even in case a particular society was seemingly successful in eliminating poverty with itself, that would not imply its automatic success in eradicating it. That is because such achievements are contingent to a very specific circumstances of time amp; place amp; overall socioeconomic situation unlikely, even impossible, to form a perpetual state.  Rebuttals: - The only argument provided by Pro seemingly supporting his resolution, that is eradicating Poverty as opposed to suppressing it, is the following: “The argument that we have not ended poverty yet is not an argument that it can't ever be done.”  - I certainly do not agree, for the above statement is inductively false. If, so far, we haven’t been able to end Poverty, then, inductively, that’s a good reason to believe that we never will. Believing there is a chance to end Poverty for good warrants, at the very least, as good a counter-argument as the above pure inductive argument is. An anology could be made with the following example: 1. So far the sun rises from the east. 2. The sun tomorrow will rise from the east. 3. The sun tomorrow will rise from the west. =gt; (1) is a fact ; (2) is inductively true, i.e certain. =gt; (3) is inductively false. Therefore, believing (3) to be true necessitate a serious argument strong enough to trump pure inductive reasoning! Hence my position.  Conclusion:  As I established throughout my round, eradicating Poverty isn’t simply rationally unjustified, for the statement “Poverty can be eradicated in the future” is inductively false, it is also amp; more importantly utterly hopeless, for Poverty is rooted in inunshakeable physical amp; mental realities, both internal amp; external, outside human influence.</t>

    <t>Rebuttals:the fact we have reduced it puts us in a better position to be able to eradicate the remaining poverty. There is a relatively small number left to help (in some countries) making it more manageable- Pro’s proposition here is invalid, for:1. It’s a straw man fallacy! Arguing for reducing poverty does not help the case of eradicating it!2. His assumptions are grossly inaccurate: 1.1 billion people have inadequate access to water, 2.6 billion lack basic sanitation, 1.6 billion live without electricity, 1 in ever 2 children is in poverty. Poverty is very much rampant, unmanageable should be the more adequate word to describe it [1].Every invention could have easily been dismissed as not possible because it had not happened in the thousands of years before.- Pro is confusing argument from ignorance [2] with inductive reasoning [3].1. Every raven, so far, is black. Therefore, all ravens are black. =gt; This is an inductive argument.2. Every unicorn, so far, is cute. Therefore, all unicorns are cute. =gt; This is a argument from ignorance.=gt; In (1) we have a positive factual claim, as in supported by real evidence, whereas in (2) we have no real evidence.=gt; So far, poverty exists. Therefore, poverty always exists.Corruption is responsible for a relatively small share of the illicit money flow from developing countries.- Pro’s contention here is invalid, for:1. It’s a bare assertion, unsupported by his own source: “multinational companies steal more than $900bn from developing countries each year through tax evasion and other illicit practices.”2. Corruption, political or moral, is indeed one of major causes of poverty. Internally, it pushes Man into becoming ever greedy, thus not only does it prevent them from sharing wealth (i.e. preventing the reduction of Poverty) but it also initiates Poverty by compelling them to appropriate the wealth of others. Externally, it allows for even more lack of sharing amp; wrongful appropriation, thus a perpetual disparity of wealth: “In 1960, the 20% of the world’s people in the richest countries had 30 times the income of the poorest 20%, in 1997, 74 times as much”, “0.13% of the world’s population controlled 25% of the world’s financial assets in 2004” [1].- Also, corruption being in constant change is not reason enough to believe it can be eradicated! The world can counter the negative impacts of nature.- Countering the negative impacts does not imply eradicating them. Natural disasters have far reaching economic consequences [4]. Katrina for instance cost $108Bn amp; left hundreds of thousands unemployed [5], amp; millions homeless [6].Wars are becoming less frequent and deadly.- Again, bare assertion amp; non-supportive to Pro’s resolution, for:1. Less wars does not imply no more wars!2. Throughout history we had long periods of peace, amp; also long periods of war, successively. Such as WWI amp; WWII followed by the declaration of the UN [7].3. Currently, the World’s military expenditure amounts to 2.3% of its GDP ($1776Bn) [8].=gt; Wars cause poverty, prevents its reduction amp; there is no reason to believe they can ever be eradicated.If […] the past is a good indicator of the future then those countries are looking good for the future.- Countries having had some success in a relatively short historical period (one century or less), does not imply they will have the same success perpetually! No civilisation has ever always stayed on top.Conclusion:- Pro’s entire case is a series of  bare assertions amp; straw man. He argues for reducing poverty amp; extrapolates to eradicating it! His sources are either non-existent or non-supportive. His arguments are contradicted by the facts. He has thus thoroughly failed to carry his BOP. Thus I win the debate.=gt; Vote Con.</t>

    <t>Hello,  I respectfully disagree that I focused on reducing it instead of eradication. I made the specific point that the fact we have reduced it puts us in a better position to be able to eradicate the remaining poverty. There is a relatively small number left to help (in some countries) making it more manageable hopefully and we have a successful foundation to build on. (Being the lessons learnt about what works).  I apologize for only referencing the organizations that I got my information from instead of specific links to each fact. (I have included them this time} I did mention the sources of information though in my last post and searching their sites will produce the info for those interested). I would also say the rebuttal to my statement that just because it has not been eradicated yet is not a strong one. Every invention and medical breakthrough in the 20th century could have easily been dismissed as not possible because it had not happened in the thousands of years before the 20th century.  Corruption is responsible for a relatively small share of the illicit money flow from developing countries. It also does not account for most of the poverty in rich countries. Unemployment, underemployment and low pay play much bigger roles there. There are also mechanisms to reduce corruption like Partnership in Transparency Fund {a charity}. Corruption itself does not mean the money that does make it can not work. Foreign aid still has plenty of success stories. The varying corruption rates across the globe and the changing list of most corrupt countries indicates that corruption is not some unchangeable part of nature but changes based on changeable factors  Blaming global warning and natural disasters for poverty is unfair. No doubt it makes things worse for farmers but there is a reason why Australia had the worse drought in 100 years and it did not result in mass starvation and death. It is not just about nature. The world can counter the negative impacts of nature. GMO crops are one way to partly protect against nature. Drought-resistant crops for example. The Commission for Africa although noting global warning is a problem for development pointed out many more man made issues like the need for storage facilities. Irrigation of land and the like.  Professor Steve Pinker notes that wars are becoming less frequent and deadly. We have also had times of relative peace like Pax Romana. Historians have also noted that war has not always occurred since the start of history. And countries like Switzerland and the pacifism movement demonstrates to me that war is not some inherent part of human nature that can't ever be changed.  I argue that no strong case has been made that, 'inunshakeable physical and mental realities..' mean that we can't see the end to poverty. Con makes a good point that just because something is possible now does not mean that might be the case in the future. I would argue there are already countries that have had decades of relatively low poverty and if Con's argument is that the past is a good indicator of the future {aka because we have not ended poverty in the past means...} then those countries are looking good for the future.  Full-time employment {that pays well} is one of the best ways to keep people out of poverty and as long as the government {or international community} can afford to pay for full-employment public works programs then there is a strong case that poverty could always stay gone. Mechanisms already exist to ensure long-term funding for programs. Sovereign wealth funds and compulsory superannuation funds as some examples. </t>

    <t>Thanks for accepting the debate. I will try my best.  We know that we can significantly reduce poverty because there are countries that have done it like Norway and Denmark. So I would argue that ending the relatively low amount of remaining poverty is not beyond possibility. {The money to do it is definitively there in the case of Norway. Norway has a sovereign wealth fund in the hundreds of billions that could be used to directly give every poor person in Norway enough money to have a socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions}.  We know that countries like America have been able to drive the poverty rate down by a significant margin. {Take during the early days of the war on poverty}. So again I would make the argument that a country could build on that by doing things already proved by independent evaluators to be effective. Critical time-intervention to tackle homelessness, expanding the nurse-family partnership and career academies as examples. {Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy has info on these programs}.  We know the sums of money to provide food is relatively affordable {for governments or business}. The cost of school meals for kids in developing countries for example is within the billions a year and not the hundreds of billions. {According to the World Food Programme}. We know there is enough food to go around according to hunger charities so it is not about there not being enough food in the world or resources of governments to pay for that food that sees people in the world going without an adequate amount of food. The argument that we have not ended poverty yet is not an argument that it can't ever be done.  So for me this shows that we can/it is possible to end poverty and to ensure it does not come back.  I would argue there is enough evidence to show the world would be a better place without poverty. The impact that poverty has on the bottom-line. The Centre for American Progress estimates that childhood poverty alone in the US costs about 500 billion a year. Poverty is an underlying cause of human trafficking according to the United Nations. It is the underlying cause of a significant amount of bad health outcomes in America and around the world. {The latter according to the World Health Organization}. It is a cause of low educational achievement because poor kids are less likely to do well in school because of poverty. These are just some of the problems. So I would argue this shows why it would be a good thing to eradicate poverty.</t>

    <t>Contention 1: No Major/any CO2 Increase.      Many Global Warming advocates state that CO2 levels are skyrocketing, but that is incorrect. I give you the above graph measuring the past 600 million years of CO2 levels are we are actually at an all time low. Now the website I got this from no longer has this page up so I appologize. We can see from observance of this graph that we being at all time CO2 low levles that we are nowhere close to meeting the impact that my opponent brings up. We have been over 5,000 ppm of CO2 in our atmosphere and are now currently around apprx. 350 ppm CO2 levels.  The above graph shows that comparisions of C13 (Carbon isotope) and this shows that there is little to no trend pertrade in many of these as the average is zero while the trend for all of these are zero. (1) This is important as the Carbon isotope is important in measuring this so called 'Global Warming.'  This chart above shows the CO2 and Earth's temperatures for the past 600 million years. My opponent's claims are incorect as we have had aburd levels of CO2 and temperature on Earth and may I ask how did we survive that? (2) Now I will move on to how Earth is actually cooling and how it's temperature is cooler than it has been. Contention 2: Earth is cooling.  If we observe the above graph we can see that Earth has been a whole lot hotter than where we currently are to the point where the Earth's average temperature has been 7.5 degrees Celcuis hotter than it currently it is. You can also see that in the span of the past 10,000 years the temperature has leveld off, but you may ask yourself where does that place us in the lights of modern day?  I am going to site Dr. Done Easterbrook, who is a climate scientist. Back in 2000 he predicted that Earth was entering a cooling phase. He predicts that for the next 20 years Earth will cool by 3/10 degree each year and that we are going to enter another little Ice Age like we did from 1650 and 1790. (3) The funny thing is that many of my opponent's charts are actually from the incorrect IPPC. How about the 'Hockey Stick' graph that many Global Warming supporters , including my opponent, argue about? Well if we observe the fallowing chart taken from Northern Scandenavia we can see that the Global trend over the past 1,000 years that the Global Cooling trend slope is that of -0.31 Degrees Celcuis, give or take 0.03 degrees (for the error room). Professor Dr. Jan Esper has found that the Earth's temperature of Earth actually decreases 0.3 per millenia due to the Earth moving away from the sun. (4)   Here is another graph from 1920 to 2005 and we can see that the graph has a negative temperature slope, thus meaning that the Earth is under a period of cooling. (5)  You can see in terms of more Warming in the evidence in which Scientists use Ice Cores Earth has actually been Cooling the past Mellenium.  Finailly, lets bring up just how much these accused compounds exactly warm the Earth's atmosphere. CO2 for example has the global warming potential of 1. Here are the other numbers. Carbon Dioxide -- 1Methane -- 21Nitrous Oxide -- 298-310CFC's -- VariousWater Vapor -- 0.25 Now I just want you to keep this in mind for this next part here. We may observe that humans release approximately 35 gigatons of CO2 a year. [14] This is only 4.3% of the total amount of all Global Warming Gasses, however it is incrediably small when it comes to comparing the rest of the Global Warming gasses. If we observe the chart bellow we can see that Water Vapor is a large Contributor to Global Warming at 95% and CO2 comes in second. But here's the kicker. If we look at the Human contributed part that I'm about to post in the graph bellow we can see that it's very miniscule of 0.117% of all total Warming gasses. Now let's do some quick math here. CO2's increase was from what my opponent is claiming is from 295 ppm to 400ppm, a total of only 105 ppm. 1 Gigaton of CO2 is the equilivent of 2.13 ppm. [15] This means that increase of 105 ppm means a total of 49.29 gigatons. Since 1 gigaton of CO2 is the equivilance of .004% of the Greenhouse effect that means that 49.29 gigatons means an aditional .21% increase to Global Warming. This would account for a grand total of a 0.15 F increase in global temperature. This is a very measly amount and we can see that with my opponent's claims a simple 0.15 F increase isn't enough to melt glacers and have the effeccts that he is speaking of and it proves that this is NAUTRAL not man-made to fulfil his effects if they were real. Now remind yourself that this debate is about humans creating a LARGE amount of Global Warming, not a miniscule amount. You can see that in terms of Gasses contribution to the Green House Effect the major contributer is Water Vapor and it's at 95% to CO2's 3.6% and this is the overall contribution including man made and natural. When we look to the chart on the left we can see that Man-Made CO2 does have a higher contribution to the atmosphere than Water Vapor, but that's because we do not create much water vapor as humans. Even with this evidence we can see that CO2 does not have any effect what-so-ever compared to Water Vapor. (6) Where might those CFCs be on this graph you may ask. Why it's under the Misc. gases section. Contention 3: Artic Ice. Al Gore stated that the Artic Ice would be completely melted by 2014, but he is incorrect then and now.  Jan. 6, 2012: The Coast Guard Cutter Healy breaks ice around the Russian-flagged tanker Renda 250 miles south of Nome. The Healy is the Coast Guard’s only currently operating polar icebreaker. The vessels are transiting through ice up to five-feet thick in this area. The 370-foot tanker Renda will have to go through more than 300 miles of sea ice to get to Nome, a city of about 3,500 people on the western Alaska coastline that did not get its last pre-winter fuel delivery because of a massive storm. (7) Let's go back to 2007-2008 and see if his claim was justified in the Artic Ice activity.  Hmmm... It seems that he is incorrect, but let's look further into the near past. How about 2012-2013? (8) We all remember the Climate Scientists that got stuck in Arctic Ice Earlier last year correct? Then a Russian Ice Breaker tried to free them, but got stuck. Can you guess what they were studying? They had predicted that all the Arctic Ice had melted due to Global Warming and that Earth would get flooded massively. Boy were they wrong. (9)  (10)  Dr. Koonin, former head of the Department of Energy under President Obama, has stated that the Global Warming scare is not suttle. This is because that he has found 3 things wrong and highly incorrect about the scare. 1. Shrinking of Artic Sea ice doesn't acount for the gaining of the Antartic ice. 2. The warming of Earth's temps today is the same as it was 30 years ago. 3. The sea levels rose at the same height and rate in the 20th cenury. (11) Contention 4: Sea Levels Here is another corralation that must happen. If the Ice Caps are completely melted as many GW advocates claim then the sea level would have risen completely drowning tons of land.  The graph above is raw satellite image data of the sea level rise over an 8 year period showing that there is little to no change in the Sea Levels rising. (12) The sea level rises, on average, about 3 inches per century and it has been found to not even been rising at all.  This graph is the sea levels off the cost of French Guyana which is one of the areas which is predicted to be flooded due to Global Warming, but as you can see by the graph (which goes to 2008) the sea level is currently on a downward trend. (13) The source is the PDF within the link.Contention 5: The WeatherMany Global Warming Advocates claim that Hurricanes are increasing due to Global Warming, but this claim is indeed false! The hurricanes since the year 1900 to 2008 have actually been decreasing. The slope of this downward slope is .0016. Though it is small the hurricanes are still in a downward trend.As a matter of fact not only are Hurricanes on a downward trend, but they are at an all time low as in the year 2010, there was only 68 Hurricanes Globally, which is an all time low in the past 40 years. How about Tornados you may ask?In the graph above you can see that tornados are at an all time low in the past 60 years! (14) But what about Hurricanes?Here is a graph showing the number of days between hurricanes and this shows that the number of days between hurricanes is greatest at 76 days between hurricanes.The slope of this line is zero showing no trend of a massive storm increase. </t>
<h>    The above graph shows that comparisions of C13 (Carbon isotope) and this shows that there is little to no trend pertrade in many of these as the average is zero while the trend for all of these are zero.</h>

    <t>I would like to thank lannan13 for posting his arguments.No Major CO2 IncreaseThis is true. CO2 levels have been higher. But what were the climactic conditions during those periods? 'The last time carbon dioxide levels were apparently as high as they are today - and were sustained at those levels - global temperatures were 5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit higher than they are today, the sea level was approximately 75 to 120 feet higher than today, there was no permanent sea ice cap in the Arctic and very little ice on Antarctica and Greenland.' Clearly, the levels that CO2 is reaching are unsustainable.[1]The reason the CO2 rise is considered high is because the CO2 level is the highest in around 50 million years. And it only took 150 years to get that way. So, while the CO2 level is not as high as it has been, the climate was much warmer then, and the CO2 rise is large in the large scale.CO2/Temperature CorrelationCO2 does not correlate exactly with temperature. However, if we consider CO2 and the sun, the correlation is almost perfect. The sun has not caused the most recent spurt of global warming, so it must be concluded that the rising CO2 levels are causing global warming.[2][3]The graph below shows the two forcings plotted against temperature:Further, my opponent's correlation graph is inaccurate. It forgets the huge uncertainty early on.This graph shows the uncertainty:With this uncertainty, Robert Berner (the author of the study and graph), said himself, 'Eexact values of CO2... should not be taken literally.' That correlation graph should not be taken seriously. The better one is the first graph above, that shows that CO2 has a big effect on the climate. Berner also said in the same study, '...over the long term there is indeed a correlation between CO2 and paleotemperature...'[4][5]The Earth's Current Climactic TrendMy opponent's studies are based on faulty data sets and misunderstandings about how the climate works. Different data sets show the Earth is warming, and the Earth's climactic indicators show that the Earth is still warming.For one thing, my opponent's temperature graphs are based off of RSS data. UAH and HADCRUT4 data both show that the Earth has been continuing to warm throughout the last 15 years.[6][7] For another, it was found that the heat content of the Earth is increasing. 'This new research combines measurements of oceanheat, land and atmosphere warming and ice melting to find that our climate system continued to accumulate heat through to 2008... Since 1970, the Earth's heat content has been rising at a rate of 6 x 10^21 Joules per year.' If you look back to my first round, you'll see my point that excess CO2 traps heat, and this is exactly what we're seeing[8][9]:Further, if we focus on surface and lower troposphere temperatures (just where we'd expect there to be warming), we see that the warming trend continues. 'Foster and Rahmstorf (2011) used multiple linear regression to filter out the effects of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and solar and volcanic activity (Figure 2), and found that the underlying global surface and lower atmospherewarming trends have remained very steady in recent years.'[8][10]:The hockey stick continues to stick because there's no evidence that there were any periods for at least the last 2500 years that indicate that the climate was warmer then than it is now. The hockey stick was been replicated numerous times. This graph still appears to be the real story when it comes to the recent climate[11]:Interestingly, my opponent's 'Greenland GISP2 Ice Core - Temperature last 10,000 years' graph cuts off at 1850.[12]Water VaporMy opponent is correct that water vapor is the most important greenhouse gas. However, water vapor only acts as an amplifier of other warming. Water vapor levels can't be raised. However, since CO2 levels can, the warming that follows is amplified by water vapor in the atmosphere. In other words, it's a positive feedback (see my first argument), not a cause of warming in and of itself.[13]Arctic Ice LevelsThe claim that the arctic sea ice would be completely gone was an apocalyptic one that did not turn out to be true. However, it is still known that the levels of sea ice are decreasing. See the below graph:'The blue line represents the trend calculated from January 1 1979 to the most recent date indicated on the figure. Monthly averaged ice volume for September 2014 was 6,970 km. This value is 40% lower than the mean over this period, 59% lower than the maximum in 1979, and 0.7 standard deviations above the 1979-2013 trend.' The arctic sea ice levels are decreasing.[14]As for the Antarctic sea ice claim, while the sea ice is gaining in extent, it is decreasing in mass. This is the result of a complex set of scenarios.[15]This graph shows the loss in Antarctic ice mass:[16]The claim that the temperature are warming at the same rate doesn't change the fact that increasing CO2 levels are behind the warming. As for the claim that arctic sea ice levels are rising at the same level, this is blatantly false, as the graph below shows:[17]Sea LevelsIt is true that the sea ice melting portends rising sea levels. However, the sea level is actually increasing. Looking at the sea level for an eight year period hardly shows a long-term trend, especially when there's variation in the climate. The sea level rise in French Guiana would not have inundated the country. Further, there's also variation in the sea level rise in different places.When the global data is analyzed, a clear trend of sea level rise is seen. 'To construct a global historical record of sea levels, tide gauge records are taken from locations away from plate boundaries and subject to little isostatic rebound. This has been done in A 20th century acceleration in global sea-level rise (Church 2006) which reconstructs global sea level rise from tide gauges across the globe.'[18][19]:What can be seen is that the sea levels are rising, and that the increase is accelerating. Relying on isolated events and short-term trends does not answer the question of whether sea levels are rising as a whole globally.The WeatherThe correlation between global warming and weather is much more complex than my opponent gives the anthropogenic global warming theory credit for. For one thing, storms rely on many more variables than just temperature, especially tornadoes. 'Then there are problems unique to tornadoes. Beyond knowing that they require a certain type of wind shear, meteorologists just don’t know much about why some thunderstorms generate tornadoes and others don’t.' If we don't understand why certain thunderstorms create tornadoes, then we are in no place to analyze the correlation between tornadoes and one variable. We simply just don't know enough yet here.[20]Hurricanes can be better analyzed, because they are more dependent on ocean temperatures than tornadoes are on land temperatures. Higher temperatures won't necessarily lead to more hurricanes, but they will lead to stronger hurricanes. 'The Power Dissipation Index is found to increase since the mid-1970s, due to both longer and more intense storms. Hurricane intensity is also highly correlated with sea surface temperature. This suggests that future warming will lead to an increase in the destructive potential of tropical hurricanes.'[21][22]The below graph shows this:The correlation is clear here. Further, it was found that while the number of lower-intensity hurricanes has stayed about the same, the number of higher-intensity hurricanes has increased for this very reason. The greater number of hurricanes seen would be small, considering most hurricanes are lower-intensity.[23]SourcesSources in comments.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank lannan13 for accepting this debate.Human-Emitted Greenhouse GasesIt is known that CO2 levels are increasing. 'In pre-industrial times over the last 10,000 years, CO2 was relatively stable at around 275 to 285 parts per million. Over the last 250 years, atmospheric CO2 levels have increased by about 100 parts per million.' CO2 levels are increasing at a level not seen in at least 500,000 years, if not longer.[1]Here is a graph showing CO2 concentrations over the last 10000 years:[2][3]This excess CO2 traps heat. Satellites measure less heat escaping out to space, at the particular wavelengths that CO2 absorbs heat, thus finding '...direct experimental evidence for a significant increase in the Earth's greenhouse effect.' In other words, the Earth is retaining more of the heat that it receives from the sun that it received from before. This excess heat manifests itself through global temperature increases.[4]'If less heat is escaping to space, where is it going? Back to the Earth's surface. Surface measurements confirm this, observing more downward infrared radiation. A closer look at the downward radiation finds moreheat returning at CO2 wavelengths, leadin to the conclusion that '...this experimental data should effectively end the argument by skeptics that no experimental evidence exists for the connection between greenhouse gas increases in the atmosphere and global warming.''[5][6]CO2 correlates with temperature. Consider the Cenozoic era (the last 65 million years). Overall, solar activity increased 0.4% over this period. 'Because Earth absorbs about 240 W/m^2 of solar energy, that brightness increase is a forcing of about 1 W/m^2. This small linear increase of forcing, by itself, would have caused a modest global warming through the Cenozoic Era.' The CO2 levels caused a much higher forcing. In contrast, atmospheric CO2 during the Cenozoic changed from at least 1000 ppm in the early Cenozoic to as small as 170 ppm during recent ice ages. The resulting climate forcing, as can be computed accurately for this CO2 range using formulae in Table 1 of Hansen et al. (2000), exceeds 10 W/m^2. It is clear that CO2 was the dominant climate forcing in the Cenozoic.'[7]In fact, the temperature changes correspond to the CO2 changes. '...there is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr.'[8]This graph shows the CO2-temperature correlation over the last 700,000 years:Indeed, it would be rather coincidental if the recent rise in global warming happened to start just around the time that humans started to emit large quantities of greenhouse gases. However, there is direct evidence as well, in addition to the already established correlation between temperature and CO2.One piece of evidence is a comparison of warming in the troposphere and stratosphere. Because the CO2 is in the upper troposphere, the troposphere temperature would increase, while the stratospheric temperature would decrease, because there would be less heat reaching the stratosphere. 'Computer model estimates of the ‘human influence’ fingerprint are broadly similar to the observed pattern. In sharp contrast, model simulations of internal and total natural variability cannot produce the same sustained, large-scale warming of the troposphere and cooling of the stratosphere.'[9][10]This graph shows this:[5]Another piece of evidence is the frequency of cold days and nights. Because the sun only shines in the day time, is the sun was causing global warming, the days would warm faster than the nights, while if greenhouse gases were causing global warming, this wouldn't be observed. It is the latter's prediction that is observed. 'What we observe is a decrease in cold nights greater than the decrease in cold days, and an increase in warm nights greater than the increase in warm days.'[5][11]This can be shown in the below graph:[5]Overall, the evidence shows that human-emitted greenhouse gases are the cause of global warming. CO2, in addition to other gases like methane and nitrous oxide are being emitted by humans in very large amounts, and this is manifesting itself in an increase in the average global temperature.Climate Sensitivity and FeedbacksClimate sensitivity is the amount the temperature would rise if the CO2 concentration were doubled. Obviously, if there's a large climate sensitivity, then increases in CO2 have large effect. It is known that the climate sensitivity is around 1 degree C. However, this can be amplified through feedbacks. Positive ones amplify the sensitivity, while negative ones diminish the sensitivity. The evidence overwhelmingly comes down on the former, that positive feedbacks are happening. Increases in CO2 cause temperature increases, which are amplified by water vapor and the effect on clouds.'Since the radiative effects associated with the buildup of water vapor to near-saturation levels and the subsequent condensation into clouds are far stronger than the equilibrium level of radiative forcing by the non-condensing GHGs, this results in large local fluctuations in temperature about the global equilibrium value.'[12]This can be shown in the below graph:Further, increases in CO2 affect the carbon cycle in this way:Global warming can result in the death of vegetation (due to droughts) and the warming of the ocean. Both of these further reduce the maximum absorption of the Earths carbon cycle, thus resulting in even more CO2 being released into the atmosphere. And with this, CO2 increases even more. In other words, CO2-caused temperature increases are amplified by positive feedbacks and the mechanics of the carbon cycle.So, the positive feedback amplifies the climate sensitivity. How much it is amplified can be determined through study. Using a Bayesian statistical approach, which is “the dominant [method] in the literature”, these findings support the notion of climate sensitivity as maximum 4 degrees C, a mean of 3 degrees C, and likely not lower than 3 degrees.[13]The graph below gives a statistical analysis:[14]The mean is around 3 degrees C.  The CO2 that humans emit thus has an effect of 3 degrees C per doubling of CO2. This can be shown by the fact that CO2 concentrations have increased from around 275 ppm to around 400 ppm. This is an increase of around 40%. This should manifest itself with a temperature increase of a little less than 1.5 degrees C. Indeed, temperatures have increased around this amount over the last 150 years. The anthropogenic-forcing climate models thus match observations.[15]In other words, in addition to the direct evidence of how the Earth is warming, the climate models based on a greenhouse gas cause to global warming explain almost perfectly the recent global warming. This is a lot of evidence for a human case to the recent global warming.ConclusionGreenhouse gases cause global warming because of their heat trapping abilities. Humans have been emitting vast amounts of greenhouse gases over the last 150 years, and this shows itself on the CO2 measurements. The atmospheric warming pattern and greater heating at night are evidence that the recent global warming is caused by those human emitted greenhouse gases. These increases are amplified through the water vapor and cloud positive feedbacks and the positive feedback that arises through the climate cycle. The climate sensitivity ends up being around 3 degrees C. Finally, the CO2-temperature record shows that the two correlate with remarkable correlation.SourcesSources in comments.</t>

    <t>There are some minor issues in conduct with my opponent's constructive case, but I'm not going to dwell on them. Primarily, this argument remains unaltered from when my opponent last debated this issue, which means he has left in irrelevant rebuttals, albeit to the wrong opponent.R1: No Major/any CO2 Increase.In the previous round, I preemptively refuted this first claim that historically higher carbon dioxide are relevant. In fact, as you will see, they are, if anything, evidence in favour of carbon dioxide's effect on temperature, which Con later attempts to refute.'Many skeptics claim that historically, carbon dioxide levels have been much lower, particularly around 500-600 million years ago[1]. But the carbon dioxide level is not the only factor that affect global temperature[2]. Additionally, this position fails to account for the differences in solar activity, that was drastically different from current levels. This position also fails to explain why a comprehensive analysis of carbon dioxide levels over the last 540 millions years concluded that 'Periods of low CO2 coincide with periods of geographically widespread ice.' This is clearly visible in this graph, where the shaded periods are periods of widespread ice.'[3]I shall also strengthen this argument and adapt it to Con's specific contention.Firstly Con cites data, which no longer exists. This is bad practice. He should seek alternative data that supports his contention that, even if one assumes the data is reliable, I have unequivocally refuted. Earth is cooling.This is patently not true and in most instances of my opponents argument, a bare assertion. In the others, he has cherry picked unsupported evidence. Of course the Earth has been hotter historically (due to solar activity), but this is irrelevant. In this debate we are referring to Global Warming, which is the consistent rise in temperature since the 20th century up till this point, which is clearly occurring. This figure shows the change in the earth's total heat content since 1960[1]. This more advanced graph is the average of 5 different data sets, adjusted for the short-term effects of the El Nino Southern Oscillation, solar variability, and volcanic aerosols[2].Con then proceeds to [sic]site Don Easterbrook, who claims his model predicted the temperature more accurately than the IPCC. This is an outright falsehood. In fact, Easterbrook had to distort the IPCC projection figures to make his graph compelling. Here is the actual data[3]:We see that the IPCC's projections were much more accurate. Shall we zoom in a bit more?Con then cites his first actual study, despite it being relatively insignificant, as it is a single study and has a largely negligent effect on the hockey stick graph. I'm now going to provide some consistent and substantiated data regarding the hockey stick graph.The hockey stick is describes a sharp increase in temperature visible within a reconstruction of temperatures in the last 1000 years. The original paper describing this trend appeared in 1998,but since then there has been a number of notable proxy studies that have confirmed its findings[4][5][6]. In 2007 an independent study reconstructed largely similar results, and evaluated the statistical techniques employed to create it[7]: Con's own graph was constructed from unknown data sets, presumably by NewsBusters, a questionable source (given their clear bias in documenting the issue). His next graph is also cited the same source, despite that graph not existing anywhere on the source page. I have no obligation to rebut something that has been pulled from thin air and not substantiated with fact, especially in supposedly scientific debates like this one.In his next argument, pertaining to water vapour, Con shows elementary misunderstanding of climate sensitivity and feedback. His argument can be summed up in the following format:P1: Water vapor makes up 95% of greenhouse gases and CO2 only . (Bare assertion)P2: The climate sensitivity of water vapour is around 0.25%. The climate sensitivity of CO2 is around 1%. (Disputable and unsourced, my Constructive Case hinted at a slightly higher figure between 2 and 4.5 degrees)P3: Global warming is occurring. (A sudden change of heart)C1: Water vapour is responsible for global warming,Before I begin tearing this nonsense apart I'd like to urge voters to hold Con accountable for changing advocacy half way through his case (in the same contention!). He first contends that there is no warming, and then holds that there is warming, only that water vapour is responsible. We aren't going to have quality discourse if Con does not hold a stable position.Con fails to understand that weak warming caused by more carbon dioxide will lead to more water vapor in the atmosphere, which will then amplify the weak warming through water vapor’s role as the atmosphere’s primary greenhouse gas. Water vapour is responsible for much of the greenhouse effect, but only because warmer air masses, on average, contain more water vapor. In short, water vapour acts a feedback, not a forcing[10]. Much of his further case was also preemptively rebutted in my initial constructive case: 'Despite man made carbon dioxide emissions being comparatively smaller than natural emissions, the real driving force of climate change is the net quantity of carbon dioxide released, since most natural carbon emissions are absorbed[8]. Because of this, atmospheric carbon dioxide is at the highest levels in approximately 15 to 20 million years. R3:A single, self-described proponent of climate change being wrong, on a single instance, has no relevance to the ultimate scientific validity of climate change. This is hardly worth rebutting. Can we move discussion to the science, rather than people, and badly reported news stories?R4:Con argues that sea level rise has not occurred and cites Mörner, whose work has consistently been discredited by the organisations that he claims to represent:'Mörner claims that the 'true experts' think this data is wrong (emphasis added):  'The world’s true experts on sea level are to be found at the INQUA (International Union for Quaternary Research) commission on Sea Level Changes and Coastal Evolution (of which I am a former president), not at the IPCC. Our research is what the climate lobby might call an ‘inconvenient truth’: it shows that sea levels have been oscillating close to the present level for the last three centuries. This is not due to melting glaciers: sea levels are affected by a great many factors, such as the speed at which the earth rotates. They rose in the order of 10 to 11cm between 1850 and 1940, stopped rising or maybe even fell a little until 1970, and have remained roughly flat ever since.'  This is quite different from the INQUA official position on climate change, which opens by saying (emphasis added):  Climate change is realThere is now strong evidence that significant global warming is occurring. The evidence comes from direct measurements of rising surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures and, indirectly, from increases in average global sea levels, retreating glaciers, and changes in many physical and biological systems. It is very likely that most of the observed increase in global temperatures since the mid-twentieth century is due to human-induced increases in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere (IPCC 2007).' [1]  Unfortunately ounces up and down slightly from year to year so it's possible to cherry-pick data falsely suggesting the overall trend is flat, falling or linear. Credible sources will all display sea level averages over the long term. Here is a study done by the University of Colorado [2]: It shows a clear trend in sea level movement since 1995. Another study, analysing global mean sea level from 1870 through 2006 determined another clear trend. R5: Con has not provided a single relevant source, which, quite frankly, in an entirely statistical and scientific argument, is unacceptable. I cannot rebut imaginary data. Next round, please provide valid sources and explain their relevance, and I will take delight in rebutting them,ConclusionMuch of Con's argument has been founded on bare assertions and comprehensive misinterpretations of climate science. I have rebutted all his sourced claims, and hopefully cleared up much of his misunderstanding in regard to climate feedback.Onto the next round. Good luck, Con.</t>

    <t>Contention 1: No Major/any CO2 Increase.      Many Global Warming advocates state that CO2 levels are skyrocketing, but that is incorrect. I give you the above graph measuring the past 600 million years of CO2 levels are we are actually at an all time low. Now the website I got this from no longer has this page up so I appologize. We can see from observance of this graph that we being at all time CO2 low levles that we are nowhere close to meeting the impact that my opponent brings up. We have been over 5,000 ppm of CO2 in our atmosphere and are now currently around apprx. 350 ppm CO2 levels.  The above graph shows that comparisions of C13 (Carbon isotope) and this shows that there is little to no trend pertrade in many of these as the average is zero while the trend for all of these are zero. (1) This is important as the Carbon isotope is important in measuring this so called 'Global Warming.'  This chart above shows the CO2 and Earth's temperatures for the past 600 million years. My opponent's claims are incorect as we have had aburd levels of CO2 and temperature on Earth and may I ask how did we survive that? (2) Now I will move on to how Earth is actually cooling and how it's temperature is cooler than it has been. Contention 2: Earth is cooling.  If we observe the above graph we can see that Earth has been a whole lot hotter than where we currently are to the point where the Earth's average temperature has been 7.5 degrees Celcuis hotter than it currently it is. You can also see that in the span of the past 10,000 years the temperature has leveld off, but you may ask yourself where does that place us in the lights of modern day?  I am going to site Dr. Done Easterbrook, who is a climate scientist. Back in 2000 he predicted that Earth was entering a cooling phase. He predicts that for the next 20 years Earth will cool by 3/10 degree each year and that we are going to enter another little Ice Age like we did from 1650 and 1790. (3) The funny thing is that many of my opponent's charts are actually from the incorrect IPPC. How about the 'Hockey Stick' graph that many Global Warming supporters , including my opponent, argue about? Well if we observe the fallowing chart taken from Northern Scandenavia we can see that the Global trend over the past 1,000 years that the Global Cooling trend slope is that of -0.31 Degrees Celcuis, give or take 0.03 degrees (for the error room). Professor Dr. Jan Esper has found that the Earth's temperature of Earth actually decreases 0.3 per millenia due to the Earth moving away from the sun. (4)   Here is another graph from 1920 to 2005 and we can see that the graph has a negative temperature slope, thus meaning that the Earth is under a period of cooling. (5)  You can see in terms of more Warming in the evidence in which Scientists use Ice Cores Earth has actually been Cooling the past Mellenium.  Finailly, lets bring up just how much these accused compounds exactly warm the Earth's atmosphere. CO2 for example has the global warming potential of 1. Here are the other numbers. Carbon Dioxide -- 1Methane -- 21Nitrous Oxide -- 298-310CFC's -- VariousWater Vapor -- 0.25  Now I just want you to keep this in mind for this next part here. We may observe that humans release approximately 35 gigatons of CO2 a year. [14] This is only 4.3% of the total amount of all Global Warming Gasses, however it is incrediably small when it comes to comparing the rest of the Global Warming gasses. If we observe the chart bellow we can see that Water Vapor is a large Contributor to Global Warming at 95% and CO2 comes in second. But here's the kicker. If we look at the Human contributed part that I'm about to post in the graph bellow we can see that it's very miniscule of 0.117% of all total Warming gasses. Now let's do some quick math here. CO2's increase was from what my opponent is claiming is from 295 ppm to 400ppm, a total of only 105 ppm. 1 Gigaton of CO2 is the equilivent of 2.13 ppm. [15] This means that increase of 105 ppm means a total of 49.29 gigatons. Since 1 gigaton of CO2 is the equivilance of .004% of the Greenhouse effect that means that 49.29 gigatons means an aditional .21% increase to Global Warming. This would account for a grand total of a 0.15 F increase in global temperature. This is a very measly amount and we can see that with my opponent's claims a simple 0.15 F increase isn't enough to melt glacers and have the effeccts that he is speaking of and it proves that this is NAUTRAL not man-made to fulfil his effects if they were real. Now remind yourself that this debate is about humans creating a LARGE amount of Global Warming, not a miniscule amount. You can see that in terms of Gasses contribution to the Green House Effect the major contributer is Water Vapor and it's at 95% to CO2's 3.6% and this is the overall contribution including man made and natural. When we look to the chart on the left we can see that Man-Made CO2 does have a higher contribution to the atmosphere than Water Vapor, but that's because we do not create much water vapor as humans. Even with this evidence we can see that CO2 does not have any effect what-so-ever compared to Water Vapor. (6) Where might those CFCs be on this graph you may ask. Why it's under the Misc. gases section. Contention 3: Artic Ice. Al Gore stated that the Artic Ice would be completely melted by 2014, but he is incorrect then and now.  Jan. 6, 2012: The Coast Guard Cutter Healy breaks ice around the Russian-flagged tanker Renda 250 miles south of Nome. The Healy is the Coast Guard’s only currently operating polar icebreaker. The vessels are transiting through ice up to five-feet thick in this area. The 370-foot tanker Renda will have to go through more than 300 miles of sea ice to get to Nome, a city of about 3,500 people on the western Alaska coastline that did not get its last pre-winter fuel delivery because of a massive storm. (7) Let's go back to 2007-2008 and see if his claim was justified in the Artic Ice activity.  Hmmm... It seems that he is incorrect, but let's look further into the near past. How about 2012-2013? (8) We all remember the Climate Scientists that got stuck in Arctic Ice Earlier last year correct? Then a Russian Ice Breaker tried to free them, but got stuck. Can you guess what they were studying? They had predicted that all the Arctic Ice had melted due to Global Warming and that Earth would get flooded massively. Boy were they wrong. (9)  (10)  Dr. Koonin, former head of the Department of Energy under President Obama, has stated that the Global Warming scare is not suttle. This is because that he has found 3 things wrong and highly incorrect about the scare. 1. Shrinking of Artic Sea ice doesn't acount for the gaining of the Antartic ice. 2. The warming of Earth's temps today is the same as it was 30 years ago. 3. The sea levels rose at the same height and rate in the 20th cenury. (11)  Contention 4: Sea Levels Here is another corralation that must happen. If the Ice Caps are completely melted as many GW advocates claim then the sea level would have risen completely drowning tons of land.  The graph above is raw satellite image data of the sea level rise over an 8 year period showing that there is little to no change in the Sea Levels rising. (12) The sea level rises, on average, about 3 inches per century and it has been found to not even been rising at all.  This graph is the sea levels off the cost of French Guyana which is one of the areas which is predicted to be flooded due to Global Warming, but as you can see by the graph (which goes to 2008) the sea level is currently on a downward trend. (13) The source is the PDF within the link.Contention 5: The WeatherMany Global Warming Advocates claim that Hurricanes are increasing due to Global Warming, but this claim is indeed false! The hurricanes since the year 1900 to 2008 have actually been decreasing. The slope of this downward slope is .0016. Though it is small the hurricanes are still in a downward trend.As a matter of fact not only are Hurricanes on a downward trend, but they are at an all time low as in the year 2010, there was only 68 Hurricanes Globally, which is an all time low in the past 40 years. How about Tornados you may ask?In the graph above you can see that tornados are at an all time low in the past 60 years! (14) But what about Hurricanes?Here is a graph showing the number of days between hurricanes and this shows that the number of days between hurricanes is greatest at 76 days between hurricanes.The slope of this line is zero showing no trend of a massive storm increase. </t>

    <t>Contention 1: No major/any CO2 IncreaseFirstly I would like to point out a huge drop from my last round. This was my just how much of each of the Green House Gasses actually contribute and how much of them actually are from man made. Let's run those percentages one more time. Water Vapor---0.001%CO2---0.117%Methane---0.066%N2O---0.047%Misc. (including CFCs)---0.047%We can see here that these percentages are indeed quite low and this was dropped by my opponent so I extend them across the board.     Let us observe the above graph. Here I would like to point out the that the increase from Pre-Inustrial to Industrial era and the doubling of the CO2 leveling lead to a decrease in it's temperature. Also we can see that the 10 mile 'hot-spot' above the tropics is actually absent. 'The computer models show that greenhouse warming will cause a hot-spot at an altitude between 8 and 12 km over the tropics between 30 N and 30 S. The temperature at this hot-spot is projected to increase at a rate of two to three times faster than at the surface. However, the Hadley Centre's real-world plot of radiosonde temperature observations shown below does not show the projected CO2 induced global warming hot-spot at all. The predicted hot-spot is entirely absent from the observational record. This shows that atmosphere warming theory programmed into climate models are wrong.' [1]If we observe the above Greenland Ice Core we can see that though it's been heating up we can swee that on average it's a whole lot colder than what it is on a normal basis. This is also acknowledging that humans have only been around in the past 10,000 years or so we can see that this Ice Core is still colder than normal even with the emmission that are produced today. Now if we observe the above graph of the past 400,000 yeasrs we can see that the CO2 rates in our atmosphere has flutated the exact same way in this cycle both before and during the existance of human beings. We can see that the temperatures and CO2 levels have been going up and down randomly for the past 100 thousands years and it is observed that this occured before the industrial revolution. We can also see that right now we are in a warming period so that arguing that humans are because of this is post hoc. Not to mention that we are in the coldest of the warming periods in Earth's history! Hence this reveals that this whole Global Warming is just a cycle that Earth is expierencing. We can see that once again despite contrary to belief we can see that though there may be warming the fact is simply that there is no human warming.I also appologize for using evidence that has expired. Could you tell me which one and I'll post it in the comments section. Thanks. Contention 2: Earth is Cooling  You're probably asking yourself, why am I seeing this graph again? This is because the more CO2 we get the less warming there is. If we observe this graph we can see that the Warming has decreased with more CO2 that we've recieved. This shows that CO2 doesn't have that much of an impact on the tempterature like the math that I've proved it in my last contention. [2]  Now I will agree that Eastbrook isn't good with predicting temperature change, but the IPCC is even worse, but whatever is causing the change it is highly unlikely that it's man made. Once again we can see that the IPCC and Al Gore are inccorect as the hocky stick graph is a bust. As I've shown in earlier rounds and they have been dropped in showing that the Earth's temperature has indeed been way hotter then current and on an average basis at that. My opponent has also dropped my opening graph in C1 r2 That also showed that CO2 levels are at an all time low! Thus once again disproving my opponent's theory.Here we can see that even though CO2 levels are increaseing that the temperature in recent years has actually decreased on the linear scale. Also the US Senate Committe on Envirnment and public works also took a stab at this issue. They found that the Hocky Stick graph was also bogus in 2006. “Today’s NAS report reaffirms what I have been saying all along, that Mann's ‘hockey stick’ is broken,”Senator Inhofe said.“Today’s report refutes Mann's prior assertions that there was no Medieval Warm Period or Little Ice Age.” “This report shows that the planet warmed for about 200 years prior to the industrial age, when we were coming out of the depths of the Little Ice Age where harsh winters froze the Thames and caused untold deaths. “Trying to prove man-made global warming by comparing the well-known fact that today's temperatures are warmer than during the Little Ice Age is akin to comparing summer to winter to show a catastrophic temperature trend.” [3]Here we can see that they've found that this warming of the similiar to what my opponent is trying to prove is actually indeed bogus. Paleoclimate scientist Bob Carter had shown through his research at University of East Angila in the United Kingdom that the Climate Change increase had actually froze from 1998-2006 showing that this so called Global Warming had actually stopped. [4]  My opponent tries to claim that I am a hypocrate, but he is yet twisting my own words. I'm showing that there's none if not barely little warming and that Water Vapor is a key part of it. He fails to see that I showed that how much water vapor is when I showed the equation in my last round in Contention 1, so my opponent's tangent is irrelivant here. Contention 3: Artic Ice and Sea Level.I do appologize. Let me bring up other evidence since my last round apparently wasn't good enough though I sited NASA of all organizations.   THough my opponent likes to blow things out of perportion we can see that these sea levels rise and fall on their own. It's a natural cycle as I showed last round. The trend shows only a mere +/- 0.30 mm per year. 'The Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory estimates the rate of sea level rise at 1.42 plus or minus 0.14 mm/year for the period 1954 to 2003. This is less than the estimate of 1.91 plus or minus 0.14 mm/year for the period 1902 to 1953, indicating a slowing of the rate.' [5] We can see that 2.8 inches per 50 years isn't that much of an appocolyptic threat.  Here is a graph from NOAA which shows that the sea level rise is very small and that the IPCC is way off as well as many other Warming 'experts'. [6]  In the above graph we can see that despit Artic Ice slightly decreasing we can see that it follows the same patern throughout the year as the Ice melts in the summer and freezes in the winter. We can see that my opponents' sea ice level predictions are incorrect. [7] Which if sea ice is decreasing then explain the great sea ice exspansion of Antartica in 2012 shown bellow. It had a total of 20,000 miles more ice than average.  The graph bellow is proof of the cycle of what I'm talking about. Plus even if it was caused by Global Warming my opponent still has to prove that it was caused by HUMANS in order to take the win here not to show that it exists.According studies done by Ola Johannessen we can see that the Greenland Ice Sheet is growing! Also we can see from the same study is that the Artic was actually warmer in the 1930's than today! [8]I also extend across all of my previous arguments for this Contention.Contention 4: Storms  The NOAA has shown that Tornados are less frequent and occur less and less.  [9] I continue to extend across my NOAA Hurricane graph from last round.If we observe the above graph we can see that there is no net increase in violent Hurricanes nor their wind speed. We can see that my includes more years and hence more data which disproves my opponents. Plus when you add in my R2 graph, which was unrefuted, you can see that there is zero if not a decreasing trend when it comes to hurricanes. My graphs are just some imaginary data and I shall extend them all across the board. </t>

    <t>In this debate I'm going to be arguing that Global Warming is anthropogenic.C1: Carbon dioxide causes warmingCarbon dioxide has been identified as having 'greenhouse' qualities for over a century[1]. The greenhouse effect occurs when GHGs allow shortwave solar radiation to pass through the atmosphere. This energy is absorbed of the earth, and then radiates this heat as infrared radiation. This is usually referred to as outgoing longwave radiation. This theory is particularly well-explained in this diagram.This means that a with more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, we should observe lower levels of this longwave radiation escaping into space the the wavelengths carbon dioxide is meant to absorb. This was recorded by the IRIS satellite and later confirmed by the IMG satellite over a 26 year period. The paper concluded that the experiment could be considered 'direct experimental evidence for a significant increase in the Earth's greenhouse effect'[2]. This same experiment has been adapted multiple times in order to measure downward longwave radiation from the ground[3][4]. This empirical evidence is unequivocal.Another way line of empirical reasoning that supports carbon dioxide's effect on the climate is through historic instances of climate change. This paper quantified the equilibrium temperature change in response to radiative forcing change, climate sensitivity, of the pre-anthropogenic eras[5]. The results of this analysis, were consistent with IPCC estimates. A 2 and 4.5°C global surface warming in response to doubled carbon dioxide.Just to really nail the coffin, I'll raise one further argument that determines a net positive feedback, in regard to climate sensitivity: modelling estimates. These work by calculating numerical data and predictions based on the physical, chemical and biological properties of its components, their interactions and feedback processes, and accounting for all or some of its known properties. A notable 2002 paper used a fingerprinting approach on modern temperature records and found a range of approximately 1.4 to 7.7°C [6]. A later model looked at paleontological data over the past 6 centuries to calculates a range 1.5 to 6.2°C [7]. This position is quite literally a platitude in any climate researchers books, since it is so well supported. This will be evident within my scientific consensus contention. C2: Humans are the source of the vast majority of resultant carbon dioxideThis figure shows the estimated balance of carbon dioxide emissions.Despite man made carbon dioxide emissions being comparatively smaller than natural emissions, the real driving force of climate change is the net quantity of carbon dioxide released, since most natural carbon emissions are absorbed[1]. Because of this, atmospheric carbon dioxide is at the highest levels in approximately 15 to 20 million years[2]. Many skeptics claim that historically, carbon dioxide levels have been much lower, particularly around 500-600 million years ago[3]. But the carbon dioxide level is not the only factor that affect global temperature[4]. Additionally, this position fails to account for the differences in solar activity, that was drastically different from current levels. This position also fails to explain why a comprehensive analysis of carbon dioxide levels over the last 540 millions years concluded that 'Periods of low CO2 coincide with periods of geographically widespread ice.' This is clearly visible in this graph, where the shaded periods are periods of widespread ice.Many prominent climate science papers have argued that, if it were not for Natural contributions cooling the climate, we would be, in fact, a little hotter.Net human and natural percent contributions to the observed global surface warming over the past 50-65 years. There is a widespread, comprehensive scientific consensusThe contentions I have argued are not unfounded, flawed or bogus. In fact, they are so convincing that there exists a well-established scientific consensus.A recent survey of 12,000 climate science papers that expressed a position on the cause of global warming found that 97% of them agreed that anthropogenic global warming is occurring[1].The same survey found a historic strengthening of the Pro-AGW consensus since 1990.Another survey of 908 randomly selected climate scientists with more than 20 peer-reviewed publications settled upon a similar figure: '≈97% of self-identified actively publishing climate scientists agree with the tenets of anthropogenic climate change'[2]. My opponent might argue that the majority of papers expressed no position, therefore leaving room for a much weaker scientific consensus. This would fail to account, however, for the fact that the vast majority of papers included had already accepted AGW as a premise. Oreskes predicts this result, arguing that, 'Scientists generally focus their discussions on questions that are still disputed or unanswered rather than on matters about which everyone agrees'. ConclusionI have shown that the climate is sensitive to increased levels of carbon dioxide, and that humans are the source of it. These positions are so well supported that an establish scientific consensus exists.Over to you, Con!</t>

    <t>GHG Ratios: This was not a huge drop. I had previously explained that that 'weak warming caused by more carbon dioxide will lead to more water vapor in the atmosphere, which will then amplify the weak warming through water vapor’s role as the atmosphere’s primary greenhouse gas. Water vapour is responsible for much of the greenhouse effect, but only because warmer air masses, on average, contain more water vapor. In short, water vapour acts a feedback, not a forcing[1]' The quantities are irrelevant of water vapour are irrelevant when my contention regarding climate sensitivity remains unchallenged. Climate sensitivity is the crux of this debate, and if my opponent cannot refute my claims, he has essentially lost.Industrial CO2 Doubling: This next contention is unfounded and a bare assertion, so I'm not going to waste character space rebutting it.Tropospheric Hot Spots: Con then claims that AGW models are invalidated by the lack of a tropospheric hot spot. There is a tropospheric hot spot. [2][3][4] Yet even if there were not, it would not disprove AGW because tropospheric occur regardless of heat source, as they are caused by lapse rates. [5] I.E. If the warming was caused by a brightening sun or reduced sulphate pollution, you'd still see a hot spot. All that the IPCC temperature signature in your source predicted was a greater forcing of temperature.Ice Core Cooling: Once again an unfounded and bare assertion, without any statistical backing. I've shown in my previous contentions that warming is undoubtedly occurring, and those contentions have been dropped.Historic CO2 Fluctuations: It's upsetting that you don't cite any sources, because this could be a good argument. R2: None of this is especially relevant, Con is arguing about how good the IPCC are at forecasting temperature and long term climate sensitivity. I have proven that warming is occurring, and Con has not even touched by arguments. Con concedes Easterbrook was falsified, but then goes on to claim CO2 is at an all time low. As I've previously mentioned: 'Because of this, atmospheric carbon dioxide is at the highest levels in approximately 15 to 20 million years[1]. Many skeptics claim that historically, carbon dioxide levels have been much lower, particularly around 500-600 million years ago[2].

This is not relevant. You have conceded my rebuttals - sea levels are rising. R4:The general consensus on this topic is inconclusive. I really don't see it's relevance. To win this debate, Con should have refuted my claims about and climate sensitivity, that is the crux of debate, and he has failed to do so. Con has consistently struggle to provide coherent positions and reliable evidence throughout the debate. Ultimately, the science is conclusive and much of my initial contentions have been dropped.Vote Pro!</t>
<h>    This position also fails to explain why a comprehensive analysis of carbon dioxide levels over the last 540 millions years concluded that 'Periods of low CO2 coincide with periods of geographically widespread ice.'</h>

    <t>Hey guys ,I will be glad if you read my essay and give me tips how ti improve it .Thankx in advance  Prompt : Is the world changing for the better  The world is changing all the time.Some people think it changes for the better ,while otherr think it worsens.In my opinion , the world around us is becoming better and better.I believe that we should always try to ameliorate our 'own world' ,making the whole world a better place.The subsequent examples from history and literature assert my point of view that our world is always changing and it changes for the better . In 14th century,in Italy began the era of the Renaissance.The new thinking and new ideas superseded the belief that God had created the world and he was everything we should have strived for ,our paragon of virtue.In 1356 a yound woman accidentally discovered male and a famale body in the wood.She was very astute and quite interested in biology and realized thath men and women had the same number of ribs.According to The Bible ,God takes one rib away from women and gives it to men ,in order to make them more powerful than women.Later,this woman became the first person to contravene the mores and ideas of the church ,becoming the first doctor in the world.The Renaissance absolutely changed the view that God was omnipotent and that we were under his authority.This era gave the world writers like Dante and Bocacco ,artists and scientists like Leonardo da Vinci .These people decided to controvert the church and change the world.They made it better !  'The dreamers' is a novel , written by one of the most famous African writers Walter Uanda.The novel is about two brothers who dream of becoming politicians and changing the communistic regime of their country.Inspired by true events,the author recounts how the young boy is killed during a 'peaceful' demonstration by the national army ; twenty years later ,his brother becomes tha first democratic president of the country.The champions the poor and influences smany African countries to stand against communism.He changed the African world for the better .  The world does not change in a constant rate.We choose how to change it ,and it depends on us if it will be changing for the better or for the worse.Since it`s inception ,the Earth has been evolving , and it keeps evolving at the moment ; we all hope it evolves for the better. </t>

    <t>No, the world is not changing for the better. Threat of nuclear destruction, disease, political and religious conflicts, rising terrorist organizations, faltering birthrates in 1st world countries, failing economies, failing American educational system, voter apathy, running out of resources, 'climate change', etc .  As much as we'd might like to believe the world is changing for the better; the harsh reality is that the world is becoming overpopulated, fossil fuels are running low and until we find a replacement we are at risk of loosing precious infrastructure and the effectiveness of supplies. And if we can't get resources over a matter of miles via car then food lines will run thin and we'll have a hard time feeding our people.

    <t>Now, back onto the debate. Thank you, lannan13, for that impressive response. Unfortunately, he has broken the rules by refuting my graphs and data I had put out in round 2:'Round 2: Opening arguments and Constructive Case, NO REBUTTALS' I'm not sure if I should let it slide since this seems like my most fun debate, so that will be up to my opponent. I will first focus on rebuttals, then my contentions. Note that counter-rebuttals are now switched to this round as my opponent refuted my graphs in round 2, thus I must respond to these refutations or otherwise they will be seen as dropped.==Rebuttal 1: No Major/any Co2 increase==My opponent's graph is a graph of Co2 levels over the past 600 million years. In contrast, my graph is a graph on Co2 levels only throughout the past 650,000 years. My opponent's graph shows as time closes in on the present, the Co2 levels grow lower. However that is because we are looking at a much broader timeline and thus can't see all the needed details in the graph. Yes, we are at an all time low, but that doesn't mean Co2 levels aren't increasing [1]:  I would like to point out that global warming doesn't mandate warming all throughout Earth's life. Global Warming happens anytime when Earth's temperature substantially increases, and that is what is happening. If Co2 levels are increasing, mainly due to human activity, and Earth's temperature rises at the same rate at the same time, then we already have good evidence man-made global warming exists.Also, it seems that my opponent uses a graph by Robert Berner. It is known that Berner's studies are very untrustworthy, especially this one. You can see in the following graph that his graph contains many errors [2]:'History of Atmospheric CO2 through geological time (past 550 million years: from Berner, Science,1997)... The shaded area encloses the approximate range of error of the modeling based on sensitivity analysis...' [2]My opponent then goes on to state that man-made global warming (or even global warming on general) does not exist simply because our Earth has been much hotter before, and then asks, 'may I ask how did we survive that?' However this is a fallacy because:1.) I had already stated that global warming does not mandate a warming all throughout Earth's life, and recently it has been increasing, even though if not by as much as older times. Also, under the circumstances, one degree is still quite substantial.2.) We could not survive in those times as the human race had not even come to being, let alone the dinosaur race. Plus, the animals and forms of life during those times were specially adapted to the hot climate. Also, this is irrelevant as we are only debating the existence of man-made global warming, not if we are going to survive it.3.) Because of the sun being dimmer than now, higher Co2 levels would be needed in order to keep the Earth at a bearable temperature, or else the Earth would literally freeze over. This contention is negated.==Rebuttal 2: The Earth is Actually Cooling==Again, I must remind my opponent that global warming does not mandate warming throughout Earth's life. As you can see at the end of the graph, the temperature slightly increases back, thus proving global warming's existence, and, with the previous information I had given, man-made global warming as well. Just because the Earth has been hotter before doesn't mean it isn't warming again.When my opponent puts up his graph on the cooling of early 2000, again this is misleading, and Easterbrook's predictions have gone wrong from the first 10 years of data collected on the graph. Yet my opponent claims the IPCC studies are incorrect, which is untrue. The evidence is here [3]:    “Figure 5: Don Easterbrook's global temperature graphic presented during the 2010 Heartland conference.” Then, down lower on the cited website [3], it is said:  “So while the IPCC TAR projection was too high by about 0.12°C for the reasons discussed above [on cited website], Easterbrook's projections were too low by 0.28°C and 0.58°C. Despite all of these non-greenhouse gas factors acting in the cooling direction over this timeframe, the IPCC projection was still much closer to reality than Easterbrook's.” [3] On my opponent’s next graph, he shows that each millennium the Earth cools down by 0.3 degrees Celsius (0.54 degrees Fahrenheit) due to Earth’s motion away from the Sun. However, the study was conducted only for the last 2 millennia, when most of the millennia were basically Industrial Revolution and modern activity free. The IR started in 1790 [4]. At the end of the graph, the global temperature abruptly rises above the red line even before 2000, thus proving the existence of global warming, and man-made global warming. This is the same for my opponent’s next two graphs. My opponent’s last graph focuses on the contribution of the Greenhouse gases, and states that the contributions are very low. However that does not negate the existence of global warming or man-made global warming, it simply states that global warming is slow and weak. Thus, this contention is negated. ==Rebuttal 3: Arctic Ice and Sea levels== “First, I would like to state that Pro’s claim about the North Pole completely melting is bogus.” Never in this debate did I ever claim that. This is a straw-man. In my opponent’s Arctic Ice graphs, he shows that since nothing has happened to the Arctic Ice Sheet, global warming, and thus man-made global warming, cannot exist. However, again this is a straw-man since he simply takes a single photo for each year (which only shows the ice on a specific date) and then compares them. It is literally subjective to choose the worst of something on an earlier date and compare it with the best of something on a later specific date. For example, you could say that Whitney Houston is bad because she had an off-day, which is completely untrue. Also, although I don’t believe in all Arctic Ice melting, it is melting slowly and gradually [5]:  And here is a graph on gradually rising sea levels, contradicting my opponent’s [6]:    Thus this contention is negated and proved once again man-made global warming exists. ==Rebuttal 4: The Weather== “My opponent is claiming that Hurricanes are increasing due to Global Warming, but this claim is indeed false!” Again, never in the debate have I claimed that. What’s more, hurricanes aren’t actually linked to global warming in general [7]! “Hurricanes aren't linked to global warming “According to the National Hurricane Center, storms are no more intense or frequent worldwide than they have been since 1850. […] Constant 24-7 media coverage of every significant storm worldwide just makes it seem that way.” (Paul Bedard)” [7] The story is similar for tornadoes as well [8]: “Global warming may well end up making them more frequent or intense, as our intuition would tell us. But it might also actually suppress them—the science just isn't clear yet.” [8] Thus, either way, this contention doesn’t contradict anything about the existence of man-made global warming. ==Contention 3: Oceanic Acidification== A large portion of the Co2 emitted by the atmosphere is absorbed into the ocean. The more Co2 that is emitted into the atmosphere, the more is absorbed into the ocean, and thus the more acidified the ocean becomes [9]. This and warmer temperatures generally cause coral bleaching, which has happened more frequently recently due to its relatively narrow habitable temperature range [10].    Ocean acidification has increased by 30% since the Industrial Revolution [11]. This acidification can harm aquatic organisms, of which organisms that do not need oxygen take place and release greenhouse gases like methane, [12] thus proving that man-made global warming exists. ==Conclusion== I have refuted all my opponent’s arguments and have given out major information to support the existence of man-made global warming. Thus, the resolution stands affirmed.</t>
<h>    If Co2 levels are increasing, mainly due to human activity, and Earth's temperature rises at the same rate at the same time, then we already have good evidence man-made global warming exists.</h>

    <t>If this doesn't work, click on the original link and take off the extra space at the end of the link in the URL bar. I actually quoted the wrong part of this website by mistake. I was meant to quote 'It is unclear whether global warming is increasing hurricane frequency but there is increasing evidence that warming increases hurricane intensity.'Also, apologies for writing Carbon Dioxide as Co2 (Cobalt2, as my adversary points out). It's just the way I grew up writing it.Moving on, Counter 1: Co2 and its effects=='Now remind yourself that Pro said in Round 2 that CO2 is responsable for LARGE amount of Global Warming.' - OpponentI'm not sure where I said this. I ask my adversary to quote from me.In fact, my opponent's entire rebuttal for this argument is misleading. It is subjective to use only Co2 as a base for a rebuttal against the resolution. If we were to count all the other causes of the greenhouse effect, then it is very possible to conclude that this can heat Earth by more than just 0.15 degrees Fahrenheit. My opponent even concedes that there is a warming caused by anthropogenic emissions, but then states that it is very low. That isn't what his BoP wants. To fulfill it, he must disprove the entirety of anthropogenic global warming.'Since 1 gigaton of CO2 is the equivilance of .004% of the Greenhouse effect that means that 49.29 gigatons means an aditional .21% increase to Global Warming. This would account for a grand total of a 0.15 F increase in global temperature.' - OpponentNot only have Co2 levels increased, but there are steep increases in other greenhouse gases as well [1]:Be reminded that there is already a correlation between Earth's temperature and Co2 levels, and that the rates of circular cooling and warming, and increase/decrease of Co2 levels have stopped and started to rise severely [2]:We cannot use my opponent's graph which suggests the contrary to the temperatures above, as it only uses data from Georgia [3], a state in the United States of America [4]. There is literally a direct contradiction between my adversary's chart (from 1990, Georgia) and mine (1880, worldwide).Atmospheric concentrations of Co2 and anthropogenic emissions of Co2 have a correlation as well [5]: My opponent then goes on to review a graph on the logarithmic effects of increased carbon dioxide levels. Even if this is true, by my opponent's logic there is still a warming effect. It just gets smaller, but not negative. We can't say that the warming effect is slower to disprove the entirety of anthropogenic global warming, because that is fallacious and invalid, and ends up failing to fulfill the real BoP here.==Counter 2: The earth is actually cooling==People and websites have actually shown the hot-spot absence to be fake. According to Skeptical Science, the absence of the hot-spot could be due to the errors in the processing of data [6]:'Satellite measurements match model results apart from in the tropics. There is uncertainty with the tropic data due to how various teams correct for satellite drift. The U.S. Climate Change Science Program conclude the discrepancy is most likely due to data errors.' - Skeptical Science [6]'Allen and Sherwood sought to side step the problems associated with the radiosonde data entirely, and examined the “dynamical relationship known as the thermal-wind equation, which relates horizontal temperature gradients to wind shear”. Thermal wind speed data, in contrast to the temperature data, lacked many of the systematic adjustment issues and other errors, and were used as a proxy for temperature. Allen and Sherwood found that the troposphere appeared to be warming in reasonable agreement to theoretical and modeling expectations.' - Skeptical Science [6]The IPCC projections are actually considered to be quite accurate, in comparison to both of Easterbrook's projections [7] (animation of both comparisons, then together):'All of the IPCC projections have proven to be quite accurate, suggesting high reliability.  The contrarian projections all underestimate the global warming substantially, and in fact they erroneously predict global cooling and are quite unreliable.' - Skeptical Science [7]==Counter 3: Arctic Ice and Sea Levels==Note that the rise and fall of the data represents sea level CHANGE RATES, not the sea level itself. The majority of the data is above zero, meaning that on average the sea level, even if minimally, is rising.In fact, the sea level rise is actually accelerating quite quickly [8]:'A variety of different measurements find steadily rising sea levels over the past century.' - Skeptical Science [8]'The trend shows only a mere +/- 0.30 mm per year. 'The Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory estimates the rate of sea level rise at 1.42 plus or minus 0.14 mm/year for the period 1954 to 2003. This is less than the estimate of 1.91 plus or minus 0.14 mm/year for the period 1902 to 1953, indicating a slowing of the rate.' [6] We can see that 2.8 inches per 50 years isn't that much of an appocolyptic threat.' - OpponentThis is irrelevant. We are debating whether anthropogenic global warming exists, not if it is dangerous or not. The existence of something  does not mandate an argument of how safe it is.My opponent actually concedes that there is a rise, but again tries to save his stance on the argument by saying that it is minimal, which again isn't the point. By my opponent's logic, if man-made global warming exists, sea levels should not rise at all, to which he has conceded the contrary. Thus my opponent concedes this entire point.Also, although Arctic sea ice extent does follow a pattern, it is still gradually decreasing [9]: Although I will concede the Antarctic ice is expanding, the arctic is losing ice more than twice as fast than the Antarctic is gaining ice [10][11].'Since the late 1970s, the Arctic has lost an average of 20,800 square miles (53,900 square kilometers) of ice a year; the Antarctic has gained an average of 7,300 square miles (18,900 sq km).' - NASA [10]==Counter 4: Hurricanes and Tornadoes==I had already proven that tornadoes are not linked to global warming whatsoever, so this argument has been debunked. The hurricane argument has been re-responded to.To reinforce the fact that hurricanes are getting more intense however, here is a graph showing the increase of more intense hurricanes over time [12]:'Higher surface temperatures of the world's oceans could be responsible for the big rise in the strength of hurricanes, say US scientists.' - Physicsworld.com [12]==Counter 5: Ocean Acidification==Although it is correct that ocean acidification is not yet at a critical level, it is acidifying very rapidly. It is predicted that by 2100 the ocean will have a pH as low as 7.8 [13]:'Currently, there are no known natural explanations for the observed decline in GLOBAL AVERAGE ocean pH, and, there is one, clear human-caused explanation (note the global bit is important - there is natural local variation in pH but we are concerned with global shifts).' - Switchboard [13]Since the ocean is acidifying, the organisms in the ocean will slowly die out, for anaerobic organisms to replace them and emit gases such as methane, as shown in the last round.==Conclusion==I have effectively refuted all my opponent's claims and have shown how my opponent has essentially conceded. Thus the resolution is affirmed.</t>

    <t>Okay thanks, it works now. That's okay, but scientifically the O has to be capitalized, because if you don't it's Cobalt2. Hence Cobalt is Co and Carbon Dioxide is CO2, so please remember to wirte it correct, thanks!Contention 1: CO2 and its effects. I deeply appologize for mistaking for what my opponent had stated as it came from my opponent's 7th source in his second round, but let's move on.The fact is that the Warming from it's effects are so microscopic that it does not cause the effects that my opponent has brought up and to mention that he has DROPPED this portion stating how much Warming Gasses come from humans and it's very microscopic.  I'll be posting that graph bellow.  Now once again if we look at this chart we can see that the gasses that are these Warming gasses and compare it to how much mankind has contributed to the Warming equation we can see that it is very microscopic at best and has no impact upon the globe as it is just so small and microscopic. This is an important point that my opponent dropped as it shows that humans are not contributing to Global Warming, but rather something else is. Prehaps is the cows who's manuer produces more methane now for some strange reason? Just in case the graph doesn't post I'll post it's information bellow. GAS -- GREENHOUSE EFFECT -- HUMAN EFFECTWater Vapor ------ 95.000% -- 0.001%Carbon Dioxide -- 3.618% ---- 0.117%Methane ----------- 0.360 ------ 0.066%Nitrous oxide ------ 0.950% ---- 0.047% Misc 0.072% ---- 0.047%Total 100% ------- 0.278%  [1]Remeber the Warming numbers that I have posted last round that CO2 is the equilivence to 1 GWP. We can also see that my Numbers that I've allowed for my calculations were more moddested as it showed more of an increase than my opponent is showing and that was from one of his earlier graphs. Once again it's a 0.15 F increase of temperature and that's assuming there's a 105 ppm increase compared to the mere 40 ppm increase that my opponent has shown which means that the temperature under these numbers would drop to around 0.06 F. Again there isn't a large enough amount of emmitions produced from humans to cause a great difference in a global meltdown that my opponent is predictings. If we observe the above Greenland Ice Core we can see that though it's been heating up we can swee that on average it's a whole lot colder than what it is on a normal basis. This is also acknowledging that humans have only been around in the past 10,000 years or so we can see that this Ice Core is still colder than normal even with the emmission that are produced today. Now if we observe the above graph of the past 400,000 yeasrs we can see that the CO2 rates in our atmosphere has flutated the exact same way in this cycle both before and during the existance of human beings. We can see that the temperatures and CO2 levels have been going up and down randomly for the past 100 thousands years and it is observed that this occured before the industrial revolution. We can also see that right now we are in a warming period so that arguing that humans are because of this is post hoc. Not to mention that we are in the coldest of the warming periods in Earth's history! We can see that once again despite contrary to belief we can see that though there may be warming the fact is simply that there is no human warming.What I'm showing on my logerithum is that there is no corrilation to what my opponent is stating and this shows that more CO2 doesn't harm the atmosphere and destroy it like that of what my opponent is stating. Contention 2: Earth is cooling.My opponent drops the hot spot argument so we'll move on to the next argument. Once again we can see that the IPCC and Al Gore are inccorect as the hocky stick graph is a bust. As I've shown in earlier rounds and they have been dropped in showing that the Earth's temperature has indeed been way hotter then current and on an average basis at that. My opponent has also dropped my opening graph in C1 r2 That also showed that CO2 levels are at an all time low! Thus once again disproving my opponent's theory.Here we can see that even though CO2 levels are increaseing that the temperature in recent years has actually decreased on the linear scale. Also the US Senate Committe on Envirnment and public works also took a stab at this issue. They found that the Hocky Stick graph was also bogus in 2006. “Today’s NAS report reaffirms what I have been saying all along, that Mann's ‘hockey stick’ is broken,”Senator Inhofe said. “Today’s report refutes Mann's prior assertions that there was no Medieval Warm Period or Little Ice Age.” “This report shows that the planet warmed for about 200 years prior to the industrial age, when we were coming out of the depths of the Little Ice Age where harsh winters froze the Thames and caused untold deaths. “Trying to prove man-made global warming by comparing the well-known fact that today's temperatures are warmer than during the Little Ice Age is akin to comparing summer to winter to show a catastrophic temperature trend.” [2]Here we can see that they've found that this warming of the similiar to what my opponent is trying to prove is indeed bogus. Paleoclimate scientist Bob Carter had shown through his research at University of East Angila in the United Kingdom that the Climate Change increase had actually froze from 1998-2006 showing that this so called Global Warming had actually stopped. [3]  Contention 3: Artic Ice and Sea Levels.I do not concede the arugment as it shows that there is a plus or minus .3 mm increase or decrease each year which as I've shown in previous graphs in previous rounds that it's a cycle. The graph bellow is proof of the cycle of what I'm talking about. Plus even if it was caused by Global Warming my opponent still has to prove that it was caused by HUMANS in order to take the win here not to show that it exists.According studies done by Ola Johannessen we can see that the Greenland Ice Sheet is growing! Also we can see from the same study is that the Artic was actually warmer in the 1930's than today! [4]s://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com...; alt='' /gt;Here we can see that the Antartic Ice has been increasing recently, but you may ask what about the Artic Lannan? Well let's look.s://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com...; alt='' /gt;Well I'll be, not only is the artic ice growing, but it's getting thicker and thicker. According to studies we can see that if we tack on one more year to my opponent's graph we can see that he fails to tell you that from August 2012 to August 2013 that the Artic Ice grew 533,000 square miles and this is according to NASA charts.Contention 4: Hurricane and TornadosIf we observe the above graph we can see that there is no net increase in violent Hurricanes nor their wind speed. We can see that my includes more years and hence more data which disproves my opponents. Plus when you add in my R2 graph, which was unrefuted, you can see that there is zero if not a decreasing trend when it comes to hurricanes.Contention 5: Ocean AcidificationClimatoligist Rodger Pielke sr. has found that in the past when the Ocean has gained heat the Ocean has lost that heat within 2 years of which it was gained. Who has been quoted saying, 'certainly indicates that the multi-decadal global climate models have serious issues with their ability to accurately simulate the response of the climate system to human- and natural-climate forcings.' [5] This shows that the Ocean cannot be gaining this gaining an over exaggerated amount of CO2 causing the acidification that my opponent has been claiming. We can actually see that my opponent's graph actually fits within the amount of pH varriation that I have stated last round which further prooves my point. </t>

    <t>Contention 1: No Major/any CO2 Increase.      Many Global Warming advocates state that CO2 levels are skyrocketing, but that is incorrect. I give you the above graph measuring the past 600 million years of CO2 levels are we are actually at an all time low. Now the website I got this from no longer has this page up so I appologize. We can see from observance of this graph that we being at all time CO2 low levles that we are nowhere close to meeting the impact that my opponent brings up. We have been over 5,000 ppm of CO2 in our atmosphere and are now currently around apprx. 350 ppm CO2 levels.  The above graph shows that comparisions of C13 (Carbon isotope) and this shows that there is little to no trend pertrade in many of these as the average is zero while the trend for all of these are zero. (1) This is important as the Carbon isotope is important in measuring this so called 'Global Warming.'  This chart above shows the CO2 and Earth's temperatures for the past 600 million years. My opponent's claims are incorect as we have had aburd levels of CO2 and temperature on Earth and may I ask how did we survive that? (2) Now I will move on to how Earth is actually cooling and how it's temperature is cooler than it has been. Contention 2: Earth is cooling.  If we observe the above graph we can see that Earth has been a whole lot hotter than where we currently are to the point where the Earth's average temperature has been 7.5 degrees Celcuis hotter than it currently it is. You can also see that in the span of the past 10,000 years the temperature has leveld off, but you may ask yourself where does that place us in the lights of modern day?  I am going to site Dr. Done Easterbrook, who is a climate scientist. Back in 2000 he predicted that Earth was entering a cooling phase. He predicts that for the next 20 years Earth will cool by 3/10 degree each year and that we are going to enter another little Ice Age like we did from 1650 and 1790. (3) The funny thing is that many of my opponent's charts are actually from the incorrect IPPC. How about the 'Hockey Stick' graph that many Global Warming supporters , including my opponent, argue about? Well if we observe the fallowing chart taken from Northern Scandenavia we can see that the Global trend over the past 1,000 years that the Global Cooling trend slope is that of -0.31 Degrees Celcuis, give or take 0.03 degrees (for the error room). Professor Dr. Jan Esper has found that the Earth's temperature of Earth actually decreases 0.3 per millenia due to the Earth moving away from the sun. (4)   Here is another graph from 1920 to 2005 and we can see that the graph has a negative temperature slope, thus meaning that the Earth is under a period of cooling. (5)  You can see in terms of more Warming in the evidence in which Scientists use Ice Cores Earth has actually been Cooling the past Mellenium. You can see that in terms of Gasses contribution to the Green House Effect the major contributer is Water Vapor and it's at 95% to CO2's 3.6% and this is the overall contribution including man made and natural. When we look to the chart on the left we can see that Man-Made CO2 does have a higher contribution to the atmosphere than Water Vapor, but that's because we do not create much water vapor as humans. Even with this evidence we can see that CO2 does not have any effect what-so-ever compared to Water Vapor. (6) Where might those CFCs be on this graph you may ask. Why it's under the Misc. gases section. Contention 3: Artic Ice. First, I would like to state that Pro's claim about the North Pole completely melting is bogus. Al Gore stated that the Artic Ice would be completely melted by 2014, but he is incorrect then and now.  Jan. 6, 2012: The Coast Guard Cutter Healy breaks ice around the Russian-flagged tanker Renda 250 miles south of Nome. The Healy is the Coast Guard’s only currently operating polar icebreaker. The vessels are transiting through ice up to five-feet thick in this area. The 370-foot tanker Renda will have to go through more than 300 miles of sea ice to get to Nome, a city of about 3,500 people on the western Alaska coastline that did not get its last pre-winter fuel delivery because of a massive storm. (7) Let's go back to 2007-2008 and see if his claim was justified in the Artic Ice activity.  Hmmm... It seems that he is incorrect, but let's look further into the near past. How about 2012-2013? (8) We all remember the Climate Scientists that got stuck in Arctic Ice Earlier last year correct? Then a Russian Ice Breaker tried to free them, but got stuck. Can you guess what they were studying? They had predicted that all the Arctic Ice had melted due to Global Warming and that Earth would get flooded massively. Boy were they wrong. (9)  (10)  Dr. Koonin, former head of the Department of Energy under President Obama, has stated that the Global Warming scare is not suttle. This is because that he has found 3 things wrong and highly incorrect about the scare. 1. Shrinking of Artic Sea ice doesn't acount for the gaining of the Antartic ice. 2. The warming of Earth's temps today is the same as it was 30 years ago. 3. The sea levels rose at the same height and rate in the 20th cenury. (11)  Contention 4: Sea Levels  Here is another corralation that must happen. If the Ice Caps are completely melted as Pro claims then the sea level would have risen completely drowning tons of land.  The graph above is raw satellite image data of the sea level rise over an 8 year period showing that there is little to no change in the Sea Levels rising. (12) The sea level rises, on average, about 3 inches per century and it has been found to not even been rising at all.  This graph is the sea levels off the cost of French Guyana which is one of the areas which is predicted to be flooded due to Global Warming, but as you can see by the graph (which goes to 2008) the sea level is currently on a downward trend. (13) The source is the PDF within the link.Contention 5: The Weather My opponent is claiming that Hurricanes are increasing due to Global Warming, but this claim is indeed false! The hurricanes since the year 1900 to 2008 have actually been decreasing. The slope of this downward slope is .0016. Though it is small the hurricanes are still in a downward trend.As a matter of fact not only are Hurricanes on a downward trend, but they are at an all time low as in the year 2010, there was only 68 Hurricanes Globally, which is an all time low in the past 40 years. How about Tornados you may ask?In the graph above you can see that tornados are at an all time low in the past 60 years! (14) But what about Hurricanes?Here is a graph showing the number of days between hurricanes and this shows that the number of days between hurricanes is greatest at 76 days between hurricanes.The slope of this line is zero showing no trend of a massive storm increase.</t>

    <t>My opponent agreed that the rule violation is a misunderstanding (see comments section). Whether you want to leave it alone or make it a conduct loss is up to the voters.  Now let's get to the debate. I also appologize if I do not get to everything ahead of time as I will likely run out of characters. Contention 1: CO2 and Temperatures. Firstly let bring up just how much these accused compounds exactly warm the Earth's atmosphere. CO2 for example has the global warming potential of 1. Here are the other numbers. Carbon Dioxide -- 1Methane -- 21Nitrous Oxide -- 298-310CFC's -- VariousWater Vapor -- 0.25 [1] Now I just want you to keep this in mind for this next part here. We may observe that humans release approximately 35 gigatons of CO2 a year. [2] This is only 4.3% of the total amount of all Global Warming Gasses, however it is incrediably small when it comes to comparing the rest of the Global Warming gasses. If we observe the chart bellow we can see that Water Vapor is a large Contributor to Global Warming at 95% and CO2 comes in second. But here's the kicker. If we look at the Human contributed part that I'm about to post in the graph bellow we can see that it's very miniscule of 0.117% of all total Warming gasses. Now let's do some quick math here. CO2's increase was from what my opponent is claiming is from 295 ppm to 400ppm, a total of only 105 ppm. 1 Gigaton of CO2 is the equilivent of 2.13 ppm. [3] This means that increase of 105 ppm means a total of 49.29 gigatons. Since 1 gigaton of CO2 is the equivilance of .004% of the Greenhouse effect that means that 49.29 gigatons means an aditional .21% increase to Global Warming. This would account for a grand total of a 0.15 F increase in global temperature. This is a very measly amount and we can see that with my opponent's claims a simple 0.15 F increase isn't enough to melt glacers and have the effeccts that he is speaking of and it proves that this is NAUTRAL not man-made to fulfil his effects if they were real. Now remind yourself that Pro said in Round 2 that CO2 is responsable for LARGE amount of Global Warming. As we can plainly see here that this is incorrect.  My opponent goes and attempts to manipulate data by showing back as far as 1955, but when we push things back to the year 1900 we can see that temperature levels are actually decreasing on a linear slope.    Let us observe the above graph. Here I would like to point out the that the increase from Pre-Inustrial to Industrial era and the doubling of the CO2 leveling lead to a decrease in it's temperature.  Also we can see that the 10 mile 'hot-spot' above the tropics is actually absent. 'The computer models show that greenhouse warming will cause a hot-spot at an altitude between 8 and 12 km over the tropics between 30 N and 30 S. The temperature at this hot-spot is projected to increase at a rate of two to three times faster than at the surface. However, the Hadley Centre's real-world plot of radiosonde temperature observations shown below does not show the projected CO2 induced global warming hot-spot at all. The predicted hot-spot is entirely absent from the observational record. This shows that atmosphere warming theory programmed into climate models are wrong.' [4] Contention 2: Earth is cooling  Here we can see the plotted Global Warming Hot Spot that was suppose to be there according to the IPPC, however we'll see that they're wrong.   Why, it appears that this hotspot doesn't even exist! [7]  You're probably asking yourself, why am I seeing this graph again? This is because the more CO2 we get the less warming there is. If we observe this graph we can see that the Warming has decreased with more CO2 that we've recieved. This shows that CO2 doesn't have that much of an impact on the tempterature like the math that I've proved it in my last contention. [5]   Now I will agree that Eastbrook isn't good with predicting temperature change, but the IPCC is even worse, but whatever is causing the change it is highly unlikely that it's man made. Contention 3: Artic and Sea Levels  THough my opponent likes to blow things out of perportion we can see that these sea levels rise and fall on their own. It's a natural cycle as I showed last round. The trend shows only a mere +/- 0.30 mm per year. 'The Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory estimates the rate of sea level rise at 1.42 plus or minus 0.14 mm/year for the period 1954 to 2003. This is less than the estimate of 1.91 plus or minus 0.14 mm/year for the period 1902 to 1953, indicating a slowing of the rate.' [6] We can see that 2.8 inches per 50 years isn't that much of an appocolyptic threat.  Here is a graph from NOAA which shows that the sea level rise is very small and that the IPCC is way off as well as many other Warming 'experts'. [8]  In the above graph we can see that despit Artic Ice slightly decreasing we can see that it follows the same patern throughout the year as the Ice melts in the summer and freezes in the winter. We can see that my opponents' sea ice level predictions are incorrect. [9] Which if sea ice is decreasing then explain the great sea ice exspansion of Antartica in 2012 shown bellow. It had a total of 20,000 miles more ice than average.  Contention 4: Weather  The NOAA has shown that Tornados are less frequent and occur less and less. Now the irony behind this is that it comes out at the same time as my opponent's sources which claims the exact opposite. [10] Also I do wish that my opponet reposts link number 7 as it is broken and I cannot access it, so for now I continue to extend across my NOAA Hurricane graphs from last round. Contention 5: Ocean Acidfication Here I Would like to report that we do not emmitt Cobalt2. (I know you meant CO2) If we do some basic Chemistry we can see that 1-6 on the pH scale is acid 7 is neutral and 8-14 is base. The Ocean on average is 8.2 which is a base. Now let's add in the factor of the average coral reef needs CO2 and the average reef can varry from 9.2 to 7.6 throughout the day and night showing that there is no accidfication. This CO2 added envirnment has been seen to increase coral growth by 2 cm per year. We can also see that these areas very by 0.3 pH pending on the area.</t>
<h>    We may observe that humans release approximately 35 gigatons of CO2 a year. This is only 4.3% of the total amount of all Global Warming Gasses, however it is incrediably small when it comes to comparing the rest of the Global Warming gasses.</h>

    <t>;Thank you, lannan13. Please note that the first few arguments are identical to that of my last global warming debate as my opponent could not finish the last one and has decided to redo this.==Contention 1: The correlation between increase in Carbon Dioxide and global temperature==Throughout the last 650,000 years, there have been seven cycles of glacial advances and retreats, where the carbon dioxide levels abruptly increased, then gradually decreased afterward. However, in 1950, Co2 levels were at a critical level and kept on rising. As of 2014, the global Co2 levels were at an all time high of nearly 400 parts per million [1]:2 has increased since the Industrial Revolution. (Source: [[LINKAs we can see above, in the last 650,000 years, the Co2 levels have never grown above 300 ppm, as opposed to now, where the Co2 levels are at 400 ppm. Obviously, this abrupt growth in Co2 levels are caused by human activity, such as mass production, the use of electricity, polluting, etc.I have provide a youtube video above to show the correlation between the high Co2 levels and global temperature [2]. When both are compared, this becomes irrefutable evidence that man-made global warming exists.In fact, as of 2013, the average global temperature was 14.6 degrees Celsius (58.3 degrees Fahrenheit), which is 0.8 degrees Celsius (1.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than when the year was 1880, and 0.6 degrees Celsius (1.1 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the mid-20th century baseline [3][4][5]: Already, on the first contention, we have seen major evidence affirming the resolution.==Contention 2: The cause and effect of the Greenhouse Effect and what makes it more powerful==The greenhouse effect on Planet Earth has been occurring for almost its whole life and is a natural phenomenon, since greenhouse gases such as Co2 have existed on Earth from its birth, thus heating the Earth to help sustain forms of life [6]:'To its credit, the greenhouse effect has been around long before humans began to burn fossil fuels, and it is a natural phenomenon in that makes life habitable for all living things.' [6]The greenhouse effect operates when the sun's heat passes through Earth's atmosphere, heats the Earth's surface and is reflected back upward. Most of this heat is absorbed by the greenhouse gases like water vapor, Co2 and methane. Afterward, the heat is re-emited in all directions, thus starting the cycle again, continuously heating the Earth. Greenhouse gases literally act like a thermal blanket for Earth [7]:of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide – act as a thermal blanket for the Earth, absorbing heat and warming the surface to a life-supporting average of 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius).' /gt; 'A layer of greenhouse gases – primarily water vapor, and including much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide – act as a thermal blanket for the Earth, absorbing heat and warming the surface to a life-supporting average of 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius).' [7]From this information, we can conclude that the more greenhouse gases are put into the atmosphere, the more heat from the sun is absorbed, thus creating a powerful greenhouse effect. Human actvity is causing this to happen.P1) The more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the more powerful the greenhouse effectP2) Human activity is emitting more greenhouse gases into the atmosphereC) Human activity is the cause of a more powerful greenhouse effect, and thus man-made global warming exists.To further prove this point, let us inspect Earth's neighboring planets, Mars and Venus.Mars' atmosphere is quite thin, and it's nearly completely made up of Co2. However, it is because of the low atmospheric pressure and lack of other greenhouse gases that the greenhouse effect is not at all strong and thus Mars has a frozen surface without any signs of organisms [7].'Not enough greenhouse effect: The planet Mars has a very thin atmosphere, nearly all carbon dioxide. Because of the low atmospheric pressure, and with little to no methane or water vapor to reinforce the weak greenhouse effect, Mars has a largely frozen surface that shows no evidence of life.' [7]Now, let us inspect Venus.Despite Venus' atmosphere also being almost entirely carbon dioxide, the amount of Co2 Venus contains is about 300 times as much as Mars' or Earth's. This creates a HUGELY powerful greenhouse effect, causing a temperature so high that lead could not stay solid. [7]'Too much greenhouse effect: The atmosphere of Venus, like Mars, is nearly all carbon dioxide. But Venus has about 300 times as much carbon dioxide in its atmosphere as Earth and Mars do, producing a runaway greenhouse effect and a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead.' [7]Again this information is major evidence of the existence of man-made global warming.==Conclusion==I have put forward major evidence and arguments proving the existence of man-made global warming. I have also put out evidence that the greenhouse effect does indeed exist.Thus, the resolution is affirmed.</t>
<h>    When both are compared, this becomes irrefutable evidence that man-made global warming exists. In fact, as of 2013, the average global temperature was 14.6 degrees Celsius, which is 0.6 degrees Celsius warmer than the mid-20th century baseline.</h>

    <t>Got it. From this round I will refer to Carbon Dioxide as CO2.Also, my round 2 sites are incorrectly entered. Here they are in respective order. ==Rebuttal 1:  CO2 and its effects==The statement that humans are not contributing to the emission of greenhouse gases is completely false. Many sites [1-3] point out that humans are, in fact, the most major cause of warming in modern days.'Natural changes alone can’t explain the temperature changes we’ve seen.' - Union of Concerned Scientists [2]'Scientists have closed the case: Human activity is causing the Earth to get hotter.' - Environmental Defense Fund [3]And, if we were to agree with my opponent's logic, then his arguments are contradictory to his third graph - where he states that Carbon Dioxide is correlating with temperatures perfectly, which is true [4][5]: Keep in mind that both charts show increasing temperature and temperature increase rates, but short after the Industrial Revolution began, contrary to my opponent's selective graphs where he tries to disprove warming by selecting a range of 10,000 years, when really the Industrial Revolution only started in the 18th century [6]. My opponent's third graph, as proven, is contradicted by my opponent's statements above. Let us look at his two halves of his chart combined [7]: If the warming effect of CO2 is minimal, then how would the temperature correlate with it so perfectly? And even then, in the years before, the temperature would drop almost instantly after it reached its peak, but the warming period we are in is actually holding itself up there, rather than just being pulled down. Also, we cannot use this graph anyway as the time scale is way too large to see our effects in recent years. Moreover, his charts could be misleading as he has not cited any links to substantiate his second, third and fourth charts. Let us look at his fourth chart.His fourth chart tells us that water vapor and other natural causes cover the vast majority of contributions to the greenhouse effect, whilst human emissions only cover about 0.28% of contributions. However, this is very misleading, because it does not count in ANY OTHER FACTORS. For example, we already know that humans have deforestated the vast majority of forests on Earth [8]:Wildfires, which already contribute to the greenhouse effect [9], are affecting the area of forests worldwide [8]:           Trends in wildlife area burned in wildfire in U.S.    '“Wildfire emissions can have remarkable impacts on radiative forcing,” says Liu.' - USDA [9] 'Tropical deforestation contributes as much as 90% of the current net release of biotic carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This change may represent as much as 20% - 30% of the total carbon flux due to humans - i.e., rivaling the carbon release due to fossil fuel burning.' - Global Change [9]Humans, as shown bove, are acidifying the ocean and deforestating (cutting down trees from forests), which is labeled as one of the more major causes of the greenhouse effect on my opponent's chart. As for my opponent's logarithm argument, this is also contradicting the correlation of CO2 and temperatures because the logarithm would not be able to cause a perfect correlation. Thus this argument is null.==Rebuttal 2: The Earth is cooling==My opponent states that his hot spot argument was dropped, when in reality I had responded to this with two paragraphs of evidence. My opponent is straw-manning here. My opponent even goes on to state that I dropped his CO2 argument, to which I responded with even more text. That went unrefuted by my opponent.Also, the 'Hockey Stick' graph is actually proven many times to be quite accurate (at least in the warming period) by studies of different sources, like corals, stalagmites, tree rings, boreholes and ice cores. All confirm that the 20th century saw the most dramatic increase in global temperatue in recent history.'Since the hockey stick paper in 1998, there have been a number of proxy studies analysing a variety of different sources including corals, stalagmites, tree rings, boreholes and ice cores. They all confirm the original hockey stick conclusion: the 20th century is the warmest in the last 1000 years and that warming was most dramatic after 1920.' - Skeptical Science [10]Note that my opponent's next graph is a very selective one and that its time scale is literally over a ten-year period. Plus, the grap shows the temperature variations, which ends up being above zero. This graph is contradictory to my opponent's arguments.Also, my opponent's quote and evidence that global warming as stopped is also quite selective as it is over a period of 8 years. My opponent is blatantly biased as he only used selective time periods instead of an actually unbiased time period, where it focuses on where humans have been speculated to have started to contribute to global warming.==Rebuttal 3: Arctic Ice and Sea Levels==Again, my opponent's graph here only shows a time period of 45 years. Let us look at a graph starting from 0 CE, and as we can see towards the end the sea level rises dramatically [11]:s://motherjones.com...; alt='Different ways to measure sea level over time' /gt; As you can see the sea level has risen over 20 cm since the start of the Industrial Revolution and has been very consistent throughout this period.My opponent then goes on to reinstate his argument that Arctic Ice is increasing, which I had already refuted with my NASA evidence, which was collected in late 2014, while my opponent uses data from 2006 and 2013. Even then, my opponent only uses two photographs of the Arctic Ice, each from two single, separate days, which again is subjective because it doesn't show anything over time, but rather it only shows separate days. Again disregard this piece of evidence. Also, even though I concede the Antarctic Ice expansion, I had proven Arctic Ice was losing ice more than twice as fast than the Antarctic Ice grew. Thus this point is null.==Rebuttal 4: Hurricanes and Tornadoes==My opponent drops my argument that tornadoes do not link to global warming.My opponent is misunderstanding my hurricane intensity argument. It has been shown that when sea levels rise (which I proved true) stronger hurricanes get stronger, but weaker hurricanes show little to no trend. [12]'But more significantly, Elsner found weaker hurricanes showed little to no trend while stronger hurricanes showed a greater upward trend. In other words, stronger hurricanes are getting stronger. This means that as sea temperatures continue to rise, the number of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes hitting land will inevitably increase.' - Skeptical Science [12]My opponent even states that I dropped his R2 graph, which I responded to throughout the debate. The link was only broken. My opponent keeps straw-manning that I drop his arguments when a lot of my arguments have been left unrefuted. I ask my opponent to stop.==Rebuttal 5: Ocean Acidification==My opponent is saying that since the ocean has not acidified to a certain point that can be deemed critical. However my opponent must notice that small parts of the ocean are acidifying to the point that organisms are dying and being replaced with anaerobic organisms, which produce methane, which further contributes to global warming. Parts of this are directly caused by normal everyday pollution, which an kill animals and bleach corals, which has been proven above to have alreday happened.==Dropped arguments== My opponent drops the following arguments/rebuttals:- That CO2 levels have been ising exponentially over the last few centuries- That CO2 levels 600,000,000 years ago are irrelevant since not even the dinosaurs had existed then- That my opponents graphs are very selective and biased- That the Arctic is losing ice more than twice as fast than the Antarctic is gaining ice- That tornadoes do not have a link to global warming- That ocean acidification, even if not at a critical level, is affecting the temperature of the surroundings.I would like to remind my opponent that he must not respond to these dropped arguments in the last round as I cannot respond to them. Any new rebuttals to these dropped arguments should be disregarded.==Conclusion==I have effectively refuted all my opponent's arguments, countered my own, and also proven that my opponent has dropped some of my arguments.The resolution is affirmed.</t>

    <t>Let's begin..   Case Defense   I-Cost   I would like to say that I am truly apologetic for the misunderstanding concerning cost however the con’s demands are very unfair and limiting. I will agree that it is abusive for me to change the cost and the distance in the plan during the second round but the change comes far from the middle of the debate; so what is the impact of my abuse on the round itself? Whatever it may be I would like to point out that it should not be that the con team gets to fabricate their own price, that is unfair and that is abusive. If the con should get to decide his own price then the debate is literally already over because he can fabricate a price as high as he wants, is that fair…remember that I Never said that the price listed was wrong, I simply showed that I couldn’t support the price because I don’t have the proper evidence I Do have evidence which supports a cost though, and I have presented that evidence. The con team cannot deny this. Con wants to label me a cheater and an abuser because I have been forced to alter the plan, yet he wishes to create a falsified price in order to make it impossible for me to win thus ironically being the abuser himself. This is the resolution to the problem which I will propose and like it or not this is simply the only reasonable option remaining in the round. I see that it is abusive to change things in the round. I have changed 2 things, the distance and showed proof for a different cost. Thus I will keep the distance at 49,515 miles of construction for a cost of 8.1 billion dollars. This does nothing but help con, it may not help him as much as letting him fabricate a price but it still definitely helps his case while hurting mine. To be honest I have no qualms about this price because it can still get paid off if 1 hurricane with the median cost strikes the US. This really only extends the payoff time to 4.5 years as well which is really not bad. Take it as my word, the plan will not be changed any longer. I would also specify that the plan will be paid for through normal means.    II-Cost II Here is exactly why your price is invalid, again I will reiterate. Con is literally claiming that because artificial reefs have the qualities of an artificial breakwater that they actually are artificial breakwaters. This is simply illogical and is analogous to claiming that a sponge, for instance, is the same as a straw because they both suck things up. It is completely irrational and should be invalidated as any sort of point.    III-States I dislike that con and pro are playing some sort of sematics/interpretation game but here is the fact on this. I clearly stated that the plan will take place on All Feasable Costal States, I then gave some Examples of a few costal states, If con misinterpreted the plan text then that is unfortunate but the way any rational person would understand it, is as I would in my opinion and thus I wont go into this very much.    IV-Trade Con has ignored my evidence. It is impossible to for a ship to get caught on any reefs I will build as they will be from 12-30 miles off of the coast line which is as deep as 400 meters deep. It would literally be impossible for any ship to get caught on our artificial reefs at this distance as I have proven. If con disagrees he cannot prove the contrary by citing cases where a ship has gotten caught on a Regular Reef that is not even between 12-30 miles off of the coast. Really con needs to find quoted evidence proving that artificial reefs which are never more than 10 feet tall would somehow block all trade in the US while in water that is at least 300 meters deep.         Case Offense   Aids/HIV   A.)  Staggering numbers of people have HIV and are dying from the epidemic World Health Organization [Since the beginning of the epidemic, almost 78 million people have been infected with the HIV virus and about 39 million people have died of HIV. Globally, 35.0 million [33.2–37.2 million] people were living with HIV at the end of 2013.]    B.)  As stated in first round, Coral reefs provide a plethora of cures to diseases. The government has literally found a protein derived from coral reefs that prevents the spread of HIV National, April 29, 2014, 'Coral reefs provide potent new anti-HIV proteins,' EurekAlert!. [Testing the proteins against laboratory strains of HIV, the researchers found that cnidarians were highly potent, blocking HIV at miniscule concentrations—one billionth of a gram. They worked by binding to the virus and preventing it from fusing with the CD4 membrane. “It’s always thrilling when you find a brand-new protein that nobody else has ever seen before,” senior investigator Barry O’Keefe, PhD, deputy chief of the Molecular Targets Laboratory at the National Cancer Institute’s Center for Cancer Research, said in a release. “And the fact that this protein appears to block HIV infection—and to do it in a completely new way—makes this truly exciting.”] Furthermore [Researchers will now look to produce larger amounts of the proteins for further testing. “Making more of it is a big key,” O’Keefe said. “You can’t strip the Earth of this coral trying to harvest this protein, so our focus now is on finding ways to produce more of it so we can proceed with preclinical testing.”] Now folks, logically, what might be the result of creating a utopia of coral reefs in the U.S.? Simply put, the preventative cure for HIV. The evidence above states that the only thing needed is More Coral Reefs, the plan provides and thus will significantly reduce the amount of HIV/AIDs in the world and US given more time to do research.      Fisheries I-Status quo of the fishing industry and environment A.)  Fisheries Doomed If every coral reef in the world was a strictly protected area, and if every fisherman was prevented from fishing, unlikely as these options are, coral reef fisheries could still not recover. Many or most reef habitats are already so badly degraded that they cannot regain the carrying capacity for economically valued species that they formerly had.    B.)  Fishing methods are unsustainable, industry wont change The richest countries like the European Union, the United States, Japan are the most damaging, and 90% of the top predatory fish are now gone (Myers and Worm, 2003)...the coral reef habitat and thereby the future fisheries are permanently destroyed    C.)   Situation is getting worse the degradation of marine ecosystems and fisheries can only be expected to worsen    D.)  The situation is getting worse II areas are too severely degraded to allow recovery of corals, fish, and invertebrates to former levels because the habitat quality is so badly degraded that reefs have lost most of their carrying capacity for these species. Even if every reef was strictly protected and all fishermen were eliminated today, the fisheries would still not be able to recover to former levels. There is no doubt that over-fishing has been disastrous almost everywhere (Pauly et al.,1998; 2000)    II-Significance/Harm of Reef Degradation A.)  impact on countries Over 100 countries could lose their major source of marine biodiversity, beach sand supplies, tourism, fisheries, and coastal protection in the next few years if current trends continue, with severe but incalculably high economic losses (Goreau and Hayes, this volume).      III-Solvency: what do we do now and what are the benefits?   A.)  Now is The Time to Start Saving Reefs The tools are now in our hands for saving coral reef and oyster reef ecosystems from extinction from over-harvesting, global warming, and pollution, protecting coastlines from global sea level rise, increasing fisheries, and saving beaches and tourism economies. There is of course a real cost, but the sooner large scale investments are made in marine ecosystem restoration the greater the benefits will be and the lower the expenditures needed. There is now no other alternative to effectively reverse global marine degradation that is accelerating out of control except to do nothing.    B.)  Mineral Accretion is now the only effective way to revive our reefs and fishing industry Large-scale habitat restoration of degraded areas is now the only hope for recovery of the coastal fisheries, biodiversity, sand supplies, and shore protection that only large healthy reefs can provide. Unless the vast wastelands of degraded reefs are restored, all tropical coastal countries will soon face crippling economic losses. Unfortunately, at this time there is no serious funding for large-scale coral reef restoration.    C.)   Healing Powers of Mineral Accretion In the Maldives Biorock [Mineral accretion] reefs have effectively absorbed wave energy that they have turned an eroding beach into a growing one (Goreau, Hilbertz, Hakeem and Hameed, 2000). In Indonesia dense schools of fish in Biorock [Mineral accretion] structures have caused fishermen to start building similar structures to increase catches (Goreau and Hilbertz, 2001). Settlement of larval corals can take place at exceptionally high densities, hundreds per square meter, under conditions where poor water quality has prevented all settlement on natural substrates (Goreau and Hilbertz, 1996). Larval and adult fishes are attracted to these structures at exceptional densities, quickly forming schools so dense that one cannot see across the structures.   D.)  The Value of Reefs While most benefits of coral reefs can not possibly be quantified in monetary terms, such as the value of biodiversity, biogeochemical cycling services, and esthetic beauty, three of them are amenable to direct economic valuation: fisheries, tourism, and shore protection   E.)   Monetary Estimate of the value of reefs When considered as earnings per kilometer of reefs, the values for fisheries and for tourism typically ranged from several thousand dollars to several million dollars per kilometer of reef per year   no space for a summary, but citations in comments section.

    <t>1. Pro has never claimed that this is policy debate   (From the Government agency rebuttal) 1.) The plan will be carried out through Normal Means, Just as Every Single Policy Debate Plan Is.   Policy: a high-level overall plan embracing the general goals and acceptable procedures especially of a governmental body. Plan text: The USFG should increase construction of mineral accretion coral reefs in the US   Therefore, as the United States Federal Government is accomplishing this and it is a high level plan, this is a debate on policy making it policy debate. The pro stating that they never claimed to be doing a policy debate does not excuse the fact that the resolution implies it.   2. The ‘entire point’ of policy debate is NOT to evaluate a plan, but is to promote education and learning.   Policy debate is a form of debate competition in which teams of two advocate for and against a resolution that typically calls for policy change by the United States federal government. While the con generally frowns on the use of Wikipedia as a main source, the description is accurate and relies on multiple debate organizations for their definition. More importantly, it’s more evidence than the pro, who holds the burden of proof, has provided.     3.Con wishes to implement his own price, which I will later explain doesn’t make sense anyways, thus making the round literally impossible to win   The pro has not explicitly stated in any round how the con is fabricating prices. As the con made sure to use the evidence provided by the pro, in addition to simple mathematics, it’s impossible for the con to have fabricated a price that was not equal to the actual cost of the plan.   This destroys the educational value of the debate because there can be no education if there is no round in the first place. Not only this, but it wastes space in the debate reducing the amount we can argue that actually has educational value. The educational value is elicited by those viewing this debate. It will teach them to not amend their plan or otherwise change rules without stating them in their 1AC, thereby destroying the structure of policy debate. In order to maintain the future of education, infractions must be addressed so as to keep them from becoming the norm.     This also hurts the sportsmanship of the game and promotes tension between the players. This clearly also hurts educational value.   This tension is irrelevant if any is felt. As the point of the debate is to evaluate the Affirmative teams plan, the con is not obliged to sidestep possibly sensitive subjects to the pro in order to keep their emotions manageable. However, the con recognizes that antagonizing the pro, or con for that matter, is not acceptable and apologizes if it appears that that was the goal.   Thus, Con’s propositions are abuses which far outweigh any abuses which I have committed and the second price should stand. Con has disproved abuse by the Negative team, therefore the issues that were stated previously still stand against them.     Price   1. Artificial reefs are NOT artificial breakwaters just because they have a similar sounding definition.   Actually, that’s exactly how something falls in to a category. The con has provided evidence of a category and used the pros own evidence to prescribe the actual cost resulting from this. The pro has failed to provide evidence that artificial reefs are not a type of artificial breakwater, thereby refusing to provide clash which is an integral part of education in a debate.   2. Thus the price of artificial breakwaters is NOT the same as the price of artificial reefs   See Price-1 for analytics that disprove this statement.   3.I also have provided quoted evidence from a massive study which declares artificial reefs of the mineral accretion assortment only cost 50,000-$100,000/ kilometer which equals about $75/meter, giving us a grand total of 8.1 billion dollars for the plan   The pro provided evidence on a possible cost of artificial reefs. However, as they never disproved that these man-made reefs were not a type of artificial breakwater, the con must assume the worst as the possibility of over 9 percent of the USFG budget being lost is still very real.   4.Thus because I have professional evidence and because Con is using completely flawed logic for his calculation, my answer is the one should remain in play   The con has used the pros own evidence and simple mathematics to determine the cost, unless the pro is claiming that their own evidence is actually flawed analytics. In that case, the pro argument is negated as they have then failed to provide any evidence of cost and con arguments still stand.     States 1. The plan literally states: “the plan will take place on all feasible coastal states” Again, the con reiterates that this is twisting the plan text by avoiding what is really said. The real plan text is as follows: The plan will take place on all feasible coastal states: (California, Louisiana, Texas, South Carolina, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, New Jersey, and Maine) are all up for consideration As the judges can see, the full sentence significantly changes the context. Instead of saying all feasible coastal states of the USA, it specifically defines the states up for consideration. This is an issue when there are specific states, defined earlier in the debate, that have been hit by hurricanes and are not protected. 2. The plan doesn’t Ever state: “only the listed states will be up for consideration” This is correct, the plan does not state this. However, the plan ends up doing what this sentence implies as proven in States-1.   3. This means that the con is using semantics and assumptions which aren’t based on what is literally in the plan text, while I am. The con disagrees that it is using semantics when the subject is whether or not the plan actually does what the pro claims it will do. Considering the plan is supposed to protect people endangered by hurricanes, the blatant dismissal of threatened states must be addressed.   4.Finally the plan also states that I affirm the right to clarify my case as necessary, meaning if there is a simply word confusion, like this, I can clarify what it really means.   Clarify: to make (something) easier to understand. The pro implies that this is difficult to understand, however the con is having no issue in reading the text. The dilemma is the fact that this plan is explicitly defining the states that can be evaluated. In fact, the line below it specifically excludes Alaska. 5.Thus my and the literally states interpretation must be the accepted version   The pro never provided a definition. Their interpretation is that the con is wrong which is not a counter definition nor a clarification.   6.Thus please strike out the states disadvantage   Using evidence from above, pro argument is effectively dropped, flow to con.   Government agency 1.The plan will be carried out through Normal Means, Just as Every Single Policy Debate Plan Is. The con recommends that the pro browse through the open evidence project. It has plenty of policy debates that have actual funding programs and agents of action. This means that the plan will be carried out in the normal way that congress would pass/fund/and operate any given plan. Congress funds and operates any given plan by finding a source for the money and an agent of action. As the Pro has never been able to define either, con argument stands.   2. Thus the agent of action and funding are all taken care of See Government agency-3   3. the agent of action is not critical to supporting the educational value of the debate   As pro never defines what is actually educational, the con will state that the agent of action is critical to supporting the educational value of this debate, thereby negating them as they are using analytics as well. 4. Thus it doesn’t matter in any case   This is an unreasonable jump in logic, suggesting that no entity in the USFG acting as an agent of action matters. The con will call this untopical and leave it at that as it provides no worth to debate this under the resolution.   5. There is no rule which mandates that an agent me named   The con will assume that the pro meant ‘an agent be named’. And this is true, no one has to execute the plan by your text, therefore no one will, therefore billions will be wasted on a plan that no one is executing.   6. Thus I have not broken any rules and no abuse has been done   The abuse lies in the claims that the con is fabricating claims in addition to complaints about the con not allowing amendments to the plan text at the whim of the pro. The con assumes that the pro is at least somewhat familiar with the basis of policy debate to respect the base structure of it and demands that it be given so as to allow for structured debate instead of letting emotional bias take effect.   Trade Pro failed to provide counter evidence. The plan also does not establish the distance that they claim the reefs will be at from shore.  Fisheries The fisheries evidence came from the pro, so the pro trying to discredit their own evidence is not showing a healthy and well made plan. The con has already provided the evidence and quotes needed to negate the pros arguments in the previous round, extend them and note that the first quote from con in the previous round still negates the pro arguments as they came from the pros own evidence. The shore protection, as stated in the previous round, is covered under the state protection disad.   Tourism Pro evidence claims that artificial coral reefs are made of the same material as a coral reef, calcium. Therefore the same dangers to biodiversity apply unless the pro had proven that these man-made reefs would be stronger.</t>

    <t>CASE DEFENSE  I. COST A.) Cost of the plan itselfCon has claimed the the price of the plan will be somewhere around 9% of the GDP using his personal calculations. Con has however pointed something of concern out. The plan I presented was premade by someone else and thus I have no idea how the calculations came about, this means I cannot support the plans stated cost however using evidence I found, which I know is correct, I came out with another answer. The number is much higher the one listed in the plan, yet Much Much smaller than the fabricated price that con created. My calculations resulted in a price of 7.2 billion dollars, I then cut the distance in the plan from 49,515 to just 30,000 miles leaving us with a price of 3.6 billion dollars, a price which I can still easily justify… But before I tell you how I got that answer let’s examine why con came out with the wrong answer. Christopher used his 2014 Department of Interior citation (I’ll refer to it as the DOI from now on) stating that the average cost of building an artificial breakwater is [$19, 791 per 1 meter] he then multiplied this DOI estimate times the number of meters constructed in the plan. This gave him the answer of 9% of the GDP. The real cost of construction per meter is not $19,791 because the plan does not call for the construction of Artificial Breakwaters, it calls for the construction of Mineral Acceretion Artificial Reefs, two different things. The real cost is found in my first citation which is a study by the coral reef alliance using the results of at least 12 other credited studies: “each kilometer of shoreline can be protected for about $50,000 to $100,000 [using mineral accretion]. This is only around 0.3 to 0.6% of the cost of a conventional sea wall, which provides no tourism or fisheries benefits.” Here is the exact method I used to get my answer of $3.6 b: $75,000/1kilometer = $75,000/ 0.62 mile = $120,967.75/ 1 mile Now I can use a proportion to find the price of 30,000 miles of reef construction: $120,967.75/1mi  =  $X/ 30,000mi    (cross multiply)    X= $3,629,032,500 or about 3.6 billion dollarsB.) Time the plan needs to pay itself offIm my evidence from Accuweather given above, the median cost of a hurricane is 9 billion dollars and the average is 1.8 billion (dont understand the differenc but thats what they said) this means that if one hurricane with the median price range strikes (9b), then the plan has paid for itself 2.5x over! even if a hurricane with the average cost strikes (1.8b) the plan is paid off by only 2 hurricanes. This sharply contrasts con's evidence stating that the plan will take hundred of years. Keep in mind that the biggest hurricanes like Hurricane Katrina costes the US about 125 billion dollars in revenue.But how long will it take for those hurricanes to strike?Dina Spector, 8-29-2012, 'When Will The Next Nightmare Hurricane Hit The US? 'In an average decade the mainland U.S. gets hit with about seven Category 1 hurricanes, four to five hurricanes that rank as Category 2 and about the same number that hit as Category 3 hurricanes, but just one Category 4 hurricane.'That's 1.7 hurricanes per year meaning the plan will almost certainly be paid of in less than 2 and half years.II. Fails to Protect all states A.) Con has misinterprited the plan textCon has stated that I must exclude all states I didn’t list in the plan from having coral construction done on them however this is simply untrue. If I reference my plan text it clearly states that: “The plan will take place on all feasible costal states” that means that unless it is impossible or would result in the downfall of the plan, those states will be constructed on.III. Trade DisadvantageA.) False evidence Con predicates his entire argument on one ship that is currently stuck in okinawa, not only does this Not prove that ships will Always get stuck, it also doesnt neccisarily apply to Mineral Accretion Coral Reefs because they are different things. In order for this argument to remain con must prove that mineral accretion coral reefs will cause shipping accidents using credible sources. I will also use further reasoning to show that this argument holds no substance. This is a picture of the ship off of Okinawa, it is small however if you look you can see that it is nowhere close to 12 to 30 miles off of the coast as required by the plan.It is plainly impossible for a ship to get caught on something  200-300 meters deep which is the depth of the ocean between 12-30 miles off the coast.CASE OFFENSEFurther Explanation of the Plan A.) Mineral AccretionThe plan calls for a vast area to be converted into reefs using mineral accretion. In my own words here is mineral accretion: electricity runs through a piece of metal which rests in the ocean. Through the proccesses of chemistry the electricity in the metal pulls out certain elements and compound floating around in the water which harden on the metal, usually limestone. If you have ever seen white stuff around your fosset that is the stuff that hardens on it. As it turns out the electricity and the the limestone offer corrals the energy they need to constantly grow and feed. Mineral Accretion also creates superior resilience to the effect of global warming and increases growth rates of the coral dramatically, its like corals on steroids. Now here is the technical stuff:definition of MA (mineral accretion): Mineral accretion is a new method that uses low voltage direct current electricity to grow solid limestone rock structures in the sea and accelerate the growth of corals providing homes for reef fish and protecting the shoreline. The electrical current causes minerals that are naturally dissolved in seawater to precipitate and adhere to a metal structure.The result is a composite of limestone and brucite with mechanical strength similar to concrete. Derived from seawater, this material is similar to the composition of natural coral reefs and tropical sand beaches.  In the plan the government will use industrial grade aquatic wire mesh and adhere it to the ocean, then run a current through it (1.2 volts, a AA battery has 1.5 volts) which will begin the proccesses of mineral accretion. Mineral accretion begins in just hours and will be finished within a few months, corals will then start to attach themselves to the mesh and reproduce causing a flourishing environment to grow for miles on end, with 80% of corals now dead in the caribean it is easy to see why we need this in America.But what about global warming? wont it just kill off the rest of the reefs when we plant them? No. 'Corals were grown at sites in Jamaica where all the corals in the nearby reef had been killed by algae overgrowth caused by high nutrients, and where no new coral settlement was taking place. These had coral growth rates up to three to five times the record rates for many species, and settlement of hundreds of corals per square meter (Goreau and Hilbertz, 1996).'Biorock is a technology which harnesses the same power of mineral accretion, they have used their technology in certain areas and seen amazing results:'Corals grown in the Maldives on Biorock structures had 50-80% survival from the severe high temperature bleaching events that killed 95-99% of the corals on surrounding reefs (Goreau, Hilbertz, Hakeem and Hameed, 2000). Survival of Biorock corals was from 16 to 50 times greater than surrounding habitats (Figure 1). A large population of corals was being grown in the same habitat using conventional cementing methods and being used as controls to compare growth'  B.) Previous ArgumentsPlease note the the opponent has conceeded the humanitarian benifits of the plan such as cures and further innovations for disease and the amount of lives we save by implimenting coral reefsSummary: We have deterined the cost of the plan to be 3.6 billion dollars which will repay itself within no more than 2 and a half years, furthermore we have discredited con's second argument because he simply misinterprited the plan text. On Con's final disadvantage he states that implementing MA reefs will halt all trade however he doesnt have substantial evidence to support this claim and I have shown that all MA reefs will be well below the depth of passing ships. After concluding this things I moved away from Defense contentions to Offense contentions where I supported the strength and full out solvency of the plan while also explaining some of its details furthermore the con has conceeded that implimenting MA reefs will lead to cures for a plethora of diseases while also saving thousands of lives from hurricane mortalility. I look forward to the next round and I now pass the gauntlet to Con to craft his responses...</t>

Thus the plan should still happen given that the opponent’s argument is true, which it is not.        1.)    Yet again con has attempted to re-read the plan and ignore what is plainly clear but let me just use solvency evidence which cancels out con’s claim:     “Large-scale habitat restoration of degraded areas is now the only hope for recovery of the coastal fisheries, biodiversity, sand supplies, and shore protection that only large healthy reefs can provide. Unless the vast wastelands of degraded reefs are restored, all tropical coastal countries will soon face crippling economic losses. Unfortunately, at this time there is no serious funding for large-scale coral reef restoration”   “When considered as earnings per kilometer of reefs, the values for fisheries and for tourism typically ranged from several thousand dollars to several million dollars per kilometer of reef per year”   Thus please extend the fisheries argument     Tourism   1.)   Tourism is never mandated in the plan 2.)   Con must provide case specific evidence that tourism hurts Mineral Accretion Coral Reefs for it to be a real disadvantage  3.)   Con simply states that tourism can bring bad health but never states how bad of degradation this causes and thus there is not significance to his claim   Con has done literally nothing bad exaggerate, lie, and attempt to ruin the educational value of the round as far as I am concerned and it is shown clearly in his mannerism and clear disregard for the fairness of the round. I have effectively shown why con has been abusive, and why his claims are unfounded. He has yet to provide a solidly grounded argument and thus I can only see the round leaning my way right now. I pass the turn back to con for a hopefully educational round.</t>

    <t>The cons argument will flow as follows: Cost State protection Trade Case offense answers Hurts biodiversity   Cost The pro's claim that the demand by con to protect their case rather than amend it during a debate is invalid. As this is a policy debate, the entire point of this is to evaluate the Affirmative team plan to see if it is viable. These are not strict limitations by the con but rather a standard rule that is seen in policy debate. Were this something such as a Congressional debate, the pros actions of amendment would be perfectly fine; however, this is not the case. Pro then goes on to claim that the con is now fabricating prices. However, all the con did was replace the shortened amount of miles that the pro decided to use with the actual amount in the plan text. Therefore, the cons numbers is the only valid amount between the two sides. The pro came up with a new cost in this round, claiming that the final amount is 8.1 billion dollars, which still far exceeds their budget. To put this plainly, the USFG cannot create something that takes more resources than they give. The pros plan calls for a budget of 225 million dollars, the con has proven that the actual cost is significantly higher and pro, even when trying to cut the amount of land protected, still far exceeds their budget. Finally, addressing the breakwaters, pro has not proven that the cons definition is false. As the con has taken their own plan text and compared it to a definition, proving that these artificial reefs are technically breakwaters, con must assume the worst-case scenario and give the maximum cost estimate. State protection Pro refuses to answer the state protection as they claim that this is simply semantics. The con will reiterate that this is Policy debate. In this form of debate, we evaluate the pros plan, or policy. As their plan text explicitly defines the states to be evaluated, this plan is exposing states that the pros evidence shows are under threat from hurricanes. Trade Pro asked for proof that the ships would be running aground, the con will point to the Great Barrier Reef, a reef that has grown to be the largest of its kind in the world. These reefs obviously will present a danger to our shipping industry. As they grow to surround our nation, ships will hit them, causing massive amounts of environmental damage. Hurts biodiversity The pro claims that this will help the industries of fishing, tourism and coastal protection. However, the con will prove that the first two are short term at best (the coastal protection part is covered in State protection). Starting with fishing, the pros evidence on fisheries proves that the fishing industry destroys biodiversity. areas are too severely degraded to allow recovery of corals, fish, and invertebrates to former levels because the habitat quality is so badly degraded that reefs have lost most of their carrying capacity for these species. Even if every reef was strictly protected and all fishermen were eliminated today, the fisheries would still not be able to recover to former levels. There is no doubt that over-fishing has been disastrous almost everywhere (Pauly et al.,1998; 2000) This alone invalidates their solvency. Over-fishing has destroyed coral reefs. No matter how many we build, unless over fishing is addressed, artificial coral reefs will have to be rebuilt, as the marine life that usually inhabits them is dead or dying. Moving on to tourism, the con will reference material in the evidence below. Tourism may provide a small economic boost, however this will be short lived. As tourism hurts reefs in addition to overfishing, it may become difficult to keep them coming back when the reefs are skeletons from all the damage done by humans. Recreational activities also have a huge impact. For example, careless boating, diving, snorkeling, and fishing have substantially damaged coral reefs in many parts of the world, through people touching reefs, stirring up sediment, and dropping anchors. [Sic] The plan fails to address the dangers of human interaction with these reefs, so one must assume that the same dangers will apply. This means an increase in many factors including, but not limited to, seafood consumption, disturbing animals such as whales and sharks, and pollution. Therefore, this is not an advantage at all and flows con.</t>

    <t>The cons arguments will flow as follows. AnalyticsCostState protectionTrade disadvantageAnalyticsThe fact that the plan was premed does not excuse a lack of familiarity with the subject by the affirmative. The pro, in this debate, is expected to provide a plan and defend it. They may not claim that they copy-pasted this and therefore should receive leniency.CostFirst off is that the con will not let the changing of costs stand. Insofar that the plan defines a specific amount of coastline to protect and the pro may not simply amend their plan in the middle of the debate. This destroys educational value and makes it flat out impossible for the con to win when the pro may patch holes at will.The con will also observe that these new claims from the affirmative very much exceed the 225 million dollars that the plan originally allocates to this endeavour. Using this in tandem with the first cost argument, this raises the cost of the affirmatives plan using their equation to $7,968,666,800; something that is significantly greater than what was allocated in the funding and even claimed in the previous response by the pro.Moving onwards, the plan calls for artificial breakwaters.  'Coral reefs serve as an effective first line of defense to incoming waves, storms and rising seas,' said Dr. Michael Beck, lead marine scientist of The Nature Conservancy and a co-author of the study[sic]This is directly from the plan, falling under the definition of a breakwater.  breakwater: a wall that is built out into the sea to protect a harbor or beach from the force of waves. Therefore, as the DOI evidence does not explicitly limit the use of mineral accretion, the cons numbers of over 1 Trillion USD still stands. The pro tries to use Katrina as an example, claiming that over 100 billion dollars in damage is to be expected. From their evidence, the con recovered two lines that negate this.   -There were also engineering problems. Katrina was especially damaging because the levees designed to protect the below-sea-level city burst under the hurricane's 25-foot high storm surge. -Since 2005, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has spent $14.5 billion to improve New Orleans' system of levees, floodwalls, pump stations and surge barriers.Therefore, this is irrelevant as the USFG has already solved this issue Pouring money in to a fixed problem is a waste of money that the pro must justify under their plan text. State protectionThe pro is twisting the plan text instead of defending it. The verbatim text is as follows: -The plan will take place on all feasible costal states: (California, Louisiana, Texas, South Caronlina, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, New Jersey, and Maine) are all up for considerationThis explicitly defines the states to be considered, con arguments still stand.Trade disadvantage The pro has provided no evidence stating that this is not a real risk. In fact, all the pro side has done on this subjectis claim that the con is presenting false evidence without providing counter evidence. As the pro has the BoP, it is their duty in this debate to prove the validity of their case.However, the con will present two more examples of ship groundings on coral reefs .Summary The pro has failed to provide acceptable measures on cost, even changing their plan to come up with a cost that is well over their budget. In addition, Pro has not proven that the other states will be protected. Finally, Pro has not fulfilled their Burden of Proof to show that US naval trade is in no danger. As it stands, the United States of America stands to lose over a trillion dollars with billions more lost in trade.</t>

    <t>The flow of the debate will be as follows: Inherencies with the plan Analytics DA – Cost DA – Fails to protect states DA – Blocks ships   Analytics The affirmative fails to provide an agent of action, merely claiming that they will substantially increase investment in the use of mineral accretion. In addition, they fail to say who will enforce the execution of this project and the source of this funding. Without these three critical parts, the plan cannot move forward as there is no assignment to any department in the United States Federal Government to begin work on this plan. DA – Cost The median cost for building artificial breakwaters is USD $19,791 per meter, compared to $1,290 per meter for coral reef restoration projects. U.S. Department of the Interior 5/13/2014. The affirmative is using faulty calculations according to their own evidence. The con will break down the actual cost of construction according to the Affirmative’s evidence. The first step is the conversion of the miles that the plan calls for to meters. This results in a calculation of 49,515 miles being equal to 79,686,668 meters. After that the con multiplied the converted number by the cost per meter to achieve a final number of 1,577,078,846,338 or One Trillion –five hundred and seventy seven Billion – seventy eight million – eight hundred and forty six thousand – three hundred and thirty eight dollars. This is exponentially higher than the affirmatives claim of a mere 225 million dollars. 2014 The usfederalbudget.us site provides a relatively simple breakdown of the US budget which is 17,704.4 billion dollars or 17.704 trillion dollars. The actual cost of this plan is roughly 9 percent of the entire federal budget. The Con requires that the Affirmative fulfill their burden of proof in showing that the government can take this absolutely staggering blow. The Affirmative is charged with providing the source of this money as this cannot be ignored. Furthermore, let’s compare this cost to the Average cost per hurricane provided by the Affirmative. It would take slightly over 175 hurricanes that do 9 billion dollars in damage a piece to justify the cost of this enormous project. Atlantic Hurricane Season 2014 Kristen Rodman – May 18, 2014 With roughly 10 named tropical storms, five hurricanes and two major hurricanes predicted for the Atlantic Basin this season, AccuWeather.com's long-range forecasting team anticipates two storms, either tropical storms or hurricanes, to make landfall in the United States. With the 2014 year being so inactive and NOAA showing that there has been 60 hurricanes per 100 years, it will be over 200 years before this plan generates a net-profit. The Affirmative must justify this long term investment in the face of technological advances out dating their plan.   DA – Fails to protect states Mississippi, Alabama, Oregon, Washington, New York, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Delaware, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Hawaii. What do all of these states have in common? They’ve been hit by hurricanes and yet are not protected by the Affirmative plan. As the Affirmative failed to clarify the exclusion of these places, it must be assumed that they have been unintentionally left out and therefore will suffer the consequences of this ill written plan. DA – Blocks ships A U.S. Navy container ship remained stuck on a coral reef near Okinawa for a second day Friday.January 23, 2015 – Frances Burns Coral reefs block ship movement. Ships trying to cross them, as proven by my evidence, get grounded and are even damaged. Agricultural exports in 2013 amounted to 320 billion dollars and supported over one million jobs. This proves that Ocean trade is important historically, presently and in to the future. This plan would destroy US trade which, in 2000, shipped 736 billion dollars in that single year. Compared to the cost of the plan and the long term investment required to get anything out if it, it’s apparent that the economically destructive artificial coral reefs blocking shipping cannot be justified. In summary, the face value cost of the plan is staggering. That’s not even including billions of dollars in lost trade as ships cannot make it to other countries, being pinned in by the new reefs. Lastly, the plan fails to protect all states that are actually hit by hurricanes, bringing in to question as to states with major population centers such as New York are not covered. This plan requires elaboration and revision in order to give it a chance of consideration.</t>

    <t>I thank my opponent for his arguments, and his speedy response. The framework was depicted thoroughly in the first round, so the framework for the second round will be skipped. I will attempt to address my opposition's short argument, for there are ten thousand characters. May I also point out my opponent has already conceded to a rise in temperature from 1979-1998. I will skip right to the debate.   ==Recent Land Temperatures==   I will start with a straightforward argument, one that is quite often set forward by the pro on this debate topic. To see if the global temperature really is rising, we must look at the big picture, not just data collected from the last ten years. The reason for this is because, as every intelligent scientist knows, the temperature on the Earth is quite unstable, and often affected by sunspots. When the solar activity ceases, periods known as 'maunder minimums' tend to occur. According to one Professor Lockwood, the sun's activity is falling off at a pace not seen in 10,000 years [1]. This happened around 1995-2000, which would explain why the Earth's temperature seems to be 'cooling,' as my opponent argued.    In fact, Drew T. Shindell found that these minimums in solar activity can shave 0.3-0.4 degrees Celsius off of Earth's overall temperature [2]. The study conducted by Shindell found that in the last Maunder Minimum (1600-1700, roughly,) temperatures were widely affected.   'Modeled global annual average surface temperatures were 0.34°C cooler in 1680 than in 1780 [2].'     [6] Since it has been established that the sudden 'stoppage' of global warming can be explained due to sunspots and minimal activity, we can now look at the temperature over the last 50 to 100 years. This is roughly when greenhouse gases skyrocketed, which is believed to be the main cause of global warming. I would also like to state that the graph my opponent set forward was obviously sawed, and came from a non-trustworthy source [3]. My opponent's graph showed two of the following things:   1) Temperature over a 15 year period   2) A slight (possible) temperature fall that can EASILY be accounted to the drop off in solar activity. Also, the graph itself shows the major temperature imbalance, with temperature imbalance reaching up to 1.10 degrees Fahrenheit during 2008, which is minor compared to the 1.30 degree imbalance in 1998.   Results from a much more trustworthy link, NASA, show that temperatures from 1880-2000 (before the drop-off in solar activity) steadily rose 0.8-1 degrees Celsius [4]. Not so coincidentally, methane and carbon dioxide have skyrocketed according to samples taken from both North and South Pole ice [4].   'Despite ups and downs from year to year, global average surface temperature is rising. By the beginning of the 21st century, Earth’s temperature was roughly 0.5 degrees Celsius above the long-term (1951–1980) average.' -Goddard Institute for Space Studies and NASA.  In this graph, we see a variety of different things. First, there is a high imbalance between temperatures. However, we can also observe that the Earth's mean surface temperature has inclined, though not necessarily in a straight line. The data shown by this graph depicts that the temperature of the Earth is rising at a steeper rate over time, which coincides with the increased Co2 emissions over the past decades [5]. It has been shown that the globe is warming (insofar) on land. This satisfies one of the definitions of global warming, which is that the globe is warming on land. As of now, part of the resolution is negated. On to the second part, which will be a rise in oceanic temperatures. ==Oceanic Temperatures== My opponent shows an increase in the polar ice caps (which, as I remind the audience, comes from a non-trustworthy link,) but does not show the size or temperature of any other part of the ocean. It seems like the opponent is focusing on little things that seem to go against global warming, so I will try to look at the big picture. For now, there are graphs explaining the sudden increase in Arctic Ice, such as the following [7]:  As the graph shows above, there has been a general warming across most of the worlds' oceans, which coincides with the atmospheric temperature. In response to the increase in Arctic Ice, we can see there is an isolated spot of cooling, but it is not generally a statistically significant trend. However, the Southern Atlantic Ocean has seen a two degree to a four degree increase in temperature (surface-wise.)Once again, we must look at the big picture. The possible increase in Arctic Ice (from August 2012 to August 2013) could be due to limited sun energy, an anomaly in unstable temperatures, etc. However, much like surface temperatures, the ice/temperature is very rocky, but it is clearly on a downward trend [8]. In fact, the data shows that there is a 3.2% decrease in ice per decade. What con also fails to show is the thickness of the ice, for an increase of thin ice does not necessarily coincide with lowering temperatures.Despite a rise in ice over the past two years, the oceans are undoubtedly hotter and the ice is still quite low. In the same year (2013) as the NASA satellite image was taken, the following statement was concluded:'October ice volume was around 20,000 cubic kilometers (approximately 4,800 cubic miles), meaning that ice volume in October 2013 still ranks among the lowest of the past 30 years.' -National Snow and Ice Data Center. To sum this rebuttal/argument up, we can see there is a small, normal spike around 2012-2013, and then a continuous downward trend from thereafter. In response to the Kevin Trenberth e-mail that my opponent pointed out, I would like to show what the E-mail actually said and meant.'Global warming is still happening - our planet is still accumulating heat. But our observation systems aren't able to comprehensively keep track of where all the energy is going. Consequently, we can't definitively explain why surface temperatures have gone down in the last few years. That's a travesty!' -Kevin Trenberth, ©2009.==Overview of Next Round==I will end this round here having satisfied the definition of 'global warming' and refuted my opponent's arguments. Of course, all of my evidence is very far from being stated. This was just an outline of what my case will look like. In the next round, I will go into further details concerning the following:-Changes in Migration-Animal Behavior-Hottest years on record-Density of Arctic Ice-Co2 Emissions-Glacial RetractionIn conclusion, all my opponent did was falsely state an E-mail and use biased evidence from a non-trustworthy link. He has also conceded that there was a period of warming, and stated a temperature WITHOUT evidence. I ask my opponent link me to his NASA Remote Sensing Systems that says there was an 0.36 degree Fahrenheit climb, because my graphs (which are must trustworthy) state an entirely different story.I thank my opponent for his time, and return the table to him. Good luck. </t>

    <t>==Framework==Before anything, I would like to address the opposition's arguments. He has copied and pasted (literally) in both of his arguments. He has cited where he got the information from, but he has not made any arguments of his own. Furthermore, I have refuted everything he stated from his first link, which shows he is using biased and unprofessional links to copy information from. I ask that he make his OWN arguments instead of just asking me to refute cold information from a website.The con side has not even refuted or responded to any of my arguments. I remind the reader that these points remain dropped by the con until such time as he is bold enough to actually refute them. Insofar, he has dropped the following four major points, all of which are vital to the resolution:-Surface temperatures are heating up-Hiatus in global warming is due to limited sun-Ocean temperatures are heating up-Increase in Arctic ice can be easily explainedHe has also dropped many other more minor points, but the above are the ones that are worth bringing up. Without further ado, I will refute my opponent's 'arguments' and discredit his source. Afterwhich, I will add more evidence to support that the globe is heating up. This should solidify the resolution to the point where I should be able to win the debate. Let's begin.==Global Temperatures are being Adjusted==My opponent states that global temperatures are being adjusted to show a warming trend. However, even while looking over his source, no strong scientific evidence supports this empty claim. He states that adjustments in temperatures were made by Goddard and the Institute for Space Studies, without any evidence, data, or a study shown. Since this seems like a disagreement between data sources as to what the temperature really is, I have found a graph showing what disagreement in temperature 'really' looks like [1]. As is shown, practically all of the major temperature recording studios agree on the temperature change. To state that each temperature station doctors their results in an almost unanimous faction without any evidence is clearly absurd, borderline insane. My opponent's article states that NOAA and NASA doctor their results significantly. However, JMA and MOHC seem to correlate with the findings, as well as almost all other temperature recording studios. In a review of over 10.5 thousand articles on global warming in 2013, it was found that only two of the articles questioned human involvement, and none presented an alternative theory [2]. It seems essentially irrefutable that scientists agree on almost all aspects of global warming. There is clearly no scandal here, and the Earth is clearly warming. I challenge my opponent to show me a graph from a highly trusted source that shows the global temperature going down instead of going up. Until such time, this point is refuted. ==Arctic Ice==Once again, the thickness of Arctic ice is mainly what matters, not the quantity, hence the saying 'quality is better than quantity.' Though Arctic ice could appear to be going up, the thickness and luster is on a downward trend not seen before [3]. The total volume of Arctic Sea ice was lowest between 2007 and 2008, as reported by Maslowski in 2010 (PDF.) People who argue that Arctic and Icelandic ice is going up are merely focusing on a thin, almost nonexistent, layer at the top. But what they fail to notice is that ice is going down at a significant rate.For good measure, I will post another graph explaining the lack of correlation regarding high temperatures and an increase in ice [4].It was found the increase in Antarctic Sea Ice was due to a number of factors, as argued by various sources:'One [factor] is the drop in ozone levels over Antarctica. The hole in the ozone layer above the South Pole has caused cooling in the stratosphere (Gillet 2003). This strengthens the cyclonic winds that circle the Antarctic continent (Thompson 2002). The wind pushes sea ice around, creating areas of open water known as polynyas. More polynyas lead to increased sea ice production (Turner 2009).'Henceforth, it is blatantly obvious that an increase in Arctic Sea ice does not necessarily correlate with lowering temperatures, for there are many things to take into account. However, it has been shown that volume of ice is coinciding with rising temperatures. To sum up, we can see the Arctic ice volume is lowering, sea temperatures are rising, sources can be trusted, and my opponents' source shows no evidence of its' preposterous claim. The resolution that Global Warming exists is, insofar, affirmed.==Animal Behavior==Even if, in some event, we could not trust the graphs, there is natural evidence to back up the fact that global warming exists and is happening. For example, animals are migrating, hibernating, and swimming earlier than usual. This is clearly visible through the behavior of the marmot. Their hibernation cycle is ending three weeks earlier due to rising temperatures [5][6]. In a study by Terry Root, published on journal, surprising results regarding animal behavior were found.'Out of the nearly 1,500 species examined, the researchers found that about 1,200 exhibited temperature-related changes consistent with what scientists would expect if they were being affected by global warming [7].'These changes have occurred in history, but no changes have been as rapid as the ones we are seeing today. In retrospect, the temperature change is the most rapid in history. It is clear as day that animal hibernation is being effected by rising temperatures due to global warming. Furthermore, there is a conspicuous change in the migration pattern of various birds and animals. These animals and birds are migrating further up north (where it is much colder) due to the rising temperatures across the globe [8].The migration of many animals, most notably the wild turkey, cannot be ignored in any stance. Since 1966, the turkey has migrated an additional 468 miles due northeast, all while the temperatures in the United States (avg. January) rose due to global warming. In addition to both hibernating and migrating, animals are nesting and hatching earlier (most specifically, birds.) This is due to warmer springs [9][10]. To solidify these claims of warming, we will look into the hottest years on record.==Hottest Years on Record==a. If global warming is happening, recent years should be the hottest on record.b. Recent years are the hottest on record.c. Global Warming is happening.This logic is backed up with findings from Climate Central [11.]Due to the fact that my opponent neglected to respond to any of my previous arguments, and copied and pasted information from a website, I will end my arguments for this round right here. I return the table to him and wish him luck. </t>

    <t>today I was on my favorite news website... the Drudge Report, if you don't know what that is it is an uncensored news website that tells the truth and inst being choked by the government. one of the headlines was 'PAPER: 'GLOBAL WARMING' BIGGEST SCIENCE SCANDAL EVER... '. I read the article, it stated that 'When future generations look back on the global-warming scare of the past 30 years, nothing will shock them more than the extent to which the official temperature records ' on which the entire panic ultimately rested ' were systematically 'adjusted' to show the Earth as having warmed much more than the actual data justified.' Homewood checked a swathe of other South American weather stations around the original three. In each case he found the same suspicious one-way 'adjustments'. First these were made by the US government's Global Historical Climate Network. They were then amplified by two of the main official surface records, the Goddard Institute for Space Studies and the National Climate Data Center, which use the warming trends to estimate temperatures across the vast regions of the Earth where no measurements are taken. Yet these are the very records on which scientists and politicians rely for their belief in 'global warming'.Homewood has now turned his attention to the weather stations across much of the Arctic, between Canada (51 degrees W) and the heart of Siberia (87 degrees E). Again, in nearly every case, the same one-way adjustments have been made, to show warming up to 1 degree C or more higher than was indicated by the data that was actually recorded. This has surprised no one more than Traust Jonsson, who was long in charge of climate research for the Iceland met office (and with whom Homewood has been in touch). Jonsson was amazed to see how the new version completely 'disappears' Iceland's 'sea ice years' around 1970, when a period of extreme cooling almost devastated his country's economy. One of the first examples of these 'adjustments' was exposed in 2007 by the statistician Steve McIntyre, when he discovered a paper published in 1987 by James Hansen, the scientist (later turned fanatical climate activist) who for many years ran Giss. Hansen's original graph showed temperatures in the Arctic as having been much higher around 1940 than at any time since. But as Homewood reveals in his blog post, 'Temperature adjustments transform Arctic history', Giss has turned this upside down. Arctic temperatures from that time have been lowered so much that that they are now dwarfed by those of the past 20 years.Homewood's interest in the Arctic is partly because the 'vanishing' of its polar ice (and the polar bears) has become such a poster-child for those trying to persuade us that we are threatened by runaway warming. But he chose that particular stretch of the Arctic because it is where ice is affected by warmer water brought in by cyclical shifts in a major Atlantic current ' this last peaked at just the time 75 years ago when Arctic ice retreated even further than it has done recently. The ice-melt is not caused by rising global temperatures at all. Of much more serious significance, however, is the way this wholesale manipulation of the official temperature record ' for reasons GHCN and Giss have never plausibly explained ' has become the real elephant in the room of the greatest and most costly scare the world has known. This really does begin to look like one of the greatest scientific scandals of all time. this proves my point by using factual evidence provided by this article.</t>

    <t>my opponent seems to be getting mad for no reason... like a typical american citizen that believes everything the government tells them... How have we come to be told that global temperatures have suddenly taken a great leap upwards to their highest level in 1,000 years? In fact, it has been no greater than their upward leaps between 1860 and 1880, and 1910 and 1940, as part of that gradual natural warming since the world emerged from its centuries-long 'Little Ice Age' around 200 years ago.This belief has rested entirely on five official data records. Three of these are based on measurements taken on the Earth's surface, versions of which are then compiled by Giss, by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and by the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit working with the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction, part of the UK Met Office. The other two records are derived from measurements made by satellites, and then compiled by Remote Sensing Systems in California and the University of Alabama, Huntsville. One of the more provocative points arising from the debate over those claims that 2014 was 'the hottest year evah' came from the Canadian academic Dr Timothy Ball when, in a recent post on WUWT, he used the evidence of ice-core data to argue that the Earth's recent temperatures rank in the lowest 3 per cent of all those recorded since the end of the last ice age, 10,000 years ago. In reality, the implications of such distortions of the data go much further than just representing one of the most bizarre aberrations in the history of science. The fact that our politicians have fallen for all this scary chicanery has given Britain the most suicidally crazy energy policy (useless windmills and all) of any country in the world.</t>

    <t>According to NASA's own data via Remote Sensing Systems , the world has warmed a mere .36 degrees Fahrenheit over the last 35 years (they started measuring the data in 1979) however, that does mean the world is warmer, right? The problem with that argument is that we experienced the bulk of that warming between 1979 and 1998 . . . since then, we've actually had temperatures dropping. as a matter of a fact the north polar ice cap is increasing in size. In recent satellite images from NASA there is at least a 43% increase in size.Leaked emails from global warming scientists state that the Earth is not warming, such as this one from Kevin Trenberth that states, 'The fact is that we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty we can't.'It is becoming harder and harder for the global warming community to ignore some of the scientific data that show the Earth is not getting warmer . . . instead, the world is getting cooler.</t>

    <t>Global Warming is Happening and we will die if something is not done, NOW!  More CO2 will lead to hotter climate that causes sea/water level to rise and ice melts, which leads to worldwide sea levels increased 4-10 inches in the last century. Climate changes which cause extreme storms, tsunami, typhoons, flooding, land covered with water steer towards the damaging of plants and human population. In the end the earth is hotter and bluer where it is not capable of any life. The study of ice cores from Greenland from 1000 years back show that there was less CO2 production than today. Extreme heat and drought causing people to die or have heat strokes and lead to rise in sea level which caused flooding. This also concludes that last 20 years have been the warmest years. In Europe at the year 2003, 30,000 people died from heat waves.</t>

    <t>Greetings. The arguments you are presenting are common among the left side of the political spectrum over the issue of Global Warming/Climate Change. The negation of this debate will now provide eight points as to why the public has been mislead over the complexities of this issue:  1. The 20th century warming of 1-1.4'F is within the +/- 5'F range of the past 3,000 years. A 2003 study by researchers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics shows temperatures from 1000-1100 AD (before fossil fuel use) that are comparable to those from 1900-1990.  2. Rising CO2 levels are a result of global warming, not a cause of it. As temperatures increase, CO2 is released from 'carbon sinks' such as the oceans or the Arctic tundra. Measurements of ice core samples show that over the last four climactic cycles (past 240,000 years) periods of global warming preceded global increases in CO2.  3. Human releases of CO2 cannot cause climate change as any increases in CO2 are eventually balanced by nature. CO2 gets absorbed by oceans, forests, and other 'carbon sinks' that increase their biological activity to absorb excess CO2 from the atmosphere. 50% of the CO2 released by the burning of fossil fuels and other human activities, has already been absorbed.  4. Global warming and cooling are caused by fluctuations in the sun's heat (solar forcing), not by the minor greenhouse effect of human-produced gases such as CO2 and methane. Between 1900 and 2000 solar irradiance increased .19%. This increase correlates with the rise in surface temperatures in the US.  5. Due to the inherent unpredictability of climate systems it is impossible to accurately use models to determine future weather. Climate models have been unable to simulate major known features of past climate such as the ice ages or the very warm climates of the Miocene, Eocene, and Cretaceous periods. If models cannot replicate past climate changes they should not be trusted to predict future climate changes.  6. Rising temperatures are caused primarily by water vapor, the most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, not by CO2. Water vapor concentrations in the atmosphere are driven by natural storm systems and ocean currents. According to a Mar. 5, 2010 study by researchers at NOAA, water vapor in the stratosphere was responsible for increasing the rate of warming during the 1990s by 30%.  7. The increased hurricane activity over the past decade (1995-2005), including hurricane Katrina, is not the result of human-induced climate change; it is the result of cyclical tropical cyclone patterns, driven primarily by natural ocean currents, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) testimony in the US Senate on Sep. 20, 2005.  8. Deep ocean currents cause climate warming and cooling in long term cycles. The minor greenhouse effect of human produced CO2 pales in comparison. Global cooling from 1940 to the 1970s, and warming from the 1970s to 2008, coincided with fluctuations in ocean currents and cloud cover driven by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) - a naturally occurring rearrangement in atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns.</t>

    <t>Let it be known that the affirmation side in this debate failed to refute any of my eight critical points that I made during the first round of the debate:  But anyway, my opponent brings up data claiming the fact that the Earth is currently warmer than it was a BILLION years ago. Considering that in the last billion years, multicellular life began, multicellular life left the seas and came upon land, the dinosaurs lived and died, and we net through two ice ages, using that range for data does not get any point whatsoever across.  Humans have adapted and lived through about 500 centuries of varying climates and animals surrounding us. Global warming and cooling has occurred at periodic levels throughout the history of planet Earth. We adapted then, and this was far before the massive technological achievement that mankind has attained in recent history. When nature tries to hit us, we hit back harder.  My opponent also fails to provide any evidence of climate change affecting the ownership and operation of modern business and how exactly the warming of the globe will affect these corporate institutions. The opponent also cites an increase of tsunamis due to warming temperatures, but this is simply impossible, considering that a tsunami is formed by a geological event and not one of climatical origins.  I urge a negative vote in this debate.</t>

    <t>Global Warming has been highly exaggerated. If you understand climate you should realize there are much more aspects to our atmosphere than CO2 caused by humans . CO2 caused by humans make up less than 4 percent of the C02 in our atmosphere yet politicians believe that we are to blame and that we must try to save the planet through some sort of carbon tax which while magically make the climate change. The simple facts are that CO2 is a RESULT of temperature changes NOT a cause. The climate graphs prove this. There is a 100 year gap in some places between temperatures rises and then the proceeding CO2 rises. The facts are that the majority of CO2 comes from the ocean. When the ocean temperatures rise more CO2 comes off the ocean. Global warming alarmist simply don't take into account the fact that natural causes have produced temperatures to be much higher than they were today and CO2 levels where radically higher thousands of years ago before humans had any impact on the planet. Im not saying the greenhouse effect doesn;t happen or that humans don't have any effect on the climate, what im suggesting is that after a 16 year 'pause' in temperature increases yet human CO2 has gone up greatly in the last decade leads me to believe there is much more to go into the climate change than humans driving SUV and the climate is much more complicated than politicians say it is. All Im saying is I believe this debate should continue because skeptics do have good points.</t>

    <t>I accept this challenge and note that I'll be playing devil's advocate for a challenge. Let's start this off lightly with one argument:If global warming does not occur, then why has the rate of CO2 rose so fastly, out of the ordinary, completely unaffected by climate changes? If you look at the graph below, there is an exponential humongous rise in CO2 ever since the Industrial Revolution. Even looking at the bigger picture, with the previous patterns of CO2 rising and falling, this new rise is very irregular. My opponent has failed ot use any sources to support his mere assertions. He did not use any evidence to support how 'temperature does not change' due to global warming. The temperature rise is very unnatural. And then, to go back and compare the temperature since the industrial revolution to before the industrial revolution. As you can see industry (made by man) is a huge contribution to global warming, and polluting of CO2. It is definitely a problem, and definitely not a waste of our time or money. We need to fix this irregularity as soon as possible.I now rest my case, and give the floor to my opponent.</t>

    <t>Thank you Con for starting this debate. I hope to have an interesting and civil dialogue with you. Introduction At first I was unsure if I wanted to take part in this debate. This is because the word 'better' was not clearly defined. By better one could mean that an omnivore diet has tastier food, is more convenient, and for that reason it should be considered 'better.' However, I'm going to interpret the word better to mean that a vegan lifestyle is superior to an omnivore one for various reasons. With that said, let me begin.Definition of veganism according to the Vegan Society: Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose. [1]Veganism is Kinder Towards Animals This, I think, is pretty obvious. In order for animal products to be produced, animals must be exploited. In modern animal agriculture we confine animals for their entire lives and make them miserable. They are denied proper veterinary care, free space to move around and exercise, appropriate social interaction with members of their species, and anesthesia during the process of castration and other mutilations. Once these animals reach market weight, they are sent to a slaughterhouse where they are hung upside down and have their throat slit. In 2013, a USDA inspector at a chicken slaughterhouse pointed out that: '[Workers] are literally throwing the birds into the shackles, often breaking their legs as they do it... They are working so fast, they sometimes get just one leg in the shackles. When that happens, the chickens aren't hanging right... They don't get killed, and they go into the scald tank alive.' [2]In 'Modern Meat: A Brutal Harvest,' a 2001 article from the Washington Post, a worker at a slaughterhouse for cattle describes the disturbing reality of insufficient stunning: 'It takes 25 minutes to turn a live steer into steak at the modern slaughterhouse where Ramon Moreno works. For 20 years, his post was ‘second-legger,’ a job that entails cutting hocks off carcasses as they whirl past at a rate of 309 an hour.  'The cattle were supposed to be dead before they got to Moreno. But too often they weren’t.  'They blink. They make noises,’ he said softly. ‘The head moves, the eyes are wide and looking around.’  'Still Moreno would cut. On bad days, he says, dozens of animals reached his station clearly alive and conscious. Some would survive as far as the tail cutter, the belly ripper, the hide puller.  'They die,’ said Moreno, ‘piece by piece.’ [3]To help put what I have said into perspective, I will link a short documentary by Mercy For Animals that demonstrates some of the things I have been talking about.Viewing animals as commodities for us to use for our pleasure and convenience is inhumane and disrespectful. If we think it's morally wrong to ignore the suffering of human beings, then we should also think it's morally wrong to ignore the suffering of nonhuman animals that we use for food. Veganism is Better For The Environment Animal production is a major contributor to climate change. In November of 2006 the United Nations came out with a report called ' Livestock's Long Shadow' where they explained that animal production was a bigger contributor to climate change than all of the Earth's cars, trucks, buses, airplanes, and trains combined. The ICPP, which is an intergovernmental panel on climate change, has also said:'Please eat less meat -- meat is a very carbon intensive commodity... this is something that the IPCC was afraid to say earlier, but now we have said it.' [4] According to a study in the UK, dropping meat, dairy and eggs from your diet saves 50% more carbon emissions than driving a Prius. This study showed that an average 2,000 kcal high-meat diet has 2.5 times as many greenhouse gas emissions as an average vegan diet. [5] The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has also said that raising animals for food--including land used for grazing and land used to grow feed crops for farmed animals--now uses a staggering 30% of the Earth's land mass. According to Greenpeace, nearly 80% of land deforested in the Amazon is now used as cattle pasture. [6] Veganism is A Superior Alternative To Fighting World Hunger In the U.S. we feed more than 70% of grain and soybeans to animals, [7] and in doing so we waste most of the food value of the grains that we're feeding them. If all the grain currently fed to livestock in the United States were consumed directly by people, the number of people who could be fed would be nearly 800 million. [8] Depending on the species, the animals may return to us somewhere between 1/10th and 1/3rd of the food value of the grains and soybeans that we put into them. So we are just wasting huge amounts of food in order to produce the large amount of animal products. It would be better and more practical if we fed our grains and soybeans to people, instead of feeding them to billions of land animals. One acre of land can yield 30,000 pounds of carrots, 40,000 pounds of potatoes or 50,000 pounds of tomatoes. However, one acre of land can yield only 250 pounds of meat, which means that a meat, dairy and egg diet is an unsuccessful way to combat world hunger, and that a vegan diet is a superior alternative. This is why Food For Life Global, the world's largest feed the hungry organization, only serves plant based food. As well as Everybody Gets Fed, Earth Save and Plenty. A Well Planned Vegan Diet is Healthy According to the American Dietetic Association, America's largest organization of health care professions:  'appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.' [9]Conclusion If we take animal welfare, the environment and world hunger into account, and ask ourselves which lifestyle is most beneficial, it seems like a vegan lifestyle is the better choice. In this paper I have provided various reasons for thinking that, and so I believe we are committed to the idea that veganism is superior. The resolution is upheld.Sources in comments</t>

    <t>Thank you Con for your opening statements.Introduction Firstly, I will begin by responding to my opponent's arguments for why a meat diet is better. Secondly, I will defend my original arguments for why veganism is better than a meat eating lifestyle.  Nature Here Con argues that humans are meant to eat meat because we have molars and K-9 teeth. This is more of a statement of fact rather than an argument for why a meat lifestyle is better than a vegan one. I really don't even have to respond to it for that reason. However, I will do so anyways. Yes, humans can eat meat but that doesn't mean that we ought to. I could go next door and eat my neighbor's newborn. His baby is, after all, made of meat like animals. However, I think we would all agree that just because I CAN do that doesn't mean that I should.  Food Chain Here Con argues that eating animals is morally permissible because animals in the wilderness eat other animals. This too, is not an argument for why a meat diet is better than a vegan one. However, I will respond to it anyway. Yes, animals in the wild eat other animals, but this is more of a statement of fact rather than an argument. It seems like you're saying that because animals do that, it must be morally permissible for humans to do so as well. This is seriously problematic, because if we start to derive our moral values from what other animals do, then many things can no longer be consider immoral. Rape, infanticide, aggressive fights, ect. are all things that occur in the animal kingdom. Do we really want to say that because other animals do these things that we ourselves should be allowed to do them as well? I think not. Nutrition Here Con argues that meat is superior to plants when it comes to getting protein. He didn't exactly explain how it's superior. So for now, I will dismiss his claim. Taste Here Con argues that meat is one of the tastiest parts of the meal. This, I think, is kind of subjective. There are many people who do not like the taste of meat, and who prefer other foods. Con mistakenly thinks that all vegans eat is vegetables. This is untrue, because pretty much every food can be made vegan. Even things like meat. Whole grains, beans, nuts, seeds, pasta, pizza, lentils, tofu, tempeh, seitan, ect. are just a few of the many foods out there for people abstaining from animal products.  The Individual or Society?Con says that my arguments are simply stating that a vegan society is better, and that it is not addressing the individual person. And therefore my arguments are not even relevant to the debate. The individual and society distinction was not made clear in the rules of the debate. It was NOT, 'A Vegan lifestyle is better than a meat-eating one for the individual,' or 'A Vegan lifestyle is better than a meat-eating one for society.' The debate topic was simply, 'A Vegan lifestyle is better than a meat-eating one.' I think Con is trying to conveniently make this distinction in the middle of the debate to make it easier for himself. However, even if I were to grant this distinction, veganism can still be shown to be better. While it's true that one person switching to a vegan diet isn't going to stop the meat industry, it does save nearly 200 animals per year [1] from the miserable existence on a modern farm. As I pointed out earlier, according to a study in the UK, dropping animal products from your diet saves 50% more carbon emissions than driving a Prius. So even if we ignore the society part of it, and instead look at it from the individual's perspective, veganism is still better. Veganism is Kinder Towards Animals Here Con argues that the animals we raise on farms are meant to be food. This is again, more of a statement of fact rather than an argument. Of course those animals are there to be killed for our food. That's why we continue to breed them on a massive scale. However, what's the moral justification for us doing this to animals? I don't see it. This statement made by Con could have also been used by a white slave owner in the 18th century. To demonstrate this, let change the word animals with Africans, and the phrase 'to be food' with 'to pick cotton.' Observe:  'The Africans we have on plantations are meant to pick cotton, would you all rather go back to picking your own cotton?'I believe Alice Walker said it best with her quote:'The animals of the world exist for their own reasons. They were not made for humans any more than black people were made for white, or women created for men.' [2]Con says that it's more mean to not buy animal flesh at the store, because by doing that the animal has died for nothing. This line of reasoning is baffling. The animal whose flesh is being sold has already died for nothing, given that we don't even need to eat meat. By purchasing that flesh you are not doing the animals a favor. All you're doing is contributing to the continued existence, prosperity, and slaughter of more animals. Veganism is Better For The Environment I already explained how vegans individually do help the environment by saving more carbon emissions, and not producing huge amounts of greenhouse gas emissions like meat eaters.  Conclusion Con has literally given no reasons to believe that an omnivore lifestyle is better than a vegan one. I, on the other hand, have given various reasons for thinking that a vegan lifestyle is best.  </t>
<h>    It was NOT, 'A Vegan lifestyle is better than a meat-eating one for the individual,' or 'A Vegan lifestyle is better than a meat-eating one for society.' The debate topic was simply, 'A Vegan lifestyle is better than a meat-eating one.'</h>

    <t>My apologies, I guess 'better' was too vague. Thanks for accepting the debate in-spite of that. I hope this will be a very fun debate.  Opening ================ I believe that an omnivore life-style is more beneficial than a vegan life-style. I hear many people say this, and I have a very strong belief on the Con side. I will provide arguments and rebut my opponent's to further support my point.  Arguments ================ 1. Nature A lot of people say that eating animals is wrong and immoral, this is incorrect. Herbivores have molars to easily chew vegetables, and carnivores have K-9 teeth (the pointy teeth, for those of you who don't know what that means) to help tear meat. Us humans, have them both. Why? Because we were meant to eat meat AND vegetables, not one or the other. This is nothing new to Earth and other animals share this trait, which leads me to my next argument.  2. Food Chain Again, people say that eating animals is immoral and wrong. I have an example of where it's perfectly ok; the wilderness. Animals eat other animals all the time. In fact, some animals only eat OTHER animals (carnivores). So humans eating meat is nothing new to nature.  3. Nutrition While a vegan diet has a slightly better nutritional value, a meat eating easily gives you protein. Yes, there are ways to get protein in vegan diets, but meat is superior when it comes to protein. If you have any desire to exercise and work out, you know that you can recover faster if you consume protein afterwards. Protein builds muscle. Athletes also eat meat, sure, it's controlled, but they still eat it. According to source [1] 'A 100 gram portion (3.5 ounces) of raw ground beef contains large amounts of Vitamin B12, B3 (Niacin), B6, Iron, Zinc, Selenium and plenty of other vitamins and minerals,' obviously meat has a lot of nutritional value  4. Taste Let's face it, meat is one of the tastiest part of the meal. Vegetables and fruits can't really live up to meat's taste. Wouldn't people like to eat something that taste good? If you had to only eat vegetables, meal time wouldn't be so good. Yes, there are some tricks to make vegetables taste better, but meat tops it all. First of all, I would like to say one argument here. Most of Pro's arguments are arguing that a vegan SOCIETY is better. We are talking about the individual here. If one were to switch to a vegan diet it wouldn't stop the meat industry. All the arguments about 'Veganism is better for the environment' or 'Veganism is a Superior Alternative To Fighting World Hunger' are not relevant to this debate. One person isn't going to stop the meat industry, so most of Pro's arguments are useless.  1. Veganism is kinder toward animals Okay, here we go. This sounds a bit mean, but it's true. The animals we raise in farms or in plantations are meant to be food, would you all rather of back to hunting for food? We may not have a successful hunt and we may starve. Sure, if you eat vegan you aren't eating the animals, but the animals is still on the shelf, useless. Isn't it meaner if you just leave the sacrifice of an animal un-used? That means that the animal died for nothing, and the meat will just rot and become useless. Sounds mean.  2. Veganism is better for the environment Again, one person isn't going to miraculously stop the meat industry. There will still be animals production. This argument doesn't explains why it's better for the individual to switch to a vegan diet.  3. Veganism is a superior alternative to fight world hunger There will still be livestock... One person isn't going to change it.  4. A well planned vegan diet is healthy While yes, vegetables are healthy for you. However, if you aren't a vegan you still eat vegetables and fruits, so you will get the nutrients you need from those foods. The only difference is that you have good tasting food and a great source of protein with an omnivore diet. </t>

    <t>Thank you Con for presenting your arguments.    Con stated in the rules at the beginning of the debate that I will not be allowed to argue in round 5. For that reason, this will be my last round to post arguments for this debate.NatureCon says that if I'm going to claim that eating animals is morally wrong, I need to provide a reason for why that is the case. In my first round of arguments of this debate, I said that it's morally wrong because it involves animal exploitation. These animals are forced to live a life full of pain and suffering. Not only that, but they are also killed prematurely at the slaughterhouse. Now, one may ask, why is it wrong to inflict pain on sentient animals? I would say it's wrong because pain is a sensation whose absence is intrinsically desired. Why is it wrong to kill sentient animals prematurely? It's wrong because it deprives them of a valuable future it could have, and thwarts the current desires they have like desires for food, sex, and being outside on a warm day. Con says that our ancestors ate meat for a long time, and that they needed to do so for survival. This is more of a statement of fact rather than an argument. However, it seems like Con is saying that because our ancestors ate meat for a long time, it is therefore morally justified. This line of argument is a fallacy, because it's an appeal to tradition. In the U.S., owning African Americans as slaves used to be a tradition. But does that mean owning other human beings was justified? No, clearly not. In the same way, just because we have been eating animals for a long time does not mean that we should continue to do so. Nutrition It's true that meat provides vitamin B12, and that this nutrient is of extreme importance. However, vegans can obtain vitamin B12 from taking a supplement or eating foods fortified with it. So meat eaters don't actually have an advantage here when it comes to B12. Con may object that if vegans have to supplement or eat foods fortified with this nutrient, this means that a vegan diet is unnatural. However, this argument would be an appeal to nature fallacy. Just because something is natural or unnatural does not mean it's good or bad. Many of the things we do nowadays could be considered unnatural. Driving a car, flying in an airplane, using a cell phone, debating others online, ect. could all be considered unnatural. As registered dietitians Jack Norris and Virginia Messina point out in their book 'Vegan for Life.''Today's commercial plant foods and meat are different from the foods available in prehistoric times. We eat hybrids of plants and we feed foods to animals that they would not normally eat. Additionally, the U.S. food supply is routinely fortified with a host of vitamins and minerals. Even those people who strive to eat a more 'natural' diet as adults have normally benefited from fortified foods as children. It is quite unlikely that anyone is eating a natural diet in today's world.' [1] I'm still not convinced that meat is a superior source of protein. Meat has cholesterol, saturated fat, and no fiber in it. However, a cup of cooked lentils has 18 grams of protein, fiber, no cholesterol, and is under 1 gram of fat. [2]Veganism is Kinder Towards Animals Con says we were designed to be omnivores since the beginning. It's true that human beings are omnivores, however, we are not obligate omnivores. We can be healthy without eating animal products. They are not necessary for good nutrition. Veganism is Better For The Environment Con asked me how animals produce more greenhouse gases than all of transport. To put it simply, the world's 1.5 billion cows and billions of other grazing animals emit dozens of polluting gases, including lots of methane. [3] Methane is produced by farting and belching cows. So, since we raise huge amounts of animals for food each year, and each of them produces polluting gases, it's not hard to see how they would produce more than transport. In sum, a lot of animals, a lot of polluting gases, equals serious problems for the environment. Conclusion Overall,  I think I have shown how a vegan lifestyle is better than a meat eating one. It's better for the animals, will provide more food for hungry people, and is better for the environment. This would all be true even from the perspective of the individual instead of society. Finally, thank you Con for a enjoyable debate.</t>

    <t>Thanks for the debate, Pro. 1. Nature It seems that Pro is linking animals to slaves. This is not a good comparison, and this is why. Animals are treated with RESPECT. Crazy, right? After all, the big manufacturers treat the animals poorly. Ask any farmer who is not part of a big manufacturer and they would say they care for their animals, even though they are to be killed anyway. Even some farmers who are part of large manufacturers love their animals, and they think they shouldn't be treated like so, some even quit because of this. Animals are still LOVED, they are not viewed as 'mere commodities'. Second, food. Did we need slaves to survive? No, it was just a way to be lazy. Animals can be FOOD, it isn't bad for you and it certainly has nutritional value. We ate it for SURVIVAL, slaves were used just for making things easier, and they weren't treated with respect. Yes, there could be improvements to the current system, but how does this benefit the individual? It doesn't, it doesn't.  2. Nutrition Pro forgets one key aspect. Pro keeps arguing how eating vegetables and fruits is healthy, we need to remember that having a omnivore diet means eating vegetables and fruits too. As I explained in round 4, you get all the nutritional value of fruits and vegetables, and get all the benefits from eating meat as well. Why trouble yourself into trying to find a source of protein and all the nutritional things in meat in a vegan diet, if you could just change to a healthier omnivore diet( (eating more fruits and vegetables)?  3. Veganisim is Better for the environment Do we need electronics to survive? Do we really need online debate sites? Do we need big cities or schools to survive? No, they aren't necessary, but they are EXTREMELY beneficial. We could live without all these things, it's possible, but it's better if we do have them. Same thing goes with meat, we don't need meat, but it is extremely beneficial. Remember, you will still be eating vegetables and fruits, and you will benefit from meat too.  4. Veganisim is better for the environment So, if we let ALL of them free, will that help? At least in farms they get food, and their waste gets cleaned up. Imagine how bad it would be if we let them free. A lot of natural resources would be depleted, there would be overcrowding due to the mass amount of animals., and there will be a lot of gases being thrown into the atmosphere. In fact, there might be even MORE, because there's no one to clean it up. All in all, it would be more disastrous for everyone if we just let all of them free.  Conclusion: I stand firmly on the position that an omnivore diet is better than a vegan one for the individual. You get all the nutrition from fruits and vegetables, AND you get the added bonus from the meat (Not to mention having one of the tastiest parts of the meal). It is just better and more nutritious (that's vague, but that's all I can think of). I believe I have successfully countered my opponents arguments, and that my arguments stay standing.  Thank you for the amazing debate Pro. Thanks to all the voters who vote, and I hope you vote Con.</t>

    <t>Thank you for extending and understanding, Pro  Rebuttals: 1. Defending my clarification When I created this debate, I intended for the debate to focus on the individual. I thought the topic title would speak for itself. Lifestyle relates to an individual's choices in life, or how the state of their life is. What I believe Pro is trying to say is that a vegan community is better than a meat-eating one, which is not what the title is. Therefore, I still stand by my clarification, as it was originally intended for this debate.  2. Nature This was originally intended to be a rebuttal. If it is truly morally wrong to eat animals, give me a reason why it is. I strongly believe that it is NOT morally wrong to eat animals. Our ancestors have been doing it for a long time, and it was necessary for human SURVIVAL back then, and it still is. Pro has not given a reason WHY it's morally wrong to eat animals.  3. Food Chain This was originally intended to be a rebuttal. Have we had any problems eating animals? Any health problems? We have been eating meat for a long time. Tell me Pro, why is it wrong to eat animals? After all, we have been doing it for a long time.  4. Nutrition I will give some reasons why an omnivore diet is nutritional. First, we need to see that an omnivore diet STILL INCLUDES VEGETABLES AND FRUITS. We aren't totally dismissing vegetables and fruits in an omnivore diet, that would be a carnivore. So omnivores will get the nutrition from vegetables and fruits, along with the nutrition of meat. Here are some reasons why meat provides nutritional value. [1] Meat provides vitamin B12, which is a vital vitamin. Studies show that 92% of vegans are severely lacking in this vital nutrients. Pro asks how meat is superior in protein. Meat contains a lot of amino acids, which builds muscle. Studies show that people with omnivore diets have more muscle then vegans. It also increases your bone density at an old age and reduces risk of fractures. WITH the added value form vegetables and fruit, we can see that the omnivore diet is better.  5. Veganisim is kinder toward animals Unlike humans, those are animals. We didn't eat the slaves, we didn't even need them for survival. Our ancestors didn't used slaves, it's something government gave birth to. All of the animals (including us) have basically a couple basic needs. Find FOOD and drink, Sleep, Reproduce. It's just that us humans are a lot more advanced than animals, but we all still share the same basic needs. All animals need to find food, meat or not, and we were designed to be omnivores since the beginning.  6. Veganisim is Better For The Environment. How does it produce more greenhouse gases than airplanes, automobiles, and trains combined? Pro claims that it produces more greenhouse gases, but how? How does it? Pro does not explain this argument well. All that pasture land would probably be used as farms, which as we know, without proper farming techniques, the land will be derived from it's nutrients and it will unable to yield crop, which results in more forest land being cut down for farms.</t>

When we see a weather forecast, you are right that they are not 100% right, but there is a good reason for that. When you have to forecast the weather, you look at the different pressures in the different areas and thereby predicting e.g. a storms movement a behaviour. So when you see a weather forecast, it is 100% right if nothing in the pressure changed since it was made.  Climate change and weather forecast are scientifically proved.

    <t>Sorry for late delivery of this argument: I flew to New York to visit family during Christmas.  To correct my opponents reasoning, 'humans' advanced thinking does not benefit the common good.' Whether humans' ability to think clearly and rationally is objectively great, there is no 'common good' when it comes to inter-species contact. If you have ever watched the PBS program 'Nature', you know that it is usually a zero-sum game when it comes to survival. Our skills are good for US and that is what matters. My opponent also said, 'the Earth will crumble to global warming in a couple decades', which is completely null and void because global warming is a natural phenomenon that has been occurring since the end of the last ice age 14,000 years ago. I will not debate whether global warming is a real threat (or as real as eco-freaks make it out to be), nor if it is humans' fault- that is not the purpose of this debate (however, for the record, human beings are innocent in the climate change theory). My opponent then went further, 'we single handedly destroyed billions of years of progress to produce life forms as they are today'. Now, the term 'progress' was used very, very loosely here. Progress as in 'the evolution and random turn of events that resulted in the current state of things'? If that is what you mean, then what 'we' have done is merely played our part in evolution- the weak are trampled and the strong go on to victory. It may seem wrong to justify it like that but be REALISTIC, human beings are a species like all others that is fighting against all odds for survival, we just happened to be WINNING, sorry about that.  Environmentalists and the irrationalists like them enjoy weighing the benefit of one INDIVIDUAL thing against the burden of the entire COLLECTIVE thing (as in, 'is the iPhone 6 really better than the commonwealth of everything?'). This can get annoying to rational people, so allow me to turn the tables. Is the entire production of everything that supports BILLIONS of people all over the world that has lasted throughout human history and has benefited countless people just like your self better than preserving a certain sub-species of cheetahs?  Also, my opponent said that 'in a couple million years, we've destroyed this planet' as a rebuttal to my statement that 'we own this planet'. I was speaking metaphorically, as in our immense power over the planet, and my opponent took this literally and came up with an even DUMBER statement: 'we've destroyed the planet'. Really? We've destroyed it? Because when I look around, I see people shopping at supermarkets and living in heated, lighted homes and working with easy tasks instead of hunting for buffalo. I see barren land (objectively, of course) being transformed into neighborhoods that help families and individuals live lives that the kings of 500 years ago (before mass pollution) could never dream of.  Then my opponent said something so hypocritical, and really gave his debate away: 'Many humans do live on the brink of starvation, fighting predators to survive another day'. My opponent advocates environmentalism, which supports only those who live in such a way; you outlined a global tragedy that can only be solved by human beings who do NOT support environmentalism. When mining and manufacturing companies move into impoverished villages, they pay off the landowners and villagers and often build houses worth much more in order to give the villagers a place to live. Environmentalists constantly try to stop this with lawsuits. By your logic, all people should live like that.  You said that humans invented war. In a strong sense of the word, yes, you are correct. Yet, does this not stem from a purpose? Ideas. People have ideas, sometimes political or religious. These ideas have gotten us very far, indeed. Sometimes, however, people have conflicting ideas and one of them wants to force his ideas on the other. This results in a war. You have proven yourself wrong, by admitting that humans are the only species that have ideas to fight about.  Most bad things that have been done by humans (such as genocide) have been done by irrationalists (like yourself). Collectivism, communism, subjectivism, environmentalism, nationalism, racism, are all things that cause wars and devalue man. All of these things fall under the category of irrationalism, they are forms of philosophy that the Nazis follow.  The bad deeds of a few should not reflect poorly on the good done by everyone else. However, you are a collectivist and believe that humans, plants, animals, sand, and communists are all the same in terms of rights. There is no debating here.</t>

    <t>I would first like to thank my opponent for bringing up this debate. This is a very interesting topic.  First off I will refute my opponent's points and then present my own.  My opponent has said that Earth has thrown so much at the human race and we have survived. Well, obviously, tons of other species have too. Humans have been on Earth a fraction of the time so many other species have. He also said that we have the power of rational thinking and advancement. But the question here is: Are the human's advancements actually good to the common good? No, actually, if you look at the facts a lot of them aren't. The human race may only have another couple decades or so until the Earth crumbles to global warming. [1] Is it good that we single handedly DESTROYED billions of years of progress to produce life forms as they are today? Is the iPhone 6 really better than the commonwealth of everything on Earth? My opponent was even arrogant enough to say that we own this planet. Like I said earlier, we've only been around a couple million years and using that time, we've destroyed this planet. He said that it doesn't matter that dolphins have higher thinking skills because they haven't been able to build houses. News flash: Dolphins are underwater. They don't actually need to build houses. He finally said that 'we do not live on the brink of starvation, fighting predators to survive just another day.' Well, look at the news, my friend. Many humans do. 'We invent, capitalize, work and trade as much as we can.' Many other species are actually very advanced. Take the komodo dragon. They hunt their prey in such an advanced way, they have an animal lying around to munch on for months. They chase after it for a little bit, bite it, and then simply wait. Their saliva contains more than 50 different types of bacteria. [2] You do NOT want to get that stuff into your bloodstream. After so little, they come home with a massive hunk of meat that, like I said earlier, covers their food needs for months.  Now I would like to present my arguments:  1-Humans don't know when to stop: Like I said earlier, humans have pretty much screwed everything up. Even though humans created new stuff we DON'T KNOW WHEN TO STOP! All these other species have survived and thrived for twice or three times the time we have. Yet, they haven't destroyed the Earth in every possible way. Additionally, we didn't even realize what was going on until the 1970s. [3]  2-Humans are the most death-obsessed race: True, life is not all butterflies and rainbows. But humans have taken this to the next level. We have definitely invented one thing: war. Have you ever heard of a war between two groups of animals? Of course not. That's because they are not as obsessed with death and destruction as the human race. In fact, no animal has ever killed another animal of its own species for reasons other than cannibalism on purpose. Additionally, no other species constructs such elaborate ways to create mass genocide. I did mention the advanced tactics of the Komodo dragon earlier, but does this compare to the myriad of work done on creating nuclear missiles, or mastering the idea of radioactivity so that we can use it to destroy a city?</t>

    <t>My opponent started off by refuting my point that humans' advanced thinking does not benefit the common good. However, this argument still stands. According to him, if we are doing good for the short term life of our country, we are doing good for the world. This is the kind of thinking that humans use that HAS destroyed the world. If he will 'not debate whether global warming is a real threat,' then I will first put in a last reason to prove climate change is a real issue, and then provide another example. Global warming may have been going on since the dawn of time, but (I am not going to provide a source for this one, if you oppose it then you need to be educated,) we have been greatly helping this along through the mass releases of carbon in every little activity that we do. Take my next example, extinction. Here we have yet another example of the 'Great Expansion' of the human race. According to my opponent we are winning in the fight for survival, but to defend my point that we are the creators of war, (which my opponent supports, as I will later prove,) humans have taken this 'fight' way too far. Do other species kill other tons of their own species to prove an idea? No! His refutation to this point was very weak. Its only purpose was to advocate war. He implied evolution was not progress, but completely missed the point. He asked if 'the entire production of everything that supports BILLIONS of people all over the world that has lasted throughout human history and has benefited countless people just like your self better than preserving a certain sub-species of cheetahs?' but we can have a common ground here. Mass production of things we don't need stands in the way of preservation, but we don't have to become animals to help them. Do we need the iPhone 6, or the countless things a needless as it? No. But ignoring other beings because they are not vital to our own survival is different. You feel compassion for a dying animal on the side of the road, but not a broken phone. Then he went on to rant and call me a genocidal Nazi communist. He said that 'most bad things that have been done by humans have been done by irrationalists.' Well, yes, but he only proved me right here. The human race has so many problems and so do other species. We are equal. True, not everything is equal, but a criminal is not better than a cat, is it? A cat may not have ever done anything bad, but a criminal sure has. That's why he's a criminal. The cat is better than the criminal.  I will go out of this round providing some extra reasons to vote for my side. First, humans are the only mammal incapable of making their own vitamin C, which actually caused Ebola in Africa. Ebola circled around animals such as monkeys in Africa for a long time without harming them, but a human got it and started this whole Ebola epidemic. Finally, humans are animals too. We belong to the Animalia Kingdom.  I have indisputably won this debate.</t>

    <t>Clarification: This debate is on the basis of whether or not humans are better than animals in respect to development and utilization of the environment, i.e. the mastering of life.  Humans are a species that has adapted to their environment very well in the last 100,000 years. This means that as much as nature has thrown at us during ice ages, floods, famine, disease, heat, cold, and all other kinds of disasters, humans have come out on top every time. We have evolved to be much more intelligent in respect to language, conceptual thinking, perceptual thinking, insight, and mathematics. Rational thinking is strictly human, all other animals have varying levels of instinct and lower levels of perception. Even gorillas, whose brain patterns and development is close to humans, have not been able to construct most anything. Gorillas have not linked their logical side to their instinctual side, thus any similarity to humans is unpractical.  All other animals are even lower in development and utilization of the environment than humans. Both objectively and subjectively, humans own this planet. The term 'best' can be defined by the most utilized, practical talents among the creatures of the animal kingdom. For example, it doesn't matter in the slightest that dolphins are able to communicate well, because, in this moment in time they have failed to construct walls, housing, tools, or any other useful piece. This is why 'man-made' is a term used for pretty much anything that is 'made' by a living organism. Of course, ants, termites, and bees are close to humans in their social skills and developmental skills and thus could be said to be closer to humans than apes. However, our immense size (relative to smart insects) enables us to construct irrigation systems, mining and drilling operations, controlled fire, and most importantly, agriculture. These examples of utilization of the environment are absolutely impossible for creatures of insect size. Thus, the most important things in human life are strictly human.  The breaking free of 'need' is an achievement of humanity. As humans, we do not live on the brink of starvation, fighting predators to survive just another day. We are more profoundly adapt to our environment than other animals. With such ancient inventions as knives, wheels, clothing, fire, farming, and buildings, we are able to set aside the limited time in the day for 'play'. However, as smart beings, we use this extra time to reinvest in our welfare. We invent, capitalize, work, and trade as much as we can. With higher and higher returns in the standard of living, human beings have lifted from the mud and are the sole creature to have reached the stars.</t>

    <t>David Graber, an environmentalist at the National Parks Dept. once said, 'Until human beings can rejoin nature, we can only hope for the right virus to come along..'. That is a little unnerving, however it is the basic consensus of the leaders of the environmental movement. My opponent implies that humans are not apart of nature, only a force against it. This means that you and I, if he is right, must be a plague upon the earth, and that we must be wiped out.  I know for sure that my opponent will next ride over that statement, saying that it is 'foolish' and 'absurd'. All environmentalists do. However, I ask you this: if my opponent considers building a farm a form of net destruction (as he stated), he must consider trees and 'the millions of different life forms inside them' vastly more important than human beings like you and me.  This kind of thinking- that humans are equal to all life forms- engenders questions of the limits of 'rights'. In other words, does the ebola virus have the same right to exist as a human being? Obviously, common sense would dictate not. But, if you follow my opponent's reason to it's logical conclusion, a human has no right to murder a virus! This kind of nonsense is what happens if you take environmentalism too far; but honestly, name something in history that wasn't taken too far. This line of thinking is evil, it implies that we are not more evolved than the lower animals, ad thus have no right to act as a dominant species.  My opponent keeps bringing up guns, murder, genocide, and war. Obviously, he is preoccupied with the bad parts of human life (as if the possession of reason has proved to be a net loss). If you consider how he points to the evils done by a few men, and blames them on the entire species, you can tell he has no chance of being correct in his argument. He skipped over my point that 'the iPhone 6 is not a main source of pollution', clearly to avoid questioning our need for energy and food and shelter and paper and all other things we use everyday. If my opponent questioned our need for those most essential things, he would most definitely lose this lose this debate. Of course, the fifth amendment does protect you from admitting self-incriminating evidence!</t>

    <t>My opponent clearly doesn't understand what the term 'destroyed' refers to when he uses it. In the context 'humans have destroyed the world' he overlooks that in this situation there is a beneficiary. Therefore, it depends on the perspective. If I cut down 100 trees in order to build a farm that feeds a small town, is it destruction? This is the question that my opponent cannot ask.  When I said that I will not debate global warming, I meant right here, right now. In a separate debate, I would debate that. I do not 'support' war, but I (unlike my opponent) understand that it is the bad side of something inherently good, ideas. My opponent also keeps bringing up the iPhone 6, as if that is a major source of environmental pollution. Maybe you should ask, 'do we need electricity?' not 'do we need the iPhone 6?'. I realize that humans ARE apart of the animal kingdom, this debate's topic (as I specified) is whether humans are the BEST in the animal kingdom.  Obviously, my opponent sees human beings as the sole source of win-lose environmental change; this would mean that other species do not run each other 'out of business'. I am clearly the rationalist in this debate.</t>

If genocide such as this is required to do something as simple as build a farm, then yes. It is destruction. I am using the iPhone 6 as one of countless examples of needless products mass produced for no reason. He said that other species do run each other 'out of business,' but he didn't really help his side. He just made a vague metaphor that I believe meant that other species kill each other too.

    <t>My opponent started with a quote from an environmentalist basically saying that humans have to be wiped out. This is a very extreme measure of what I am trying to say. My opponent has earlier said, 'the bad deeds of a few should not reflect poorly on the good done by everyone else,' which proves my point and makes the quote entirely null and void. He said I 'must consider trees and 'the millions of different life forms inside them' vastly more important than human beings like you and me,' but he is merely and desperately trying to incriminate me. Millions, if not billions of organisms, in my opponent's thinking are nothing compared to, in the scenario he described, at most 100 people. This is the sort of idea that sparks one of humans's creations: genocide. Then he began going very extremely into this ideal, but viruses such as Ebola are not actually organisms, and therefore cannot feel. 'Murdering' Ebola would have the same effect on Ebola as kicking a rock would on the rock. Can the rock feel? No, and neither can viruses and the other examples my opponent was implying. Then he went on to call me evil. He, all throughout this debate, has been attacking me personally, calling me a evil genocidal Nazi communist. This only proves he has realized that I have already won this debate, and is just angry with me. I am, in his opinion, 'preoccupied with the bad parts of human life.' Well, as I have proven, most of the 'advances' of the human race have resulted in problems for the last couple hundred years. I didn't skip over his point that 'the iPhone 6 is not a main source of pollution,' I proved it was wrong. I have been using the iPhone 6 as an EXAMPLE, not the sole reason against humanity. In the above round, I talk more about this, so I did respond to his point. 'Mass production of things we don't need stands in the way of preservation, but we don't have to become animals to help them. Do we need the iPhone 6, or the countless things a needless as it? No. But ignoring other beings because they are not vital to our own survival is different. You feel compassion for a dying animal on the side of the road, but not a broken phone,' to quote myself. In the final debate, I will provide again my two main arguments used in the first round:  1-Humans don't know when to stop: My opponent has mainly focused on this argument, but still has not proven it wrong. As you will see if you scroll through this page, humans have, yes, destroyed the Earth. My opponent 'refuses to debate global warming,' but that's OK, because there are so many other examples I've shown throughout this debate: extinction, deforestation, and so on.  2-Humans are the most death-obsessed race: My opponent mentioned this once to partially agree with it. He used a weak refutation that war was about ideas, but there are other ways to prove an idea, and if you can kill more people than the other guy, that doesn't mean you're right. No other species has killed another of its own species purposefully for reasons other than cannibalism.  Now, a couple more reasons I have provided throughout: Humans are the only mammal incapable of making their own vitamin C, the cat vs. criminal example (a criminal is not better than a cat, is it? A cat may not have ever done anything bad, but a criminal sure has. That's why he's a criminal. The cat is better than the criminal), and weighing on scope (more animals than humans).  My opponent has failed to refute any of my points while I have effectively refuted all of his. I have obviously and indisputably won this debate.</t>

    <t>The sun drives of climate change The main driver of modern climate is solar activity. The energy output of the sun, called the irradiance. has been nearly constant in modern times, so that's not the cause. It is primarily the magnetic field of the sun which drives climate, and to a lesser extent the ultraviolet component of the irradiance. The magnet component varies dramatically. Norwegian scientists in the 1990's discovered that the single measure of solar activity that best predicts climate is the length of the previous solar cycle. “The most readily apparent cycle in solar activity is the cycle in sunspot activity. These solar cycles average eleven years in length, and they have ranged in length from nine years to beyond eighteen years.“ [1] The length of the solar predicts climate change as shown in the graph [2] below:The increase in CO2 is very close to exponential, so as Pro noted, AGW theory predicts a straight line temperature rise. The graph shows clearly that is not what has happened. Climate has been behaving according to solar activity. “A paper published [in 2012] in the Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physicsfinds that up to 72% of the temperature increase over the last 150 years can be explained by the length of solar cycles,” [3] The length of the solar cycle does not perfectly represent the sun effects, so it's likely that a more precise model would produce a more precise result.  Cosmic rays affect cloud cover  The physical theory that explains the correlation is summarized by Archibald: There are two main ways that changing solar activity affects terrestrial climate. Both have their origin in the strength of the Sun’s magnetic field. In the first route, a lower magnetic field strength results in less sunspot activity, which in turn mean less solar wind, which allows more galactic cosmic rays to get to Earth’s orbit. The neutron shower from galactic cosmic rays causes more cloud formation, which in turn reflects more sunlight back into space, making the Earth colder. … In the second route, the lower magnetic field strength results in a lower temperature of the Sun’s chromosphere, which in turn produces less ultraviolet light. That decreases the production of lower stratospheric ozone, and that decrease causes a negative North Atlantic Oscillation (a fluctuation in sea-level atmospheric pressure), making the Northern Hemisphere colder. This second route makes winters longer and colder without necessarily reducing peak summer temperatures. [4] If solar magnetic activity really changes cloud cover, the incident radiance on the earth should vary with the sun's magnetic activity. That has been observed just as the solar theory predicts. [5] Solar activity is measured historically by the formation of beryllium 10, which accumulates in sediments to provide a history of solar activity. “The Modern Warm Period from 1900 to 2008 is associated with a large decline in Be10 in ice cores, indicating a sustained higher level of solar activity in the twentieth century. There is also very close correlation between ice-rafted stone debris in the North Atlantic and Be10 levels over the last 10,000 years—another demonstration that solar activity controls climate.” [6] The correlation continues through to the present day. Solar activity predicts the 17+ year halt in global warming as the cycle has reached a flat peak and is starting downward. The pause in global warming is illustrated in this graph: [7]:The AGW computer models include irradiance, which is essentially constant, but the models take no account at all of the solar magnetic effects that correlate tightly with climate. AGW theorists now admit that the CO2 models cannot be tweaked to explain the pause. They are now proposing a variety of new theories to patch the failed old theory. [8] One theory is that for some reason all the warming is going into the deep oceans. Another theory is that atmospheric aerosols (i.e., soot) is reducing the size of rain drops causing clouds to be whiter and reflect more energy. There are other theories. The problem is that if there is any uncalculated factor that completely wipes out CO2 effects, that admits CO2 does not dominate climate. If uncalculated factors can be as large or larger than the CO2 effect, that admits that previous warming might have been the result of unknown factors as well. The premise of the AGW theory was that because all the other factors affecting climate were known, CO2 must have caused the warming from 1983 to 1996.  Historically, solar activity drives climate with CO2 rising after there is warmingAl Gore famously showed two graphs, one of temperature over time and one of CO2 over time. The shapes of the curves were similar, showing a high correlation. Mr. Gore never overlaid the graphs. Had he done so, it would have been apparent that CO2 levels were following the warming rather by hundreds of years rather than leading it. As the oceans warm, they can dissolve less CO2, which is then released into the atmosphere. The CO2 rise is in response to the solar magnetic effects that changed cloud cover to cause the basic climate change.Over long periods of earth's history, there is no relationship between CO2 and climate.[8]Consensus does not determine sciencePro has the burden of proving that human activity has dominated climate. My burden is only to show that the anthropogenic theory is unproved. A scientific theory is wrong if it fails to explain or predict, and anthropogenic theory has clearly failed. I'm not obligated to prove an alternative theory, but I nonetheless shown that solar magnetic activity explains and predicts climate much better than CO2 theory. Since solar magnetic activity has dominated climate, anthropogenic causes cannot be dominant. AGW theorists admit that factors not in their computer models have been so large as to completely cancel greenhouse gas effects. for the past 17+ years.Pro stresses that it is not just that a consensus exists, but that the consensus is based on data. (Actually, the only real data is a general increase in temperature which solar theory better explains, and the rest is computer models that did not predict the hiatus.) But every scientific consensus has been supported by data that scientists at the time thought conclusive. A wrong consensus means that the data was incorrect or that it was incorrectly interpreted. The once near-unanimous consensus that the earth was the center of the universe was based upon the indisputable observation that the sky appears to rotate around the earth. The theory was found wrong only by more careful observations starting with the inconsistent behavior of the paths of planets in the sky. In the 1960s, the scientific consensus favored the Steady State Theory over the Big Bang Theory. The Big Bang Theory predicted the presence of microwave background radiation, so when the background radiation was discovered, the consensus changed rapidly. Not long ago, the learned scientific consensus was that homosexuality was a form of mental illness. Psychologists thought they had the data to prove it, but they were wrong; it is genetic. Modern scientists continue to make errors reflected in wrong consensus. A very strong scientific consensus has until the past few years supported the theory that in the human diet, saturated fat causes high serum cholesterol levels which in turn causes heart disease. It turns out the original theory was based upon falsified data. The landmark peer that 'proved' the theory deliberately excluded data that falsified the theory. A couple of other bogus papers supported the theory, including one in which cholesterol was injected into vegetarian rabbits, who then quite predictably died. Studies over the past fifty years that attempted to confirm the theory instead disproved it. [9, 10] The originator of the cholesterol theory believed it, and he did a great job of selling the theory so it quickly reached consensus.. Many papers giving the “wrong” results were not allowed to be published, or the authors declined to submit them for fear of ruining their reputation. Some scientists published after they retired so that career retribution could not be inflicted. I recite the cholesterol consensus error because it's very close to the way anthropogenic global warming theory has achieved consensus. Early enthusiastic advocates sold the theory as the only possible explanation of the rapid rise of temperatures from 1983 to 1996. According to that data, not only was CO2 the cause, but climate sensitivity much have been very large, perhaps five or even ten. Now Pro's claim is that it is at least 0.7. If it is that low, then global warming is not a crisis. it's hardly worth noting. The bogus 97% consensus comes from surveying only journals that refuse to publish dissent. The Climategate scandal showed how eager AGW are to suppress dissent.'In a November 15, 2005, email Mann expresses his satisfaction that Geophysical Research Letters is now firmly under the control of the climate change alarmists but laments that other publications still publish research by skeptics: “The Geophysical Research Letters leak may have been plugged up now with new editorial leadership there, but these guys always have Climate Research and Energy and Environment, and will go there if necessary.” [9]Very few papers scientific papers say anything about global warming as whole. For example, there are about 200 papers that show that the Medieval Warm Period and similar climate change existed worldwide, and that refute the bogus Hockey Stick argument for AGW. But the papers would not be counted as being in opposition to AGW. Besides, they are in the wrong journals. Virtually all the papers on solar theory -- there are hundreds -- are in specialist journals, not the surveyed climate journals.Per the terms of of the debate, I'll put the reference list in the debate comments.</t>

    <t>== Rebuttals ==    R1) Solar cycle as a driver of climate   It is good that Roy discards the idea that TSI can explain the modern temperature increase. Even skeptical climatologists are beginning to accept this, they note TSI can explain “virtually none” of the warming past 1950 [1].  Roy begins by citing a 1991 study by Friis-Christensen et al (his graph). The study purported to claim the solar cycle length correlated with temperatures. It must be noted Christensen’s temperature data ended in 1985, which ignores a huge portion of the warming which occurred in the 1990s.  Christensen’s study was criticized for mathematical errors. A new paper has come out and corrected the errors from the original paper. The result was solar cycle length did not correlate well with temperature. Solar cycle length did correlate with temperatures until 1985—when the dataset for Friss-Christensen et al. ended—but after 1985, the correlation broke apart. Solar cycle length fell as temperatures began to dramatically increase. The correlation Roy uses in his graph has since been falsified [2]. The following graph shows the updated correlation:          The mathematical errors are shown by this graph [3]:            As can be seen, Roy’s source is flawed and newer measurements prove that solar cycle lengths cannot explain the modern warming.    Roy then cites a paper purportedly claiming 72% of the earth’s increase in temperature is due to the solar cycle. Roy cites a skeptical blog, and the blog exaggerated the findings. 72% of the temperature change in the North Atlantic can be explained by solar fluctuations, according to the study—not global temperatures. If you go to the actual source it says “[w]e find for the Norwegian local stations investigated that 25–56% of the temperature increase the last 150 years may be attributed to the Sun” [emphasis added] [4]. You can see the study is looking into local stations, not global phenomena! Roy’s 72% number is an exaggeration and is in relation to one region, not the entire globe.   Evidence shows global temperatures do NOT correlate with solar cycle lengths, and much of the evidence Roy uses relies upon local Norwegian data. Not global data. Therefore, Roy fails to prove that the sun correlates well with global temperature.     R2) Cosmic rays and climate   For cosmic rays to explain climate change, all of the following must be true: 1) the solar magnetic field must have a long-term negative trend, 2) the cosmic ray flux must have a long-term negative trend, 3) cosmic rays must create low level clouds, 4) low level clouds must have a long term negative trend [5].   The solar magnetic field actually has not changed much over the last 30 years. The correlation between temperature and cosmic rays is fairly weak. Even assuming that the correlation exists, it is about equal to the anti-correlation of TSI (which has been falling, and leading to cooling). Cosmic rays have had little overall impact on temperatures over the last few decades [6].   Have cosmic rays had a long-term negative trend? No. Cosmic rays have had no discernable trend from 1951 to 2006, and have stayed relatively stable [5]. Further, the GCR (galactic cosmic ray) flux only correlated with temperature between 1970 and 1985, and even then it lagged temperature. The correlation totally breaks down in the 1990s. The changes in the GCR flux cannot be the cause of more than 15% of the observed temperature increase [7]. In fact, some research has found the GCR flux is increasing. SkepticalScience, quoting Erlykin et al. 2013, notes “[r]ecent measurements of the cosmic ray intensity show that a former decrease with time has been reversed. Thus, even if cosmic rays enhanced cloud production, there would be a small global cooling, not warming” (emphasis original) [5]. If GCR’s have been causing a net-cooling, they cannot explain the warming trend.   Do GCR’s cause low-level cloud cover? No. The correlation between GCR’s and cloud cover begins to disintegrate in 1989. By 1994, the correlation completely breaks apart, and there is no way that we can see changes in the GCR flux affecting low-level clouds, as can be seen in the graph [8].         Cosmic rays are red, versus low cloud cover (blue). We see little correlation between the two.   Do low-level clouds have a negative effect on temperature? There is conflicting evidence here [5]. Regardless, GCR’s don’t seem to change cloud cover or correlate well with temperature.   R3) The ‘pause’   Roy claims surface temperature has shown no trend recently. He is using RSS data. UAH data finds an increase of temperature over the same period [9].   Over such a short time period, it is impossible to get statistically significant results. So in order to reduce data uncertainty, I will change the data to 1970 – present. With this, we will always see a warming trend. However, if this ‘pause’ is significant, we should see a large change in trends. Using HADCRUT4 data, from 1970 – 1996 (‘pause’ began in 1996) we get .153 C/decade with a margin of error of 0.067. Then to see if the ‘pause’ significantly reduces this trend, I now extend the data from 1970 – 2014. What do I get? 0.165 degrees C per decade with a margin of error 0.030 [9]. We see no decrease in the overall trend, which would occur if the ‘pause’ were significant. And this method reduces data-uncertainty. So we see there is no statistically significant slowdown of the warming trend in HADCRUT4 data.   The long-term trend of increasing temperatures is due to CO2. Short-term variability happens all the time; it does not mean that the long-term increase is going to stabilize forever. La Nina events have decreased surface warming. La Nina is an oscillation, it is not a long-term phenomena, and will revert to a positive trend eventually. Many models that account for these oscillations do reproduce the ‘pause’. When these factors are accounted for, greenhouse warming still continues to exist [10]. The assertion that models cannot account for the pause is simply incorrect.   The oceans increased heat content, aerosol cooling, La Nina events, etc. all lead to cooling. The fact that any warming has happened at all (see my UAH amp; HADCRUT4 analysis) is supportive of idea that CO2 is a strong climate driver.   R4) Paleoclimate   Roy begins by claiming CO2 lags temperature. Although he cites no source (or at least, not in that paragraph) I know where he got the claim. I cited the exact paper with that claim last round! It claimed there was an 800 year lag between past climate changes and CO2 concentrations. What skeptics don't tell us—and what the paper actually said—is CO2 still acted as an amplifier to other climate changes (a positive feedback for the orbital forcing of the interglacial cycle). CO2 preceded northern hemispheric deglaciation. If you actually read the papers, which claim there to be a lag, they almost all note how CO2 acts as an amplifier and how the results do not contradict AGW. There is new research (Shakun et al.), which argued that CO2 preceded the end of the last ice age, and may have (in part) led to the warm interglacial in which we live today [11]. The following graph from the study demonstrates how CO2 may have been an important factor in the most recent deglaciation:         Blue = temperature, Red (and yellow) = CO2 concentrations.   The recent Shakun study demonstrates how CO2 may have, in part, ended the last ice age.     Roy goes on to claim there is no correlation between CO2 and past temperatures. I followed his sources. The first one was temperature data and made no comments on correlation. Berner 2001 is the other source. I cited this exact study last round. I pulled a direct quote out of the study. I will reiterate it here, “over the long term there is indeed a correlation between CO2 and paleotemperature” [R2]. Using Roy’s sources, we see that CO2 does correlate with temperatures.   Roy’s graph is also a oversimplification. It fails to mention that there ARE other forcings in climate. The other major forcing, the sun, does not correlate well with phanerzoic temperatures either. When the two are put together, there is a strong correlation [12]. The sun alone cannot account for temperatures, and CO2 alone cannot account for the temperatures. When put together, they do. This indicates that CO2 is a very important factor in determining climate. The following graph from the paper depicts the correlation when CO2 and the sun are put together:      R5) Consensus   I agree with Roy that consensus does not tell us whether or not science is correct. The consensus is not what makes the science clear. But there is a consensus because the science is clear. And Roy claims his data supports solar theory. However, I have adequately dismantled that argument using peer-reviewed research and Roy’s own sources.   Roy attempts to claim I have the BOP. This is incorrect. A review of the rules in round one tells us, (rule 5) the BOP is split evenly. Therefore, Roy has an equally important role in disproving AGW as I do in proving it.   Roy shows examples of the consensus failing. This can occur, but citing a few high profile cases back when science was less rigorous is not very compelling. Modern science requires empirical evidence for scientific claims. And as most experts believe in AGW, chances are, strong empirical evidence corroborates the theory.   Roy makes a claim about catastrophic warming. This is not what we are debating, it is irrelevant.    Roy claims climategate shows how scientists ‘suppress’ the science. A reading through the emails, in context, really shows no malice was intended [13]. Multiple independent panels have reviewed the emails, and concluded that no scientific malpractice was committed [14].   Conclusion   The sun is not the cause of the recent warming trend. Paleoclimate continues to give credence to the idea that increased CO2 levels warm the climate. Man is the main driver of modern global warming.</t>

    <t>I thank Roy for accepting this debate. He is one of the best debaters on the site and is very knowledgeable on this subject. It is a pleasure to debate him. ==There exists a scientific consensus== Before I continue, I would like to note this argument in and of itself does not prove that global warming is caused by man. Actual evidence should be the driving force behind this debate. The reason I chose to put this in my argument is simple: the science is not clear because of consensus, but a consensus exists because the evidence is clear. This evidence will be discussed later. A study published in Science reviewed the ISI web of science in order to take a survey of relevant climate literature as to what the causes of climate change are. The study failed to find a single paper which was in opposition to the consensus position, that the main driver of climate change is anthropogenic. 75% of the papers supported the consensus position, whereas 25% had no position (they were focused on things other than forgings, like impacts or paleoclimate) [1]. The study also noted how many organizations have come out supporting the idea of anthropogenic climate change. The IPCC, the American Meteorological Society, American Geophysical Union, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science have all concluded that the evidence for AGW is overwhelming [2]. NASA furthers this argument, noting “most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position”. They also argue “[n]inety-seven percent of climate scientists agree that climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities” [3]. A 196 page report representing 13 governmental agencies, and written by 28 authors from scientific institutions, has stated “[t]he global warming of the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced increases in heat-trapping gases” [4]. ==Climate sensitivity== As Roy is well aware, this is the key point in all of climate science (we have discussed this before in a PM). For those who are unaware, climate sensitivity is defined as how much warming is produced by a doubling of CO2. Both skeptics and AGW supporters agree that the direct effect of doubling CO2 is one degree C, the debate is over feedbacks [5]. First, what is a feedback? Climate skeptic Roy Spencer explains it fairly simply. He describes a forcing as how much temperature change occurs. A feedback determines how large the change in temperatures will be. Feedbacks refer to how clouds and other warming/cooling mechanisms change in response to a forcing (i.e. CO2, TSI, CRs). He also explains positive and negative feedbacks. Take a car, for example. The temperature forcing would be the sun beating down on the car. Opening the window slowly would cool the car, over time, and be a negative feedback. On the other hand, if you were to close the window, the car would warm (due to an enhanced greenhouse effect), which would be a positive feedback [6]. So the question is whether or not the climate is dominated by negative or positive feedbacks. There is even the possibility of there being no feedbacks, as the positive and negatives could cancel each other out. Research by climate skeptics published in Climate Research has demonstrated that climate sensitivity, based on model means, is 1.9 degrees C. Using differing methods of empirical approaches, they conclude that climate sensitivity is 1 – 1.6 degrees C [7]. Although these estimates shy towards having no net-amplifier, the no-amplification scenario still supports a strong influence of man on climate. In fact, to put an answer numerically, about 50% of the warming would be caused by man if there was no net-feedback [8]. Assuming no amplifier, research has found that “the largest contribution to the 20th century warming comes from anthropogenic sources” [9]. They find that of the ~0.7 degree C temperature rise in the 20th century (some estimates slightly higher), about 0.4 degrees of that are due to anthropogenic forgings, or about 57% of the warming (personal calculation from these skeptical studies and personal correspondence with their authors). A significant body of research notes that climate sensitivity is likely much higher. A review of the evidence in 2008 finds that mean climate sensitivity is 3 degrees C, with a range of 2 – 4.5 degrees C. Based on multiple lines of evidence, we see *almost* every which way to measure climate sensitivity leads to approximately the same result: a doubling of CO2 will lead to 3 degrees C of temperature rise [10]. The following graphic from the study corroborates this:   The gray is the range (2 – 4.5 degrees C), the line in the center is on 3 degrees C, and the circles in the lines are the ‘very likely’ ranges. Most of them rest on the 3 degree mark, with some under and some above. Therefore, we can conclude that from these lines of evidence, mean sensitivity is about 3 degrees C. Another study replicates the above conclusions. The upper limit for climate sensitivity is around 4 degrees C, and certainly below 6 degrees C. Using a Bayesian statistical approach, which is “the dominant [method] in the literature”, these findings support the notion of climate sensitivity as maximum 4 degrees C, a mean of 3 degrees C, and likely not lower than 3 degrees [11]. The following graph [12] again details the results of many different studies. The best estimates generally center around 2.5 – 3 degrees C.   Some evidence published in 2012 claims sensitivity is on the low end of the spectrum, however, still note that “[h]umanity is . . . responsible for the most recent period of warming from 1976 to 2010” [13]. The fact is, climate sensitivity is high and the climate system is predominated by positive feedback mechanisms. Whether it be due to changes in clouds, increased water vapor, or long-term albedo changes. With a climate sensitivity of 1 (no positive or negative forcings), anthropogenic CO2 still causes up to 50% of the warming. With a climate sensitivity of 3 degrees C, humanity is the main driver of climate from about 1976 through present (see, e.g., [13]). ==Paleoclimate== There is significant evidence from paleoclimate records that CO2 can have an effect on changes in the climate. Climate skeptic and paleoclimatologist Bob Carter emphasizes the importance of paleoclimate data. He compares climate to a piece of string. The current instrumental data (1850 – present) is a very short period of time, according to Carter. And when the ‘string’ is lengthened, we see a lot of climactic variability. Instead of looking at the recent past, we should look at the entire temperature record in order to get an accurate picture of the climate [14]. I will provide evidenc, contrary to what Carter believes, lengthening the string supports AGW theory. Over the Cenozoic Era, which began 66 million years ago, we see clear warming and cooling cycles caused by changes in CO2 concentrations. The sun increased slightly over that time period, whereas temperatures cooled. CO2, however, fell steadily through that time period. Plate tectonics was also accounted for. With natural forcings an unlikely cause, “CO2 was the dominant climate forcing in the Cenozoic” [15]. When you lengthen the ‘string’ over the course of the entire Phanerozoic (500 million years; begins at the Cambrian) there is still evidence of CO2 driving multiple climate changes. The GEOCARB study, published in 2001, is one of the definitive proxy records for CO2 concentrations within the last 500 million years. The study notes that “over the long term there is indeed a correlation between CO2 and paleotemperature” [16]. Evidence from the Vostok ice cores (specifically 240,000 before present), proves that CO2 has had an effect on temperatures. Although the initial forcing was orbital changes in the sun, CO2 “plays . . . a key role in amplifying the initial orbital forcing” and “the CO2 increase clearly precedes the Northern Hemi sphere deglaciation”. The study also notes that these forcings “are also at work for the present-day and future climate” [17]. There is also proof that it is warmer now than it has been since the MWP. In fact, it is warmer now than any year since 1400 AD [18]. Newer reconstructions continue to support this finding, and even extends the dataset. It finds that the Roman warm period (RWP) and the MWP as much cooler than today, and claims to have replicated previous ‘hockey stick’ studies [19]. The results are depicted below.   Looking into the geologic past, we see strong evidence in favor of the idea that carbon dioxide can increase temperature. It logically follows that if humans continue to emit CO2, and other greenhouse gasses, that human emissions will increase temperatures. Conclusion: It is clear as to *why* a scientific consensus exists. There is overwhelming evidence that 1) climate sensitivity is likely high, 2) even if it wasn’t, anthropogenic forces still account for 50% or more of the warming (from CO2 alone, not counting methane and other greenhouse gases), and 3) that when you ‘lengthen’ the piece of string, there is still ample evidence ample evidence supporting the fact that CO2 can drive temperatures. The consensus itself does not prove AGW—but the evidence proves the consensus. CO2 is the main driver of recent temperature changes.</t>

    <t>AGW Models fail, so the theory is wrongWe have agreed on a couple of basic points of climate science: 1. If AGW is true then warming should occur as a straight line over time. 2. The heat output of the sun is not changing, so that isn't upsetting the straight line AGW So, if AGW has dominated climate over last century then we should see a straight line increase in temperature over the century, with just short term variations due to weather. Here is the temperature data. Pro told us in his initial argument that the minimum value for climate sensitivity under AGW is 3 degrees per century. He said it might be more, but it's at least three degrees. To test if AGW dominates climate, we can see how close the temperature data is to a straight line with a three dree slope. I took the temperature from Wikipedia [1] and added the line (in blue) predicted by AGW:  Clearly AGW theory is wrong. It's possible that carbon dioxide is adding a temperature increase to climate just as AGW predicts, but that some other unaccounted factor is canceling the AGW before about 1980 and after about 2000. Our debate is about whether AGW dominates climate, so if it is try that an unknown factor completely changes climate from what AGW contributes, then it is the unknown factor that dominates, not AGW.  Why did a theory so far from the data ever take hold? The problem AGW attempts to explain is the rise from about 1980 to 1996, and many atmospheric scientists could not come up with an explanation other than CO2. To explain all the pre-1980 data that did not conform, Professor Mann and his colleagues came up with the Hockey Stick curve, that purported to show that climate had not changed at all in the past 1000 years. The Hockey Stick turned out to be the product of a bad statistical method that selected proxies for temperature that were unrelated to temperature. The current Wikipedia article on the Hockey Stick shows the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age as global climate change. Both are explained by solar magnetic theory.  The fatal blow to AGW theory is the lack of warming since 1996. The blue curve on the graph shows how far we are below the AGW theoretical prediction. Pro argues that the HADCru data shows some warming, but there is close to universal agreement that the models have failed. HADCru uses ground station data which focuses on urban areas that warm due to growth with surrounding population increase. The satellite data covers the whole earth with no such complications. NASA acknowledges the pause in global warming [2] the ‘pause’ in global surface temperature that began in 1997, according to some estimates, continues,” wrote David Whitehouse, who holds a doctorate in astrophysics and was the BBC’s science editor. “Statistically speaking there has been no trend in global temperatures over this period.” HADCru fully acknowledges the existence of the pause in global warming, but dutifully insists that the underlying AGW has just been overcome by other factors. Those factors must, of course, now dominate AGW. [3] Papers by von Storch [4] and Rasmussen [5], both previously vigorous defenders of AGW, show the AGW models have failed. Not only have the models failed, but there is no way to tweak them, say by changing climate sensitivity, to get them to fit the data. A book by Tisdale [6] shows graphically that the models cannot be fixed.  Measures of Solar ActivityRemember, I'm not obliged to explain why the AGW models have failed, only that there is no possibility that the AGW linear trend of 3 degrees per century, which Pro claimed as all but certain science, is not true so that AGW is not dominating climate. The exact nature of the sun's influence on climate is not known, and Pro argues convoincingly that the length of the solar cycle has not been born out as being as good a predictor as thought. Nonetheless the correlation to solar activity remains strong. The long Medieval Cold Period, the Medieval Warm Period, and the Little Ice Age all corrsponded to solar activity. [6]Right now we are in a period of decreasing sunspot activity [7]:  That the correlation to sunspot activity is not perfect means no more than that climate is complex. To say that AGW dominates climate is unfounded, because there is all but universal agreement that the models have failed.Paleoclimate That CO2 lags warming is uncontested basic physics. As the oceans heat, CO2 comes out of solution and CO2 enters the atmosphere. If it amplifies heating trends, that is no proof that CO2 dominates climate. Whatever starts and ends the heating trend dominates climate and CO2 magnifies the swings in boith directions.Whether the present is warmer than the Medieval Warm Period or the Roman Warm Period is not the slightest proof of what caused any of the warming or cooling. What is does show is that substantial warming in past climate has happened without any CO2 effect. If we got nearly as warm as the present in the MWP. then whatever caused that was not CO2 and may be working now.The long history of climate shows very little relationship to CO2, and Pro acknoweldges that. So what factors were at work, and how do we know what is at work now?  Variations in the earth's orbit are not nearly enough to explain the changes. We have some ideas, but there is nothing that's proved reliable, especially not AGW theory.Pro burden is no more than to prove that AGW dominates climate. He has not done so.</t>

    <t>AGW exists, it but doesn't dominate climate Greenhouse gases cause warming, and I never claimed otherwise. Pro cited a skeptical climate scientist acknowledgment that AGW plays some role in climate. Our resolution is “Global warming is man made.” That might mean that global warming is entirely man made, in which case Pro has conceded it is not, because he has acknowledged that there are also natural causes. I didn't take that meaning. I said repeatedly that Pro must prove that climate is dominated by AGW. I must prove it does not. The proof of AGW would be a AGW math mathematical model of climate that accurately explains and predicts. Weather effects are yearly variations; climate comprises trends over several years. The AGW models fail because the models do not predict or explain climate the large trends in climate. For example, Pro acknowledges that Medieval Warm Period was due to solar activity, but the official IPCC models have no mechanism that explains the MWP. Because AGW models cannot explain the MWP, climate crisis advocates have fought consistently to make the MWP disappear as a global climate phenomena. The Hockey Stick got rid of it by a statistical error, but the data ultimately won. A change in climate acknowledged to be very close to modern warming is unexplained by the models we are supposed to accept as reliable. The pause in global warming is real Pro argued that an 17 year pause in global warming might just be “noise,” and he cited a scientific paper that allegedly shows that. That's bad science. Suppose an engineer designed a building taking into account all the other factors he knew to affect design, and the building subsequently collapsed. Consider: “The design models were correct. The building collapsed due to unknown factors categorized as noise. There is no need for further explanation.” Nonsense. Fundamental failures are not noise. An eighteen year failure of climate prediction shows that the model is defective. Since AGW is in the model, and something else canceled it, the unknown factor dominated climate over the period. I quoted both HADCru and NASA scientists as acknowledging the pause in global warming. The paper by AGW-advocate von Storch established that the current models cannot be tweaked to explain the pause. Pro found some oddball paper that made a model that shows a pause, but models can be made to do anything desired. AGW theory is not validated until after it makes accurate predictions. Making a new, unproved model means we are back to the starting point. Pro said that HADCru land data showed an increase. Year-to-year variations occur with weather, and so there is so uncertainty in the trends due to the accuracy of fitting a line through the weather-induced variations. The HADCru data shows 0.09 +/- 0.11 degree of global warming over the period of the pause, compared to the 0.4 to 1 degree predicted by the AGW models. None of the six global temperature data sets showed a statistically significant increase. The land data sets are the least accurate because increasing urbanization drives up the temperatures near many of the weather station locations, due to the so-called “heat island” effect. The satellite data is the most accurate because it samples the earth uniformly, and it shows no increase. HADCru scientists understand the large departure from the models, and acknowledge the pause. Pro said I acknowledged that the Sun could not be causing the pause in global warming. That's not true, but if it were true, it would not help Pro's case. If it's not the sun, then a completely unsuspected factor dominated climate and overwhelmed AGW. However, what I acknowledged was that the length of the previous solar cycle was not a good predictor. I presented the historical graph that showed the level of sunspot activity correlated well with the warmth of the MWP, the cold of the Little Ice Age, and the warming of the 20th century. Pro acknowledged the solar cause of those changes. Sunspots do not correlate to the heat output of the sun, so the effect on climate must be a different physical cause: magnetic field, cosmic rays, ultraviolet spectrum, or something else. It might be some complex combination of the effects. The graphs show that cold climate is associated with low sunspot activity and warm climate with high sunspot activity. The 20th century covered a long period of high sunspot activity, which explains the warming. Recently, sunspot activity has dropped, correlated to the pause. The number of sunspots remains a reliable longer term climate predictor. AGW predicts straight line temperature increase I presented a graph showing actual global temperatures and AGW predicting a strong straight line increase. My graph is accurate, but I should have better explained the AGW line in comparison to the actual climate data. Here is the graph, repeated from the earlier round:   Temperature responds to the logarithm of greenhouse gas density, and greenhouse gas density has been increasing exponentially. The log of an exponential is a straight line. As far as I know, all climate scientists agree on this. Therefore, AGW should produce a straight line. Pro said that the models also include some natural effects like volcanoes, so the model predictions need not be a straight line increase. However, the debate resolution is that AGW dominates climate. While natural causes upset the perfect straight line behavior to some degree, they cannot dominate. While there may be some blips, like the blip of cold for a couple years from the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo, there should be no problem recognizing a straight line. The temperature data is not close to any straight line, so AGW is not dominating. We are far below what the models predict for the present year. The slope of the line of temperature increase over time depends both on climate sensitivity and the rate of carbon dioxide increase. The behavior of temperature with CO2 is logarithmic, so Pro's computation of what it should be is way off. Initially a small increase in CO2 produces a large increase in temperature, with later increases in CO2 having less and less effect. Suppose CO2 increased in units from 1 to 16, and that the increase from from 1 to 2 brought one degree of warming. That means that there would be four degrees of warming at 16, CO2 having doubled four times. Linear interpolation, which is what Pro did, between 1 and 16 says that there should be (1/15) of the 4 degrees, 0.27 degree, at 2 units. In fact, there was 1 degree of increase at the 2 unit point, four times as much as linear interpolation erroneously yields. The temperature rise is not line between 1 and 2 or between 2 and 4, or anywhere on the curve. I converted the combined effect of climate sensitivity and CO2 increase into a linear number of degrees increase per century increase. The official estimate by the US Environment Protection Agency, referencing the IPCC, is 2.2 to 6.1 degrees C by 2100. (I converted from the EPA's F). That's 2.6 to 7.1 degrees per century. The range includes both the allowed variation in the estimates of climate sensitivity and the possibility that CO2 output may drop near the end of the century, as substitutes for fossil fuels become more significant. Departure from exponential growth is in the future so I used 3 degrees per century to represent the low end of climate sensitivity estimates that AGW theory allows. It's a coincidence that matches 3 degrees for doubling CO2. The earth should have warmed by 0.4 to 1 degree since 2000, but in fact as measured by the satellites there was no change, and in all data sets show no statistically significant change. The graph shows temperature anomaly, so where the blue line ought to originate depends upon when one believes AGW began to dominate climate. AGW theory was invented to explain the temperature rise from about 1980 to 1996, so that's where I put the AGW prediction line. The Hockey stick claimed that nothing happened to climate for a thousand years before about 1970. If the claim is that AGW dominated the entire 20th century, then the line should start at 1900. If climate sensitivity is 0.7, way below any AGW official estimate, then the line is about 0.5 degree per century. and AGW no longer explains the rise in the 80s and 90s. Wrong consensus derives from common error When science reaches a wrong consensus, scientists point to the data that they used to proclaim that the wrong consensus is well founded. I gave several examples. For AGW, it was the rapid temperature increase in the 80s and 90s that “proved” the theory. Some AGW is in the climate, but the long pause proves it is not the dominant factor. Paleoclimate In the hundred million year history of climate, CO2 shows no relation to temperature. The laws of nature do not change. It's not enough to say that things were different back then. The changes in the orbit of the earth were too small to explain the climate variation. The likely missing link is the solar variation other than heat output that caused the MWP. CO2 released from the ocean will increase heating, and CO2 going back into solution will amplify cooling. Those are natural, not anthropogenic, factors and they do nothing to explain what drives the trend in either direction. (I wrongly identified my reference for the lag in CO2; it's 3-5.) The Debate Pro's rules for the debate say that we have an equal burden to prove that AGW does or not dominate climate. That's fine with me. If AGW was the dominant factor in climate, then we should have observed a straight line increase in temperature since 1980, and we clearly have not. Since Pro has not met his burden of showing that AGW dominates, I've met my burden to show it has not. Thanks to Pro for a fine debate. It will be most fascinating to people interested in logarithms.</t>

    <t>== Roy’s calculation ==   Roy’s assumption that warming is linear is simply untrue:  Even though CO2 is the dominant climate driver of modern climate-change, it does not mean natural climate variability cannot occur in the system—it does occur. A few ‘pauses’ or unprecedented accelerations do occur. CO2 is logarithmic in relation to temperature. This means that every CO2 doubling has the same effect, even though each molecule warms less. For example, a doubling from 100 ppm to 200 ppm would have the same effect as a doubling from 280 to 560 ppm. Warming will only occur fairly linearly if each doubling occurs at the same rate.  His calculation uses faulty assumptions. His 3 degrees C slope is from my former argument that CO2 sensitivity is around 3 degrees C. Sensitivity is for each CO2 doubling.  His line begins in about 1970, and CO2 has not doubled from 1970 to now (in terms of the pre-industrial levels). In 1970 there was about 323 ppm of CO2, and in 2014 the number is around 400 [1][2]. So over that time period, CO2 increased 77 ppm. That would only be about 13.2% of a CO2 doubling. So .132 * 3 is about .4 degrees temperature rise since 1970. It has warmed about 0.5 degrees since the 1970s [3]. Therefore when Roy’s calculation is done correctly, CO2 is responsible for 80% of the temperature rise over that time period.    == Climate model accuracy ==    Roy argues that global circulation models (GCMs) are inaccurate. This is untrue. Climate models actually have accurately reproduced temperature since 1900. GCMs cannot replicate warming without a CO2 forcing.  GCM’s are only accurate when CO2 forcing is accounted for in  hindcasts. This means that CO2 is a large forcing of modern climate. This can be demonstrated with the following graph [4]:   Models also reproduced temperatures after the Mt. Pinatubo eruption. They correctly predicted the temporary 0.5 degrees C cooling after the eruption, meaning models can replicate temperature changes due to aerosol and sulfate forcings [4].  A paper published in Nature looked at each 15 year period since the 1950s. Their models were able to accurately produce those trends as well as many El Nino events. The study even commented on the pause. The authors note that the pause does not falsify model accuracy, as it is only “one realization where the decadal natural variability component of the model climate is generally not in phase with observations” [5]. In other words, it is the exception rather than the rule. Models accurately predict warming trends, one exception does not falsify the models. In fact, they note models still were able to predict recent trends in the Pacific—a huge portion of the world.  Hansen’s 1988 model, unlike what skeptics claim, shows close correspondence with the actual temperature change. His model seemingly assumes more warming due to the fact he assumed 25% too much climate sensitivity. When the sensitivity is lowered to 3 degrees C, his scenario B correlates perfectly with observed temperatures [6]. The model offers evidence of a 3 degrees C climate sensitivity. Models can accurately hindcast warming which occurred in the last century and models can accurately predict the cooling forcings of aerosols. Further, the 1988 model predictions were correct, indicating that models can predict future temperatures.    == The ‘pause’ ==    The argument that the ‘pause’ disproves global warming is incorrect. The fact that other forcings can *temporarily* blunt the warming effect of CO2 is not a nail in the coffin. Unless Roy denies the greenhouse effect, it is preposterous to claim that CO2 cannot influence temperatures. The fact that natural forcings have caused a short-term ‘pause’ does not disprove AGW. Some models actually have predicted the ‘pause’ [7].   The Met Office has released a report regarding the ‘pause’. They note that the earth’s heat content is still increasing, and is actually increasing faster than ever before. Surface warming has slowed due to the fact that the oceans have been accumulating more heat. This effect is temporary. Eventually, the ocean’s heat content will ‘max out’, and surface warming will resume. So CO2 is still warming the climate system [8]. As noted, this effect is temporary, and as heat continues to accumulate the  oceans will warm, and surface temperatures will eventually begin to increase. CO2 forcing has not stopped—its heat is merely being distributed elsewhere.  The earth’s surface has stopped warming not due to CO2 not being a greenhouse gas, but rather its heat content being distributed elsewhere. There is still doubt as to whether or not the ‘pause’ is real (as I noted last round).  Tamino, a statistician, has worked out the data. Using each possible start date for the ‘pause’, he ran the p-value of statistical significance. For each start date, none of them reach the 95% statistical significance level. Therefore, no matter which data-set you use, no matter what start date you use, there is no proof of a statistically significant slowdown in global temperatures. The following chart [9] details the results:   Therefore, there is little proof that a ‘pause’ is occurring at all.    == Solar activity ==   Roy argues the sun caused the LIA and the MWP. I agree! CO2 was fairly stable in those time periods, so it could not have been the forcing. Climate reacts to whatever is forcing it to change at the time. As I convincingly argued (CON’s words), the sun cannot be the current forcing. CO2 has been increasing, and likely is the current climate forcing. I never said that the sun couldn’t affect climate. I merely stated that cosmic rays do not change the climate, and that the sun is not the driver of current climate change. As noted, solar forcing has been decreasing, meaning it cannot be the cause of modern warming.   TSI has been falling, GCR’s have been increasing, and solar cycle lengths have fallen as temperature dramatically increased. The sun cannot be the forcing behind the current warming—it is impossible. I have cited many peer-reviewed studies corroborating those conclusions.    == Paleoclimate ==   This entire argument proved that CO2 has the potential to change climate. CON claims I said CO2 does not correlate with temperature. This is a massive misinterpretation. I first cited the study which every paleoclimatologist uses in their datasets, the GEOCARB study. The study found that CO2 did correlate with temperature. I then cited Royer 2006, which noted how CO2 does correlate with temperature when 1) pH effects are corrected for, and 2) the sun is accounted for. The sun does not correlate with temperatures, but it obviously affects climate. It only correlates with temperatures when CO2 forcing is included. Therefore, we can conclude that CO2 is one of the main drivers of past climate. This proves that CO2 has the ability to warm the planet, meaning the increased emissions have had a warming effect.  Research using proxy data over the last 500 million years find a climate sensitivity of 3 degrees C [9]. This supports the idea that the modern increase of CO2 concentrations are having a large effect on modern climate.  Roy again claims the CO2 lag refutes AGW. I already responded to this. CO2 has lagged temperatures over the previous interglacial periods, I agree. But CO2 acts as an amplifier in those conditions. If CO2 amplifies temperature, it has a warming effect. If it has a warming effect, it can be a forcing. Therefore, CO2 has an effect on temperature, and can be the driving force behind modern climate change. The lag argument was solidly refuted last round.  Roy also dropped my argument about CO2 causing the end of the last ice-age. This argument definitively proves that CO2 has a massive impact on temperatures.  The fact that it is warmer now than in the MWP demonstrates that the current warming is unprecedented. I have proven that the modern warm period is warmer now than at any point during the past 2000+years.    == Burden of proof ==    Roy claims I have not proven AGW. This is incorrect.  When it comes to sensitivity, CO2 has a *direct* effect on temperature: each doubling causes about 1.1 degrees C warming. Using calculations from a skeptical physicist [10], this direct effect means that CO2 has caused over 50% of the recent warming. Sensitivity is likely much higher, about 3 degrees C. With higher sensitivity, CO2 causes more warming. This is corroborated with studies using many different methods. With the high sensitivity proven (R1), CO2 is the main factor of modern climate change. Roy dropped this argument.  I proved there was a scientific consensus. This suggests the empirical evidence almost certainly corroborates AGW theory. I proved that CO2 is one of the main forcings in past climate. This is important because it dispels any doubts that CO2 has a large warming potential. In fact, paleoclimate proves 3 degrees sensitivity. Therefore, this also proves that CO2 is the main driver of modern climate change.  I have proven that CO2 does change climate. The direct effect of CO2 (which no one disputes) causes over 50% of climate change, and when sensitivity is 3 degrees C, CO2 is the cause of the warming since 1970. I have upheld the BOP. Roy, on the other hand, has failed to explain *why* CO2 is either not a forcing, or that my sensitivity estimate is wrong. He drops the sensitivity argument, conceding that CO2 is the main driver of warming in the modern era. His alternative explanation, the sun, was eviscerated last round. His arguments about a ‘pause’ are also put into question, and his model argument is based upon flawed assumptions. I have, on many occasions, cited Roy’s evidence against him. Low sensitivity proves AGW, high sensitivity proves AGW, and Roy totally ignored that key point. Therefore, I have proven that AGW exists, whereas Roy fails to put a dent into the extremely well supported theory.    Thanks for the debate, Roy, it was fun! Please, vote PRO!</t>
<h>    == Roy’s calculation ==   Roy’s assumption that warming is linear is simply untrue:  Even though CO2 is the dominant climate driver of modern climate-change, it does not mean natural climate variability cannot occur in the system—it does occur.</h>

    <t>I would like to thank TylerGraham95 for this truly excellent debate. I've learned a lot from your arguments and my own research. In this round, I will consider the objections my opponent has to my arguments. The Sun My opponent is making two mistakes. One in thermodynamics, and the other in how solar activity is measured. Solar activity is the highest is about 8000 years. Here is a graph showing sunspot number over the past 10000 years:   [1] While solar activity has decreased, it is still at a very high level compared to recent times in the Earth's history. This means that the temperature will still increase because solar activity is still historically high. Even on the scale of the 20th century, solar activity is high.“Clearly the sun’s activity and output experienced an upwards step-change around 1950. The average monthly sunspots in the second half of the century were, for example, 50% higher than in the first half of the century.” Overall, because solar activity is still high in comparison, temperatures continue to increase.[2] As for the error in how solar activity is measured, “Since the late 1970s, the amount of solar radiation the sun emits, during times of quiet sunspot activity, has increased by nearly .05 percent per decade... This trend is important because, if sustained over many decades, it could cause significant climate change... TSI [Total Solar Irradiance] interaction with the Earth's atmosphere, oceans and landmasses is the biggest factor determining our climate.” So there's still more solar radiation reaching Earth than earlier.[3] See this graph:   It shows a peak right at the time that temperature was increasing quickly, and decreases right before the temperature decrease (see below). Finally, consider the global temperature stagnation over the last 15 years. If the satellite based temperature is considered (which starts in the 1970s) there is an unmistakable pause in global warming starting around 2000:   [4] Overall, thermodynamics, how solar activity should really be measured, and the pause in global warming all show how the sun is still the dominant factor determining the climate. The Hockey Stick The hockey stick is wildly inaccurate: “The dataset used to make this construction contained collation errors, unjustified truncation or extrapolation of source data, obsolete data, incorrect principal component calculations, geographical mislocations and other serious defects. These errors and defects substantially affect the temperature index. The major finding is that the values in the early 15th century exceed any values in the 20th century. The particular hockey stick shape derived in the MBH98 proxy construction a temperature index that decreases slightly between the early 15th century and early 20th century and then increases dramatically up to 1980 is primarily an artefact of poor data handling, obsolete data and incorrect calculation of principal components.”[5][6] Temperatures have been warmer than today as recently as 1300 ACE.'During the Medieval Warming... . Temperatures may have been as much as 2.5 degrees C warmer [than today] due to a southward shift of the climate belts.'[7] This graph shows the hockey stick graph and the corrected version of it:   Cosmic Rays My opponent's whole argument against cosmic rays is one whole quote that provides no evidence for its conclusion. I have made a sufficient case for how cosmic rays amplify the sun's effects on the climate, and my opponent has not touched it. As for the Forbes source (I contend that Popsci isn't bad, but I'll leave that alone to save space), thank you for pointing that out. That was part of a two-year old argument that I need to get rid of. Here is a better source: “Ironically, solar explosions, which produce their own deadly radiation, sweep away the even deadlier cosmic rays. As flares subside, cosmic rays intensify.” Further, this Nature study shows how cosmic rays cause cloud formation (source 9). I feel like I've supported my cloud argument enough, and with good sources to preclude me from having to post more on that matter.[8][9] To conclude, here's a graph:   [5]The bottom graph corrects for a few variables, so it shows a better correlation.  Extraterrestrial Warming I've addressed the argument about solar irradiance, and the source I posted showed how all the planets were warming. Unfortunately, there's not enough evidence on this, but there's sufficient evidence that Mars, the Moon, Jupiter, Pluto, and Neptune are warming, and indirect evidence that the other planets are warming. This shows the comparison between the Sun's, the Earth's, and Neptune's activity:   [5]Noitce how they all follow the same pattern, which shows they're connected.  I need to develop my argument more in other places, so considering my opponent doesn't consider this argument much either, I'll leave it at this. Source 10 (one of the blogs my opponent says is invalid) contains peer-reviewed articles of that evidence, however.[10][11] The Sun, Cosmic Rays, and the Evidence for Natural Warming 'In particular, a quasi-60-year large cycle is quite evident since 1650 in all climate and astronomical records herein studied ... The existence of a natural 60-year cyclical modulation of the global surface temperature induced by astronomical mechanisms, by alone, would imply that at least 60 to 70% of the warming observed since 1970 has been naturally induced.'[12][13] 'For example, the authors of a paper by NASA's JPL remark '...has compared the minimum aa [index of geomagnetic activity] values with the Earth's surface temperature record and found a correlation of 0.95 between the two data sets starting in 1885. The solar irradiance [solar activity] proxy developed from the aa minima continues to track the Earth's surface temperature until the present.''[14][15] As for Scafetta and West, the paper my opponent cites acknowledges that there might be a non-CO2 reason why this is true. See the whole paragraph after my opponent's quote in my source 16 (his source 3 from round 3). Further, they argue in a different article that “...the current anthropogenic contribution to global warming is significantly overestimated. We estimate that the Sun could account for as much as 69% [from a different starting year] the increase in Earth's average temperature, depending on the TSI reconstruction used.” Overall, my opponent's argument against this study does not hold water.[16][17] A solar explanation for the recent global warming is the only one that agrees with its predictions and the observations made. The actual scientific data does not agree with him. Attack on Opponent's Sources My source 3 also says this: “[Fred] Singer counters the standard scientific stance that changes in solar activity are not significant enough to have an effect, stating that solar variability is much greater in ultraviolet regions, thus having a significant effect on ozone levels and consequently a major impact on atmospheric circulation.” It takes an objective standpoint (it doesn't take sides), and I was only citing it to show the solar cycle length/temperature correlation. Singer has a PhD in physics (he's reliable). I've already conceded my sources 5 and 6 and have exchanged them for better ones. Again, thank you for calling me out on it. Watts Up With That is a bit complicated. For one, while it's run by Anthony Watts, most of the articles are by guest authors, often with degrees explaining their papers, or use reputable sources if written by Watts. You can take a look at each individual article for yourself and see that they have substantiation. Further, “Patrick J. Michaels, climatologist and contributor to the IPCC first assessment report, described WUWT as part of a new 'parallel universe' of emerging online publications, manned by serious scientists critical of world governments approach to climate change: 'A parallel universe is assembling itself parallel to the IPCC. This universe has become very technical – very proficient at taking apart the U.N.'s findings.'” Michaels has a PhD in environmental climatology.[18][19] The book Unstoppable Global Warming: Every 1,500 Years is very reliable. It contains 499 studies for substantiation, including a large number substantiating the quotes I made. While past climactic conditions don't negate AGW, if there were periods in recent history that were much hotter and warmed much quicker than the recent global warming, that throws suspicion and the supposed remark-ability of the recent global warming. It also provides evidence for a solar explanation and against an anthropogenic explanation. Sources 9 and 11 do provide reliable sources, and source 9 itself looks pretty good. I'll concede source 12, but I feel the quote I quoted from it makes general sense. Source 20 provides a better source for that quote (regarding the distribution of solar radiation).[20] Finally, now my own attack on one of my opponent's sources – Skeptical Science. Just to take one example, “The fact that there has been no statistically-significant global warming for 16 years is described as a “myth”. Yet the least-squares linear-regression trend on the Hadley Centre/CRU dataset favoured by the IPCC indeed shows no statistically-significant warming for 16 years.” I've shown this above. There's a list of 11 more points in source 21.[21] Also from that source, “Yet half of the 129 signatories are Professors; two-thirds are PhDs, and several are Expert Reviewers for the IPCC’s forthcoming Fifth Assessment Report.” Another confirmation on WUWT.[21] Conclusion I have shown how a solar cause to the recent global warming is the only reasonable explanation, much better than a human-caused greenhouse gas cause. The latter theory simply has too many problems with it to hold any water, while the former's case is practically airtight, save an exact description of how the sun affects the climate. It is known that it does, however, even recently. Overall, mankind is not the main cause of global warming. Sources Sources in comments.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank tylergraham95 for presenting his well-thought out arguments. In this round, I will post arguments against an anthropogenic cause to the recent global warming, and also consider as much as I can of my opponent's argument. Arguments Against Human-Caused Global Warming There are many indicators that point to CO2 emissions not being the cause of the modern global warming.First, CO2 is actually a lagging indicator compared to temperature. As it turns out, temperature may be what's causing CO2 levels to rise. 'The most recent study on this concluded that the results of their tedious but meticulous analysis led them to ultimately conclude that 'the CO2 increase lagged Antarctic deglacial warming by 800 +/- 200 years.' There is also shorter correlations, but again, temperature seems to cause CO2 rise instead of the reverse.[1][2]This graph shows just one of the lags:   Second, according to the greenhouse effect, global warming should be starting from the lower atmosphere and moving to the surface (because the CO2 collects in the upper troposphere first). However, this is not happening. '...satellite and high-altitude balloon data confirm that the lower atmosphere is not trapping lots of additional heat due to higher CO2 concentrations. It is hard to know how fast the Earth's highly variable surface is warming, but it is warming faster than the lower atmosphere where the CO2 is accumulating. This is strong evidence that CO2 is not the primary climate factor.'[3]Here is a graph showing how the surface has warmed more than the troposphere:   (The blue line is lower tropospheric temperatures)Third, global warming is not starting at the poles like it should be, by the greenhouse theory. In fact, there has been general, relative cooling: 'If the greenhouse theory were valid, temperatures in the Arctic and the Antarctic would have risen several degrees Celsius since 1940 due to the huge emissions of man-made CO2... Recently, a team led by the University of Chicago's Peter Doran published a paper in Nature saying, 'Although previous reports suggest recent continental warming, our spatial analysis of Antarctic meteorological data demonstrates a net cooling on the Antarctic continent between 1966 and 2000'. The data from 21 Antarctic surface stations show an average continental decline of 0.008 degrees C from 1978 to 1998, and the infrared data from satellites operating since 1979 show a decline of 0.42 degrees C per decade. David W. J. Thompson of Colorado State University and Susan Soloman of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration also report a cooling trend in the Antarctic interior.'[3][4]To illustrate, here is a picture of the southern hemisphere sea ice anomaly, which shows that southern sea ice is actually increasing: [5] Fourth, current levels of CO2 have very little effect on temperature. The greenhouse effect certainly exists, but it doesn't become linearly stronger with increasing amounts of CO2. CO2's effect on temperature is logarithmic, meaning that each additional increase has a smaller effect on the climate than the last. 'The carbon that is already up in the atmosphere absorbs most of the light it can. CO2 only soaks up its favorite wavelengths of light and it's close to its saturation point. It manages to grab a bit more light from wavelengths that are close to its favorite bands but it can't do much more, because there are not many left-over photons at the right wavelengths.' This has to do with how CO2's absorption spectrum overlaps with water vapor's.[1][6][7]This chart shows approximately the effect that each additional increment of CO2 increase has on temperature: Note how the pre-industrial to modern level increase has had less than a 0.2 C increase in temperature.Fifth and most importantly, the predicted 'hot-spot' 10 miles above the tropics that would be a signature of CO2-induced global warming is absent. 'The computer models show that greenhouse warming will cause a hot-spot at an altitude between 8 and 12 km over the tropics between 30 N and 30 S. The temperature at this hot-spot is projected to increase at a rate of two to three times faster than at the surface. However, the Hadley Centre's real-world plot of radiosonde temperature observations shown below does not show the projected CO2 induced global warming hot-spot at all. The predicted hot-spot is entirely absent from the observational record. This shows that atmosphere warming theory programmed into climate models are wrong.'[1]Here is the plot of predicted temperature changes due to CO2:   However, here is the actual observed temperature changes:   The hot spot is completely missing, which is pretty much a knockout blow to the anthropogenic global warming theory. However, the correlation isn't even there. See the below graph:   In case the graph's methodology is questioned, consider this: “The Carboniferous Period and the Ordovician Period were the only geological periods during the Paleozoic Era when global temperatures were as low as they are today. To the consternation of global warming proponents, the Late Ordovician Period was also an Ice Age while at the same time CO2 concentrations then were nearly 12 times higher than today-- 4400 ppm. According to greenhouse theory, Earth should have been exceedingly hot. Instead, global temperatures were no warmer than today. Clearly, other factors besides atmospheric carbon influence earth temperatures and global warming.”[8] Surely these periods should have been warmer. Surely some other factor did not outweigh CO2 by that much. Even climate sensitivity cannot account for something as drastic as that. Further, CO2 concentrations have been much higher - as much as 7000 ppm in the Cambrian period. I'm not going to argue that humans have not caused the CO2 increase, but it kind of shows how an increase of 100 ppm is rather insignificant. Even if the graph is analyzed, the correlation just isn't there. Even so, again, CO2 seems to lag temperature changes anyway. As for humidity, it is, in fact, decreasing. “This shows that the actual water vapor content in the upper troposphere has declined by 13.7% (best fit line) from 1948 to 2012 at the 400 mb pressure level. The climate models predict that humidity will increase in the upper troposphere, but the data shows a large decrease; just where water vapor changes have the greatest effect on global temperatures.”[1] This graph shows this:   The two feedbacks, water vapor feedback and cloud feedback, are weak. The fact that humidity is decreasing negates the former. However, even if the humidity were increasing, more lower level clouds would form, which block sunlight from reaching the Earth, essentially negating the warming effect of the water vapor. Further, while higher numbers of cirrus clouds (which supposedly would increase in the scenario) cause warming, what has actually been found was that cirrus clouds were decreasing in number. “What we found in month-to-month fluctuations of the tropical climate system was a strongly negative feedback. As the tropical atmosphere warms, cirrus clouds decrease. That allows more infrared heat to escape from the atmosphere into outer space...'it would reduce estimates of future warming by over 75 percent.”[1][9][10] Finally, global warming is not happening unbelievably fast. “Temperature changes recorded in the GISP2 ice core ... show that the global warming experienced during the past century pales into insignificance when compared to the magnitude of profound climate reversals over the past 25,000 years. In addition, small temperature changes of up to a degree or so, similar to those observed in the 20th century record, occur persistently throughout the ancient climate record.”[1][11] This graph shows this:   It doesn't look different than all the rest of the warmings. It even looks rather moderate. The Consensus The problem with any consensus argument, no matter how strong, is that science does not work by consensus. Michael Crichton has said, “Consensus is the business of politics. Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world. In science consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus.”[1] There have been many false consensuses in history. Heliocentrism, evolution, the big bang theory, continental drift, and even climate change itself used to be ridiculed by the majority of scientists. There's no reason why this consensus should be believed above all of the other false ones. Even so, the consensus is based off of a misrepresentation of the data, and a selective look at studies. Over 31,000 scientists (with at least a Bachelors' degree in relevant fields, and over 9000 PhDs) have signed a petition saying that global warming is not anthropogenic. “Only 41 out of the 11,944 published climate papers Cook examined explicitly stated that Man caused most of the warming since 1950. Cook himself had flagged just 64 papers as explicitly supporting that consensus, but 23 of the 64 had not in fact supported it. A book I own (but unfortunately don't have access to at this moment) cites over 500 studies that don't believe in the whole global warming edifice, showing various inconsistencies in the hockey stick graph (i.e. the 1500-year cycle), that the sun causes global warming, and that CO2 cannot be causing global warming, other things.[3][12][13][14] Conclusion There are many arguments against the anthropogenic global warming theory, and there are many problems with the assumptions it makes. The consensus is based off of a false understanding of how scientific hypotheses are supported, and isn't even true anyway. Overall, the anthropogenic global warming theory does not hold water against its own assumptions and predictions. Sources Sources in comments.</t>

    <t>Thanks to subutai for posting an excellent opening round! I'm looking forward to this debate, as I am sure it will be an interesting one!So to kick this thing off I'd like to start by providing the readers with a quick road map of my case and how I aim to negate the given resolution.What I am going to do is set up the basis of a cause effect relationship between greenhouse gases (Such as CO2, Methane, and Water Vapor) and a warming trend, and then confirm this relationship with corroborating corollaries. This will prove that increased atmospheric GHG concentrations to create a warming effect on the climate.Next, I will begin to discuss why humanities effect on the climate creates an increased concentration of atmospheric greenhouse gases, thus creating an anthropogenic cause for global warming.Then, I will establish why the current warming trend cannot be due primarily to natural causes.Finally, to seal in these arguments, I will discuss the consensus of the scientific community as a whole regarding anthropogenic global warming.Con's CaseI. The Greenhouse effect and Greenhouse GasesTo begin, let's examine what exactly makes a green house gas, a green house gas. Everyone has likely heard of the most common GHGs: Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), and Water Vapor (H2O). Why, though, do these gases cause a warming effect, while the gases most prevalent in our atmosphere, Nitrogen and Oxygen, cause no warming? A) Di-pole momentExamine the following diagram describing the molecular structures of the gases above. So here we have CO2, Methane, Water Vapor, Nitrogen, and Oxygen in either 3d models, or Lewis structures. The thing we must pay closest attention to is their molecular shape (VSEPR Theory). Carbon Dioxide is bent. Methane is tetrahedral. H2O is Bent. Nitrogen and oxygen, however, are Linear diatomic molecules [1].Now, every element has a different level of electronegativity. In an atom with an electronegativity disparity, a dipole moment forms [2]. This is essentially the formation of a magnetic field direction. CO2 and H2O due to their bent asymmetrical shapes have Dipole moments. The dipole moment 'points' from the more electronegative towards the less electronegative. More +--gt; LessWhen an atom is struck by particular wavelengths of infrared light, the bonds in the atom begin to 'vibrate' there are many kinds of vibration that can occur (bending, stretching, etc). [3] This causes the molecules to shift around, and in greenhouse gases, the dipole moment is shifted. Now atoms like N2 and O2 have no dipole moment, and no amount of shifting disrupts their symmetry. CO2 and H2O always have their dipole moment shifted by molecular vibration. Methane, due to the complexity of tetrahedral molecular shape, can undergo several vibrations that disrupt the symmetry of the molecule, and cause dipole moments to form.When a dipole moment is shifted or formed, much energy is released as heat. This is what happens in greenhouse gases [4].This is why greenhouse gases heat the earth when they are present in the atmosphere. Light from the sun strikes the molecule, and the infrared spectra that result in molecular vibration release heat energy into the atmosphere. Every single one of the billions of GHGs in the atmosphere are each acting as individual heat generators, catching and trapping energy from the sun, and heating the earth.B) Corollaries (Paleoclimate)Paleoclimates have historically been a major focal point of many debates on anthropogenic global warming. Therefore, I will preempt these arguments, so that time may be saved in the rebuttals. I will also reestablish the cause that I have described previously, and corroborate through corollaries.Many climate change skeptics have claimed that there is 'No historic correlation' between the presence of green-house gases and global temperature. According to Royers 2006 [4] the data previously observed on the phanerzoic era has been contaminated, as it has not been adjusted for pH, which affects the molecular shape, atmospheric concentration, dipole moment, and molecular vibration potential of CO2. Quote Royer, 'the temperature data correlate strongly with both the record of continental gla-ciation and atmospheric CO2'. Furthermore, the famous Vostok Ice Cores show that 'there is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr.' [5]During the cenzoic period as well, CO2 was the driving force of Global warming, cite Hansen and Sato [6].II. Climate Sensitivity/CarbonAnother aspect of global warming that one must consider is 'Climate sensitivity.' Climate sensitivity is essentially the amount of expected change in global temperature as a result of increased retention of radiation (via GHGs). [7] Essentially, climate sensitivity tells us how much the temperature will change, given a certain amount of CO2 concentration increase [8] [10]. The reason that certain paleoclimates were not nearly as warm given the increased concentration of CO2 was due to lower climate sensitivity [9].Current studies have established an accepted measurement of modern climate sensitivity (a range between 1-4.1 degrees Celsius per doubling of CO2). This number is accepted by both supporters and skeptics of global warming [11].Furthermore, to preempt a rebuttal on the presence of water vapor concentrations, it has been observed that global humidity is increasing [12] [13].A) Carbon Cycle, atmospheric CO2, and 'Tipping the Pot'A common rebuttal against the anthropogenic climate change case is the relative smallness of man-made CO2 compared to natural concentrations. The problem with this argument, is that it observes all carbon, rather than only atmospheric CO2. Carbon that is not in the atmosphere cannot affect climate change, and does not contribute to global warming. It can be seen that man-made CO2 almost always remains in the atmosphere, as the natural equilibrium of the earths carbon cycle is upset by the introduction of artificial CO2And now in the industrial age where CO2 is introduced into the atmosphere in a myriad of ways, we can see that atmospheric CO2 levels are at a record level.Then, as GHGs warm the Earth, positive feedback loops occur. Thus, humanity has 'tipped the pot.'B) Positive FeedbackPositive feedback comes in many forms in climate change. The problem with global warming, is that said warming can result in the death of vegetation (due to droughts) and the warming of the ocean. Both of these further reduce the maximum absorption of the Earths carbon cycle, thus resulting in even more CO2 being released into the atmosphere. [14]These kinds of emissions are referred to as 'indirect emissions' as humans did not directly produce these GHG emissions, they are directly responsible for the factors that resulted in this emission. This emission also comes from other human practices, such as deforestation, and pollution of the ocean.III. What makes anthropogenic warming different from natural warming?The key difference between the current modern global warming, and previous eras of natural warming, is that the current warming period is undoubtedly the fastest in the Earth's history. 'Carbon dioxide and other global warming pollutants are collecting in the atmosphere like a thickening blanket, trapping the sun's heat and causing the planet to warm up. Although local temperatures fluctuate naturally, over the past 50 years the average global temperature has increased at the fastest rate in recorded history.' The Global scientific community has reached a 97% consensus that the current trend cannot be accounted for by natural forces. 18 scientific associations have examined and produced data on the climate, and have stated 'Observations throughout the world make it clear that climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are the primary driver.'[15][16][17][18][19][20][21]This is not an appeal to authority, as every single one of these quotes a backed by countless empirically verified, and peer reviewed studies. This is not a claim made by a single scientist, this is an overwhelming preponderance of evidence.A) Atmospheric Carbon Levels Atmospheric carbon levels, as previously mentioned, have never been this high. Record breaking levels of CO2 (a known GHG) have acted upon the Earth. Never before have atmospheric carbon levels been seen at this level. Natural CO2 cycles cannot account for this warming. Natural warming cycles of this Earth cannot account for how rapidly the earth is heating.IIII. Preponderance of evidenceThe evidence that suggest the reality of anthropogenic is, simply put, insurmountable. The weight of the evidence collected and scrutinized that points to the reality of anthropogenic global warming, when compared to the evidence presented against is like comparing the weight of a blue whale to the weight of a vole. Consider the following famous 'Powell Charts.'Peer reviewed climatology articles 1991-2012Peer reviewed studies 2013This isn't simply just scientists saying 'I think anthropogenic global warming is real!'This is thousands of experts performing countless experiments, collecting endless data that they, as experts, have critically analyzed, and have found that the data demonstrates definitively that man-made global warming exists, and is the driving force behind climate change.SummaryThere is no room in the scientific community for climate change deniersSources in comments.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank tylergraham95 for accepting this debate. I have decided to amend my debate structure a bit to fit the purpose of this debate. This round, I will post arguments for a natural cause. In the next round, I will post arguments against an anthropogenic cause. And in the final round, I will consider the most important material from both cases. The Sun The sun is the source for all the heat that the Earth receives. It is only natural to expect that fluctuations in the climate can be determined by the amount of solar activity. Unfortunately, the solar connection to climate Is not very well understood. However, there is a number of separate pieces of evidence, both direct and indirect, that indicate that the sun is the only cause of climate change on Earth. A graph of total solar irradiance is shown below:   [1] The low periods (the first one being the Maunder minimum and the second one being the Dalton minimum) correspond to documented colder periods in human history. In fact, the time of the Maunder minimum corresponded to the little ice age, when rivers that are normally ice-free froze and snow fields remained year-round at lower altitudes.[2] The correlation between solar activity and climate continued into the 20th century, and continues to this day. There are a number of methods to measure solar activity, the best one arguably being solar cycle length. Between raw solar activity (solar irradiance) and temperature, temperature lags about 7.5-10 years behind solar irradiance because of the heat capacity of the oceans. A better representation of the sun/temperature correlation is the length of the solar cycle. 'This new parameter not only indicated a remarkably high correlation coefficient between solar activity and temperature (on the order of 0.95), but it also eliminated the problem of the 7-year lag encountered by Reid.'[3] Here is a graph showing solar cycle length against temperature:   [4] The correlation between the two is striking. There is obviously correlation. Like I said before, what is not well understood is the method of causation between the two. However, we can be certain that the sun has an obvious effect on the climate, and this is shown wonderfully above. The effect of solar activity is amplified through cosmic rays. Experiments have shown that cosmic rays increase cloud cover, that increased cloud cover lowers global temperature, and that solar activity reduces the amount of cosmic rays that strike the Earth. An experiment at CERN shows the first hypothesis: “Scientists found that when shielding was removed and natural cosmic rays allowed to hit the chamber, cloud seeding increased dramatically, and it increased substantially again when additional artificial cosmic rays were added.” Experiments in the atmosphere further confirm this: “Preliminary results show that these faux cosmic rays indeed have an effect on the atmosphere: When high energy protons stream in, production of nanometer-sized particles in the atmosphere increases by more than ten times.”[5][6] It is commonly accepted that greater amounts of clouds lower global temperature, because they block some of the solar radiation. Indeed, over the past couple of decades, cloud cover has decreased.[7] As for the final hypothesis that solar activity is correlated with cosmic rays, it is known that cosmic rays come from space, and that higher solar activity means that the sun has a stronger magnetic field, and that this stronger magnetic field deflects more of the cosmic rays reaching Earth. “Over the period between 1975 and 1989, he found cosmic rays decreased by 1.2 percent annually, amplifying the sun's change in irradiance about four-fold.”[8] This graph shows both the inverse correlation between cosmic rays and low clouds and solar activity:   [9] The effect of solar activity on the climate can be partially explained by the role of ocean currents. “This [solar activity] is the single most important cause [of ocean currents and their temperatures]. The Sun provides the bulk of the energy which drives the circulation of water in the oceans, either directly or indirectly (through winds). The uneven distribution of solar energy across the globe (highest at the equator, decreasing towards the poles) produces an uneven heating of water in the ocean.”[12] The r^2 correlation between ocean current anomalies and temperature is 0.83, which is considered a good correlation, and considering ocean current's dependence on the solar cycle (which is rather similar to the 27-year solar cycle, I might add), this proves yet another piece of evidence linking solar activity with the climate.[13] Here is a graph showing ocean current anomalies compared with temperature:   [13] Another piece of evidence in favor of a solar cause to global warming is an analysis of other bodies in the solar system, for if the Earth is warming, shouldn't the other bodies in the solar system also be warming? “In 2005 data from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor and Odyssey missions revealed that the carbon dioxide 'ice caps' near Mars's south pole had been diminishing for three summers in a row. Habibullo Abdussamatov, head of space research at St. Petersburg's Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory in Russia, says the Mars data is evidence that the current global warming on Earth is being caused by changes in the sun.”[10] This is not just an isolated incident. Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Io, Europa, Ganymede, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Trition, and Pluto have all shown signs that they are warming (if I have space in my round 4 argument, I'll elaborate on this).[11] “If the Scafetta and West analysis used the uncontaminated satellite data since 1980, the results would show that the Sun has contributed at least 75% of the global warming of the last century.” And this is just a minimum estimate. If this is true (which it seems like it is considering the arguments above), the debate has already been decided. The 1500-Year Cycle In addition to cycles of interglacials and ice ages, there seems to be a 1500-year climate cycle, where the climate goes from a period of warmer temperature, to a period of colder temperature, and back again to a period of warmer temperature, the entire process taking 1500 years to repeat. Where do these cycles come from? There's no 1500 year solar cycle. However, there are 87 and 210 solar cycles, and superimposing the two cycles produces the 1500 year cycle.[14] This graph shows the most recent 1500-year cycle:   Many of the previous warmings (the Minoan warming, Roman warming, and Medieval warming), were as warm, if not warmer than the current climate. This, combined with the correlation evidence between solar activity and the climate, indicates that the current episode of global warming is nothing more than another cycle of the 1500-year cycle. There are numerous pieces of evidence for each of these warmings, as well as illustrations of the cycle. One such piece of evidence is, “The scientists found evidence that on average, every 1,470 years, plus or minus 500 years, cold, ice-bearing waters, which today circulate around southern Greenland, pushed as far south as Great Britain.”[8] There seems to be a full cycle of up-down-up temperatures of the climate every 1470 years. And this goes as far back as at least 1 million years ago. Currently, we are in an upswing of temperatures, just coming off of the Little Ice Age, the peak to be in a few hundred years, making the peak-to-peak difference between today's global warming and the Medieval Warm Period a little less than 1500 years. So today's Global Warming is a natural, cyclical occurrence. Conclusion Global warming is caused by an increase in solar activity. There is both correlation and causation between solar activity and global temperature. The sun's effects on cosmic rays amplify the correlation, and the ocean current's cycles and correlation with temperature back up the idea. This hypothesis is backed up further by evidence that other bodies in the solar system are warming. The climate of the Earth fluctuates in 1500-year cycles, that correspond to a superposition of solar cycles. The Sun has been more active in the last 100 years than in the last 500, and this is exemplified in the fact that we are going through a warm period. There's perfectly good reason to suppose that the current warming, similar to all the other previous warmings in magnitude and initial conditions (solar activity) was caused by the sun. In the next round, I will present arguments against an anthropogenic cause to global warming.</t>
<h>   Another piece of evidence in favor of a solar cause to global warming is an analysis of other bodies in the solar system, for if the Earth is warming, shouldn't the other bodies in the solar system also be warming?</h>

    <t>Thanks again to Subutai for allowing me to take on this challenge! I've enjoyed the debate we've had throroughly.For this round, I will go through my opponents rebuttalls, and defend my case against them, and then make my closing statements.A) CO2 Lag in temperature changesSo the first problem we should address with this rebuttal is that it implies that I am trying to prove that GHGs are the driving force behind all forms of climate change. This is not the case. Climate shift, historically, has been/can be driven by several factors, usually multiple acting at once. What I can and have proven, though, is that CO2 and other GHGs have been a factor in the majority of climate shifts, historically, and that modern global warming can be explained only by the increase of atmospheric CO2 due to anthropogenic influences.So, let's examine my opponents source number 2 for round 3. He attempts to demonstrate that CO2 increases have lagged warming, and therefore  CO2 cannot be the cause of modern warming. This is not so. In fact, the very source he cited (source 2 round 3 [1]) states that though the warming may have been initiated by another factor in climate shift, the sudden increase of CO2 from positive feedback amplified the warming effect massively.This is corroborated by cross-reference with my arguments regarding the phanerzoic era, and positive feedback loops in CO2 release. 'When the Earth comes out of an ice age, the warming is not initiated by CO2 but by changes in the Earth's orbit. The warming causes the oceans to release CO2. TheCO2 amplifies the warming and mixes through the atmosphere, spreading warming throughout the planet. So CO2 causes warming AND rising temperature causes CO2rise.  Overall, about 90% of the global warming occurs after the CO2 increase.' [2] 'If you actually read the papers, which claim there to be a lag, they almost all note how CO2 acts as an amplifier and how the results do not contradict AGW. There is new research (Shakun et al.), which argued that CO2 preceded the end of the last ice age, and may have (in part) led to the warm interglacial in which we live today. The following graph from the study demonstrates how CO2 may have been an important factor in the most recent deglaciation:' [3] The truth is that sometimes small amounts of warming are intitiated, and then CO2 release into the atmosphere causes massive warming. This can be misconstrued to say that other forms of climate forcing could be present, but analysis of paleoclimate data, and the factors that are forcing the climate currently, it can be seen that Anthropogenic CO2 release can be the only explanatory factor of modern global warming, despite CO2 lag. [4][5][6][7][8]B) Troposphere climate data.The rebuttal to this argument is simple. The data my opponent cites is, simply, incorrect. 'Satellite measurements do show warming in the Tropsphere when a cooling bias from the Stratosphere is removed. Warming trends agree well with surface temperatures and model predictions except near the Poles. Differences between various analyses are largely due to analysis techniques and compensations for satellite data issues.' [9]The data displayed, though not cited, by my opponent is based largely on Spencer and Christy 1992, which used collection methods that have since been significantly improved upon, and the modern satallite data collected shows us that the earth as a whole is indeed warming. [10] C) South Pole is cooling.Again, this is a false leap my opponent is begging you to make. He claims that ice is increasing in the south pole, and then states that it is therefore cooling. Cooling is not indicitive of increased ice formation. That is simply not true. The southern ocean has recorded to be warming. [11]The increase in ice anomaly is due only to a complex mixture of changing currents (brought on by global warming) and the hole in the ozone layer. [12][13]D) CO2 is saturatedThis argument is fairly weak, as the myth that CO2 saturation can occur has been debunked. The opposite has been conclusively proven with empiric evidence. The idea that CO2 saturation can occur is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the way that the greenhouse effect occurs. 'This argument originates from Angstrom's work in 1901. We now know that the planetary energy balance is determined by the upper levels of the troposphere and that the saturation of the absorption at the central frequency does not preclude the possibility to absorb more energy.' [14]The argument that my opponent is making is ancient (over 100 years old) and has since been debunked, as the modern atmospheric warming model now accounts for the simple force of convection. Essentially, this argues that the CO2 is in the atmosphere to absorb extra heat from the sun and heat the Earth. That is not how a greenhouse works, or how the greenhouse effect occurs. When a greenhouse is heated, the glass then keeps the hot air from escaping, which causes warming. The same goes for CO2. The earth is heated, and then releases this energy in the form of black body radiation. Increased CO2 concentrations prevents this radiation from escaping at the proper rate.E) Troposphere hot-spotThis counterpoint my opponent has made is going to follow the pattern that his counter-case has followed thus far. His case is based on data that has been collected incorrectly, and proven to have been collected incorrectly. Essentially, my opponent (through no fault of his own) is citing data and sources that are patently false, and lend no water to his case.'Satellite measurements match model results apart from in the tropics. There isuncertainty with the tropic data due to how various teams correct for satellite drift. The U.S. Climate Change Science Program conclude the discrepancy is most likely due to data errors.' [15] Improved data collection has shown that the data cited by my opponent was mired with error, and that improved data collection methods demonstrate a hotspot. [16][17][18]The 'Consensus'My opponent, for whatever reason, decides to attack the recent media reports on the 'scientific consensus' on AGW. I never cited a consensus, rather I only cited thousands of empiric studies with empiric evidence in support of AGW, and asked the voters to weigh these sources against the one single report published in conflict with AGW. A concensus is apparent though, but it I do not argue that the science is clear because there is a consensus. I argue that there is a concensus because the science is clear. By my opponents line of logic, we ought to deny scientific consensus due to the rare occasion where a consensus is totally false, but this is not proper logic. The truth is when a consensus is reached in the sceintific community (post scientific revolution/enlightenment era) that the consensus is right nearly 99.999% of the time! No we shouldn't accept something as the absolute and gospel truth just because there is a consensus, but in the face of overwhelming data and testimony from experts, versus sparse data from a splinter group of deniers, the only logical and reasonable belief to side with is that of the overwhelming evidence and expertise.Therefore, you must vote CON!Sources in comments</t>
<h>    This is not so. In fact, the very source he cited states that though the warming may have been initiated by another factor in climate shift, the sudden increase of CO2 from positive feedback amplified the warming effect massively.</h>

    <t>Just going to do a quick line by line.  ' Without technology, mankind would still be considered as animals trapped on a planet, unarmed and unfit to fight for survival and unable to complete even the simplest tasks. Therefore, technology brings more good than harm.'  There is literally 200,000 years of human existence and survival happened just fine before anything you'd consider technology even existed. Humans can survive on very little as evidenced by are ancestors doing it for at least 180,000 years.  'Even though mankind uses technology for some disadvantages, technology must and can be used to surpass all conflicts between one another, maintain peace throughout the globe, as the essential tool for survival, help all living creatures in the state of evolution, and teaches us the true meaning of hope'  On the contrary. Technology has made conflict easier. We can send planes across the globe to kill enemies we wouldn't even have if it weren't for us being so interconnected because of technology.  When you consider that because the world is so connected diseases like Ebola can spread across the globe faster and easier, meaning a plague could more easily destroy the worl, we have enough nukes where if we were to go to war with another nuclear powered country we could end all life on Earth.  Technology isn't our savior. It is in fact enslaving us like my last round showed and may even be the thing that wipes humanity of the face of the Earth.  'inescapable in our lives and has proved essential to mankind. Therefore, it is conclusive that humans and animals needs technology'  That's irrelevant to the resolution. The question posed is 'does it do more harm than Good', which it most certainly does not 'Is it essential for survival', which is debatable.  'Your first point ,which stated global warming was caused by technology, is in fact a probability, not conclusive. Even if technology caused the occurrence of global warming, global warming can be overcome by technology  I gave evidence to support that conclusion and you've merely asserted it's not true instead of addressing my arguments. My arguments stand and I extend them.  'One day, our societies will replace everything that pollutes to things that doesn't, from cars that runs by petrol to cars that runs by solar energy, from burning fossils to generating wing energy and many other.'  speculation, nothing to support these beliefs. This is just a bare assertion at it's finest. The trend is more pollution and global warming and I see no evidence of those trends stopping. Even so, without technology to start with global warming wouldn't be a problem.  I gave evidence for how autonomy was destroyed under my section entitled 'harm to humans'. I've shown billions of animals tortured and bad drinking water. The best pro does is show how these things can be mitigated with technology but these things are harmful no matter what</t>

    <t>Thank you for your participation in this debate.  As I have mentioned earlier, I have stated that technology is crucial to the survival of all living creatures. Technology is inescapable in our lives and has proved essential to mankind. Therefore, it is conclusive that humans and animals needs technology. Next, I will point out the faults in your points.  Your first point ,which stated global warming was caused by technology, is in fact a probability, not conclusive. Even if technology caused the occurrence of global warming, global warming can be overcome by technology. How so? Well, technology has changed when it began entering the new era of clean and sufficient energy. As we all know, scientists of today have invented solar panels and wind turbines, that supplies us clean energies, which doesn't pollutes. One day, our societies will replace everything that pollutes to things that doesn't, from cars that runs by petrol to cars that runs by solar energy, from burning fossils to generating wing energy and many other.  Besides that, you stated that many people does not have access to safe drinking water, but do you know that's a company in Switzerland invented a water filter, called the LifeStraw. It is an excellent example that technology can overcome any problems and make it better. Other than that, it is normal for humans to have farm animals as they are food to us. As your point, you said that animals were treated badly. However, little did you know, there are also animal sanctuaries and forest reserves to protect them in their natural habitats. When technology gets better, our civilizations stays in a stable position resulting mankind to be capable of compassion. That way, we get to do more than just survive, we'll be able to help others in survival, and maybe more.  Moreover, technology will never control us as technology is a part of us ever since the dawn of mankind. We earn our living with technology as our stepping stone for success and use technology to maintain peace and order. Without technology, there will be chaos and our society will never be suitable for our future generations to grow in.  Lastly, there are no evidence referring that the loss of the human autonomy was actually caused by the superior rise of technology. In fact, there are no relation between these two things. The information you gave merely explain the definition of autonomy, not how these two things relate.  In conclusion, technology can and will bring us more good than harm, and bring us hope rather than chaos.</t>

    <t>Harms caused by technology-  Damages to the environment.   A. Technology is the main factor behind global warming. We know that global warming is man made and a result of the industrial-technological revolution is because of the amount of low isotope carbon-14 found in the atmosphere. Something that mainly comes from burning fossil fuels. B. More then 14,000 people die from drinking polluted water every day [1]. Nearly half a billion people do not have access to safe drinking water [2]. I've only mentioned the human element so far. This pollution is also causing extremely harmful affects on underwater ecosystems as well. The sources of this harmful phenomenon is mostly human caused and as a result of technology. If you look at the sources of water pollution in the cited article you will come to the same conclusion [3]. Harm of the industrial-technological society on Animals.  Factory farming has reduced animals to mere cogs in the machine. Animals are out in cages that are extremely crowded . They live their whole lives barely able to move. [1] They are on many occasions force fed in a way that causes extreme damage and pain. This is just a short list of the abuse these animals take to feed the industrial-technological system. Harmful affects to humans  It's not just animals who are reduced to mere cogs in the technological society. Humans have almost lost all autonomy. We have been reduced to wage slave . Are movement is extremely controlled. We must walk on the side walk follow green lights, stop at red ones.Psychological affects on humans.  Humans have a great need for the feeling of autonomy [1]. People have fought and died for their right to have autonomy. Often when people are suffering depression they claim to feel like they have no control over the direction of their life. Autonomy is an innate human desire that isn't going away despite the fact the more the technological beast grows the more us humans lose our autonomy. CONCLUSION  Technology is destroying the environment and our freedom. Vote Con.</t>

    <t>Technology, is used around the globe, from the invention of wheels to the futuristic Google glasses. To indicate whether technology does more harm or more good, I will list out points on why technology does more good than harm.  First of all, technology can bring us one step forward towards a much better future. Technology is created ever since the existence of mankind during the prehistoric times to ease mankind in completing any difficult tasks and to expand the horizon of the impossible. Most importantly, technology is used in many ways, such as to bring mankind into deep space, discover new resources, create new cures for various diseases, and many more. Without technology, mankind would still be considered as animals trapped on a planet, unarmed and unfit to fight for survival and unable to complete even the simplest tasks. Therefore, technology brings more good than harm.  Other than that, technology is needed for survival. Mammals, such as West African chimpanzees and Brazilian capuchin monkeys, uses technology in the form of stone hammers and anvils to crack nuts for food. Besides that, beavers make dams and bees make honeycombs. These are examples of the importance of technology. Without technology, survival is a challenge for both mankind and animals. Therefore, technology is essential for survival.  Even though mankind uses technology for some disadvantages, technology must and can be used to surpass all conflicts between one another, maintain peace throughout the globe, as the essential tool for survival, help all living creatures in the state of evolution, and teaches us the true meaning of hope...</t>

    <t>Thank you Mikal, Bluesteel, and 16kadam. I want to establish, first, that this isn't a debate about Global Warming, but about Man-Made Global Warming. To prove his case, Pro must establish that Man-Made Global Warming is the threat. If he establishes that Global Warming is a threat, but can not establish that enough of it is man-made to say the threat comes from man, he can not affirm the resolution.Contention 1: Human caused Global Warming Exists.  Many Global Warming advocates state that CO2 levels are skyrocketing, but that is incorrect. I give you the above graph measuring the past 600 million years of CO2 levels, which shows we are actually at an all time low. Now the website I got this from no longer has this page up so I apologize. We can see from observance of this graph that, with us being at an all time CO2 lows, that we are nowhere close to meeting the impact that my opponent brings up. The world has had CO2 levels over 5,000 ppm, while are now currently around apprx. 350 ppm CO2 levels.  The above graph shows that comparisons of C13 (Carbon isotope) and this shows that there is little to no trend in many of these as the average is zero while the trend for all of these are zero (1). This is important as the Carbon isotope is important in measuring this so called 'Global Warming.'  This chart above shows the CO2 and Earth's temperatures for the past 600 million years. My opponent's claims are incorrect as we have had absurd levels of CO2 and let the Global Temperature never reached the extreme levels needed to prove causation on the level Pro must prove (2). Now I will move on to how Earth is actually cooling and how it's temperature is cooler than it has been.If we observe the above graph we can see that Earth has been a whole lot hotter than where we currently are to the point where the Earth's average temperature is been 7.5 °C hotter than it currently it is. You can also see that in the span of the past 10,000 years the temperature has leveled off, but you may ask yourself where does that place us in the lights of modern day?  I am going to cite Dr. Done Easterbrook, who is a climate scientist. Back in 2000 he predicted that Earth was entering a cooling phase. He predicts that for the next 20 years Earth will cool by 3/10 degree each year and that we are going to enter another little Ice Age like we did from 1650 and 1790 (3). While the IPCC, the people Pro quoted, has been wrong since just before the 2000’s, while the Earth has cooled, as Dr. Done predicted.1) Contention 2: Future Harm and sea levels. Many Warming Scientists claim that the sea level rise is due to the Arctic melting, but this is false. Al Gore stated that the Arctic Ice would be completely melted by 2014, but he is incorrect then and now.  Jan. 6, 2012: The Coast Guard Cutter Healy breaks ice around the Russian-flagged tanker Renda 250 miles south of Nome. The Healy is the Coast Guard’s only currently operating polar icebreaker. The vessels are transiting through ice up to five-feet thick in this area. The 370-foot tanker Renda will have to go through more than 300 miles of sea ice to get to Nome, a city of about 3,500 people on the western Alaska coastline that did not get its last pre-winter fuel delivery because of a massive storm (4). Let's go back to 2007-2008 and see if his claim was justified in the Arctic Ice activity.  It seems that he is incorrect, but let's look further into the near past. How about 2012-2013? (5) We all remember the Climate Scientists that got stuck in Arctic Ice Earlier this year correct? Then a Russian Ice Breaker tried to free them, but got stuck. Can you guess what they were studying? They had predicted that all the Arctic Ice had melted due to Global Warming and that Earth would get flooded massively. Boy were they wrong (6).  (7) Dr. Koonin, former head of the Department of Energy under President Obama, has stated that Global Warming is not certain. This is because he has found 3 things wrong and highly incorrect about the theory. 1. Shrinking of Arctic Sea ice doesn't account for the gaining of the Antarctic ice. 2. Earth's temperature today is the same as it was 30 years ago. 3. The sea levels rose at the same height and rate in the 20th century. (8) Here is another correlation that must happen. If the Ice Caps are completely melted as Pro claims then the sea level would have risen completely drowning tons of land.  The graph above is raw satellite image data of the sea level rise over an 8 year period showing that there is little to no change in the Sea Levels rising (9). The sea level rises, on average, about 3 inches per century and it has been found to not even been rising at all.  This graph is the sea levels off the cost of French Guyana which is one of the areas which is predicted to be flooded due to Global Warming, but as you can see by the graph (which goes to 2008) the sea level is currently on a downward trend. Contention 3 - The Benefits of a Warm Climate A moderately warm period is better than a cold period. If the temperature is not too warm, a warm climate can have positive effects on both the Earth as a whole and on everyone. A. Health Effects In moderation, warm temperatures are better for the body than cold temperatures. People cannot get enough heat, infections are rampant, and hospital admissions will rise in the cold. From 1979 to 1997, extreme cold killed roughly twice as many Americans as heat waves [coincidentally when the Earth was heating up]. In Germany, heat waves were found to reduce overall mortality rates slightly, while cold spells led to a significant increase in deaths. In addition, warmer weather decreases incidences of strokes, respiratory diseases, and the flu.[1] In general, life expectancies are higher in warmer climates, and there are fewer incidences of disease and other health problems. A warm period would be beneficial to human health. B. Economic Benefits Some of the major industrial sectors, particularly agriculture, tend to work better in a warmer environment than they do in a cooler environment. 'The book [The Impact of Climate Change] finds that a moderate warming will have a positive economic impact on the agriculture and forestry sectors. Since carbon dioxide is used by plants to capture and store energy, there may be a fertilizing effect as levels of the gas rise. This, combined with longer growing seasons, fewer frosts and more precipitation, among other factors, could benefit some economic sectors.'[2] CO2 increases, a byproduct of temperature increases ([1]), naturally help to stimulate plant growth as well, further helping agriculture. 'For a 300 ppm increase in the atmosphere's CO2 concentration above the planet's current base level of slightly less than 400 ppm, for example, the productivity of earth's herbaceous plants rises by something on the order of 30%, while the productivity of its woody plants rises by something on the order of 50%.'[3][4] This further helps humans by increasing food yields, lowering rates of starvation and hunger. 1) Singer, S. Fred, and Dennis T. Avery: 'Unstoppable Global Warming: Every 1,500 Years.' 2) Contention 3 - The Effects of CO2 Even if Pro were to establish that Global Warming is a threat, he must establish that humans cause a substantial deal of Global Warming before they can establish that Man-made Global Warming is a threat. The main case that Global Warming activists have to prove Man-Made Global Warming is a large part of the picture is the CO2 argument. it doesn’t, however, stand to fact. Carbon Dioxide is, in fact, very weak. Having only a Global Warming Potential of 1. Carbon Dioxide makes up a grand total of 3.618% of the total Gas House Effect, with water vapor making up 95% (1). Carbon Dioxide's number increased from 295 ppm to 400 ppm, an increase of 105 ppm, equal to 49.29 gigatons (1 Gigaton of CO2 is worth 2.13 ppm (2)). Since 1 gigaton of CO2 is worth 0.004% of total Greenhouse Effect, 49.29 gigatons is worth an additional 0.21% (2). We can see the weakness of CO2 in the chart below. If human's did raise CO2 levels by 105 ppm, the effect on the climate would be pathetic. People gravely exaggerate the effect of CO2 on the climate. The chart of Global Warming gases is as follows: GAS -- GREENHOUSE EFFECT -- HUMAN EFFECT Water Vapor ------ 95.000% -- 0.001% Carbon Dioxide -- 3.618% ---- 0.117% Methane ------------ 0.360 ------ 0.066% Nitrous oxide ----- 0.950% ---- 0.047% Misc ------------------- 0.072% ---- 0.047% Total ------------------ 100% ------- 0.278% Following the graph, we can assume correctly that human’s CO2 emissions add very little, if almost anything at all, to Global Warming. If the man-made portion of Global Warming (0.21% of the total) was a threat, than we’d been dead from the natural Global Warming (99.79% of total) long ago. At 0.21%, the rise in temperature from our contribution would be so small that the difference in temperature from Spring to Summer would be greater.</t>

    <t>== Framework ==  For something to be a threat, there only needs to be a reasonable probability that it can cause harm in the future. In contrast, to show that a threat to the environment does not exist, our opponent’s must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there is no possibility that human-caused climate change can cause harm in the future. Our opponent’s burden comes, in part, from the precautionary principle, which holds that we should not take any actions that fundamentally alter our ecosystem (such as emitting large amounts of CO2) unless we are absolutely certain that there will not be problematic consequences to doing so in the long-term. The justification for the precautionary principle is that environmental harm is irreversible and the long-term effects are hard to predict, so we should be extremely certain that our actions will not cause harm before fundamentally altering our ecosystem.  == Case ==  Contention 1: Human-caused global warming exists  The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is an international group of some of the world’s most respected scientists. The IPCC has published five different reports on climate change. With each subsequent generation of report, the reports get more accurate because more datasets become available.  First, warming is happening now. According to the IPCC’s fifth report on climate change: 'Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and oceans have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen, and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased.' 'It is virtually certain that globally the troposphere has warmed since the mid-20th century.' [IPCC 5] The IPCC defines 'virtually certain' as having a 99-100% confidence level. [IPCC 5] The IPCC also says it is virtually certain that we will have more hots days and fewer cold days over major land areas in the future. [IPCC 5] The IPCC says that it is virtually certain that increased cyclone activity is caused by global warming. [IPCC 5] 'It is virtually certain that the upper ocean (0-700 m) warmed from 1971 to 2010.' [IPCC 5] The IPCC says that it is virtually certain that permafrost levels will continue to decline due to global warming. [IPCC 5] 'It is virtually certain that global mean sea level rise will continue beyond 2100' due to global warming. [IPCC 5] The IPCC report also contains numerous findings that are 'very likely' (90-100% confidence level), but for the sake of saving space, we won't excerpt them here.  Second, recent warming is caused by human activity. 'The evidence for human influence has grown since [the previous IPCC report]. It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.' [IPCC 5] 'Extremely likely' is a 95-100% confidence interval. [IPCC 5] Today’s atmospheric CO2 levels are 40 percent higher than the highest natural level of CO2 that has ever existed in the last 800,000 years. We know that most of the increase in CO2 levels is due to burning coal and gasoline because the composition of the CO2 has a unique fingerprint that allows scientists to determine its source. [EDF] Another human activity that has increased CO2 levels is the massive clear cutting of the rainforests, which formerly acted as a huge carbon sink, absorbing large amounts of CO2. [EDF] Deforestation adds 1,500,000,000,000,000 grams of carbon to the atmosphere each year. Thus, humans contribute greatly to global warming.  The data proving that human-caused global warming exists has become so overwhelming that it has converted former climate skeptics, such as University of California, Berkeley, professor Richard Muller. Muller writes: “'Call me a converted skeptic. Three years ago I identified problems in previous climate studies that, in my mind, threw doubt on the very existence of global warming. Last year, following an intensive research effort involving a dozen scientists, I concluded that global warming was real and that the prior estimates of the rate of warming were correct. I’m now going a step further: Humans are almost entirely the cause. [New data from UC Berkeley] show[s] that the average temperature of the earth’s land has risen by two and a half degrees Fahrenheit over the past 250 years, including an increase of one and a half degrees over the most recent 50 years. Moreover, it appears likely that essentially all of this increase results from the human emission of greenhouse gases. [The UC Berkeley data set is] stronger than those of [previous IPCC reports].' Third, there is significant evidence in the paleoclimatic record that greenhouse gasses have a significant effect on the global temperature. Over the Cenozoic Era, which began about 66 million years ago, we can see a clear greenhouse induced warming effect within the various warming and cooling cycles. It remains very clear that CO2 remains the main driver of climate in this period. The large climate changes over the period cannot result from shifts in the climate system, but depend on both energy coming into the planet (e.g. solar rays) and changes in the atmosphere (greenhouse gasses). The sun, however, cannot be considered the dominant force of climate change in this time period because the luminosity increased by about 0.4% over this period. That alone cannot explain the warming during the Cenozoic because the Cenozoic has also seen a period of decreasing temperatures, which could only be explained by fluctuating CO2 levels (from 1000 ppm at the beginning of the Cenozoic to a low of 170 ppm). If the sun was responsible for the warming during this period, we’d see only a constant increase in temperatures. Continental movement also is unlikely as an explanation for the observed climate change during this period due to the fact that “most continents were near their present latitudes at the beginning of the Cenozoic.” Studies have concluded that “CO2 was the dominant climate forcing in the Cenozoic”. Contention 2: Future harm from global warming  By 2100, global warming is estimated to cause $1.9 trillion per year in economic damages to the United States. The damage includes $360 billion from destroyed real estate due to rising sea levels, $141 billion in higher energy costs due to higher demand for air conditioning, $950 billion due to the cost of providing water to places where it dries up, and $422 billion in damages from the increase in tropical storms due to global warming. [NRDC]  Future sea level rise, even by conservative estimates, are significant and would threaten “some coastal cities and low-lying island nations.” The low estimates--assuming less than 2 degrees celsius warming and a decreased temperature trend after 1950--find that there will be about half a meter sea level rise by the year 2100. Food production, important to the well being of society, also represents a large industry: about $200 billion a year to the US economy. Agriculture is dependent upon certain climatic conditions and altering these could prove to be catastrophic. While an initial increase in temperature may help some crops, once temperatures pass the crop’s optimal levels for growth and reproduction, increased warming becomes counterproductive. Some crops, like grains, grow faster when the climate is warmer, but because these crops grow faster, they have less time to fully mature, so they produce fewer edible byproducts. [EPA] Further, weeds thrive in warmer climates with more CO2 enrichments. Farmers already spend $11 billion a year combating weeds. Future temperature increases would add another burden to the industry [EPA]. Lastly, climate change dries out and acidifies soil, further impacting food production. Many theoretical models exist claiming that certain diseases would become more common as the climate changes. For example, increased temperatures will allow the virus that causes dengue fever to survive in more places. In 1990, 30% of the world’s population lived in regions where the estimated risk of dengue fever transmission was 50%. By 2085, 5-6 billion people (about half of the future estimated population) would live in areas where they were at risk of dengue transmission. If climate changes do not occur, only 35% of the population would be at risk. Conclusion As you can see from our prior contentions, man made global warming is in fact a threat and can cause a great deal of harm. Even if Con casts some doubt on the harm caused by global warming, as long as we win that some harm is probable, we win this debate. Almost any amount of harm is enough for you as the judge to affirm the resolution that global warming is a threat. For the Con team to win this debate they must negate all of our contentions and statistics along with building a case of their own showing that there is in fact no threat from global warming. We can clearly see from the prior contentions that there is indeed a threat and it can and will cause harm.</t>

    <t>I apologize to all - Lannan wrote the first two contentions in the last argument, but he can’t present refutations this round due to time conflictions. I (Subutai) will do my best to address Mikal’s concerns, but I will take liberties in presenting arguments that will deviate from what Lannan wrote. I also only have about an hour left, so I also apologize if anything looks sloppy. Contention 1 - Anthropogenic Global Warming There seems to be some disagreement between the different people writing the different arguments. I am simply going to show three reasons why an anthropogenic cause is unlikely. First, according to the greenhouse effect, global warming should be starting from the lower atmosphere and moved to the surface (because the CO2 collects in the upper troposphere first). However, this is not happening. '...satellite and high-altitude balloon data confirm that the lower atmosphere is not trapping lots of additional heat due to higher CO2 concentrations. It is hard to know how fast the Earth's highly variable surface is warming, but it is warming faster than the lower atmosphere where the CO2 is accumulating. This is strong evidence that CO2 is not the primary climate factor.'[1] Here is a graph showing how the surface has warmed more than the troposphere:   Second, current levels of CO2 have very little effect on temperature. The greenhouse effect certainly exists, but it doesn't become linearly stronger with increasing amounts of CO2. CO2's effect on temperature is logarithmic, meaning that each additional increase has a smaller effect on the climate than the last. 'The carbon that is already up in the atmosphere absorbs most of the light it can. CO2 only soaks up its favorite wavelengths of light and it's close to its saturation point. It manages to grab a bit more light from wavelengths that are close to its favorite bands but it can't do much more, because there are not many left-over photons at the right wavelengths.'[2][3] This chart shows approximately the effect that each additional increment of CO2 increase has on temperature:   Note how the pre-industrial to modern level increase has had less than a 0.2 C increase in temperature. Third and most importantly, the predicted 'hot-spot' 10 miles above the tropics that would be a signature of CO2-induced global warming is absent. 'The computer models show that greenhouse warming will cause a hot-spot at an altitude between 8 and 12 km over the tropics between 30 N and 30 S. The temperature at this hot-spot is projected to increase at a rate of two to three times faster than at the surface. However, the Hadley Centre's real-world plot of radiosonde temperature observations shown below does not show the projected CO2 induced global warming hot-spot at all. The predicted hot-spot is entirely absent from the observational record. This shows that atmosphere warming theory programmed into climate models are wrong.'[2] Here is the plot of predicted temperature changes due to CO2:  However, here is the actual observed temperature changes:    The hot spot is completely missing, which is pretty much a knockout blow to the anthropogenic global warming theory. And to be fair to Easterbrook, the IPCC isn’t very good at predicting the climate either: The climate seems to have a mind of its own that we haven’t deciphered yet. However, it looks very unlikely that anthropogenic causes are behind the recent global warming. [1]: Singer, S. Fred, and Dennis T. Avery: Unstoppable Global Warming: Every 1,500 Years. Contention 2 - Sea Level Rise Even though some groups like to show scenes of global apocalypse with this, the truth is that the sea level hasn’t risen that much. However, both past and predicted rise have been greatly exaggerated. The linear trend shows a sea level rise of only 1.31 +/- 0.30 mm/year. 'The Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory estimates the rate of sea level rise at 1.42 plus or minus 0.14 mm/year for the period 1954 to 2003. This is less than the estimate of 1.91 plus or minus 0.14 mm/year for the period 1902 to 1953, indicating a slowing of the rate.' That’s an increase of around 2.8 inches in the last 50 years – not that much of an apocalyptic scenario.[1][2]  Future sea level predictions are even better. As of currently, global ocean heat content has not changed in recent years. Sea level itself has actually been declining for the last decade.    “The ‘INQUA Commission on Sea-Level Change and Coastal Evolution’ led by Dr. Morner, prepared as estimate that the global sea level will rise 10 cm plus or minus 10 cm in the next 100 years. Dr. Morner has since revised his estimate to 5 cm per 100 years after considering data of the Sun activity suggesting that the warming trend may have ended and the Earth may be headed into a cooling trend.” That’s around 2.5 inches in the next 100 years. That’s really not too bad.[2][3] As for Tuvalu, sea level has actually dropped four inches in the last 20 years and there is no evidence based on the observations that sea level rise there is accelerating.[4] In general, there is no cause for concern here. Contention 3 - Benefits of Global Warming If we take the rest of our argument (take, for example, global warming), we see that the potential threats of global warming are only exaggerated, if not unimportant. This contention is built upon the previous arguments.  A - Health Benefits If the flu is correlated to heat, then why is the flu worse during the winter months? In fact, the virus dies quicker in warmer weather than colder weather. The Plague of Justinian was partially caused by a colder climate.[1] As for deaths from heat and cold, 'The only global study suggests that this is true internationally: by 2050, there will be almost 400,000 more heat-related deaths a year, and almost 1.8 million fewer cold-related deaths. Warmer temperatures will save 1.4 million lives each year. The number of saved lives will outweigh the increase in heat-related deaths until at least 2200.'[2] Yes, while it is easier to make fire than an air conditioner, heat is, overall, better for the body than cold (to a point). People in the Middle East are healthier (when controlled, that is) than people in, say, Siberia. What my opponent cites is not an increase in deaths from warming per se, but in temperature variability: 'The claim that warming increases morbidity rates is a myth. This isn't the case, according to Dr. Robert Mendelsohn, an environmental economist from Yale University. Mendelsohn argues that heat-stress deaths are caused by temperature variability and not warming. Those deaths grow in number not as climates warm but as the variability in climate increases.'[3]  B - Economic Benefits There’s no reason, beyond the most apocalyptic of models that the warming would be so bad that plants would be severely affected beyond what they can handle. Plus, you never responded to my claim that CO2 helps crops. [1]. Contention IV: The Effects of CO2. Pro is playing with words here. The idea of a threat isn’t that it’s kinda not okay, but that it is in fact an issue. A paper cut isn’t a threat, but a knife cut to the artery is. Pro must establish that Man-Made Global Warming is an actual issue that could harm0 us, not that it’s just not good. As for the term Man-Made Global Warming, it refers to the topic as it is or is likely to become. Not what it would be in an unlikely scenario. If human’s contribution to Global Warming, as it is or might be, isn’t large enough to justify being called a threat, than Pro has not affirmed the Resolution. Regarding CO2 causing temperatures to rise enough to cause enough evaporation… This is an extreme case of slippery slope. It gravely assumes CO2 will cause that kind of increase in Water Vapor. Water Vapor is very weak. The increase in tempature needed to give Water Vapor the quantity to affirm the resolution is nearly unreachable.I’ve already established how weak CO2 is. It would take unimaginable amounts of it to cause such an increase in Global Warming. Pro’s argument is so often quoted, but it’s simply improbable. Unless Pro can establish that Man-Made CO2 has enough of an effect to start that cycle, he can’t prove such a slippery slope. Another flaw in Pro’s argument is that it’s ignorant of historic records. Let’s look at history... CO2 ppm is at 400 right now, but in the Mesozoic period and Cambrian Perios, it reached 2000-4000 and 7000 ppm.(5) At 7000 ppm, the temperatures were only 10ºc higher than today. Proportionately, temperatures should have been 54.23ºc higher than now. This empathizes how little of an impact CO2 has on the global temperature.  With how weak CO2 is, it would take insane quantities to accomplish what Pro claims it will. But even at 7000 ppm, it was unable to increase the temperature enough to support Pro’s case, especially if water evaporation was enough to escalate it. More evidence of the weakness of CO2 can be found in the current Global Warming Cycle. Pro shows a CO2 chart of the past 10,000 years... Here is a chart of the CO2 levels and Global Warming level from the past 400,000 years.  As we can see, despite the abnormal CO2 presence, temperatures today are actually the lowest in the past 400k years of Global Warming cycles, which are common and completely natural. Despite Pro’s claim, CO2 simply does not have the necessary effects. It may follow warmer temperatures, but warming temperatures do not follow it. When temperatures rise, CO2 rises, but when we see CO2 rise, temperatures don’t rise with it. Historically, and even now, CO2 does not bring forth the effects needed to prove it has a substantial effect on warming. Or that it’s effect is large enough to cause temperatures to rise enough to increase Water Vapor.</t>

    <t>R1) Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) ExistsRight from the start we can see a lot of errors from Con’s opening arguments and graphs. The first thing we want to note is that Con’s first graph about atmospheric CO2 levels is extremely misleading. Although Con doesn’t source it, Con’s graph comes from a study by Robert Berner. There are HUGE uncertainties in Berner’s guesses as to what CO2 levels were hundreds of millions of years ago. You can see in the chart below that the range of error is huge. Also Berner himself said that the “exact values of CO2 [in his report] should not be taken literally.” Berner’s guess-work therefore cannot be cited as the actual values for CO2 levels in the past.  Second, the sun was so much dimmer hundreds of millions of years ago that higher CO2 levels were needed just to prevent the Earth from freezing over. (During this period, the sun “would have been several percent dimmer according to established nuclear models of main sequence stars . . .  with a dimmer sun, high CO2 is necessary to stop the Earth freezing over.”) [SkS1] Berner even said, compensating for all the factors that were different in the past, “over the long term there is indeed a correlation between CO2 and paleotemperature”. Third, you can see that over the past 10,000 years, CO2 levels today are at an all time high. CO2 has risen exponentially since the start of the industrial revolution. Unlike over a time scale of millions of years, the luminosity of the sun has been relatively constant over the last 10,000 years, so the only factor that has changed has been CO2 levels. Therefore, the only factor that can explain the temperature increase over the last 10,000 years is CO2. Fourth, Con is blatantly wrong. The greenhouse effect is obviously a real effect that is acknowledged by every scientist in the world. When you walk into a hot car or an actual greenhouse, it has heated up so quickly because of the CO2 in the car or greenhouse. It is impossible to assert that CO2 levels have *no* effect on temperature. The following chart shows the correlation between CO2 and temperature over the last 500 million years. The dotted line is CO2 and temperature is the solid line. The study also concludes that if you look at the luminosity of the sun alone, without accounting for CO2 levels, luminosity alone *fails* to explain temperature fluctuations. Our opponents next cite Don Easterbrook, who predicts a cooling in the near future. However, his predictions have been outrageously incorrect for the first 10 years of its data. The following graph depicts Easterbrook’s failed predictions:[SkS3]   You can see from the graph that temperatures have actually increased, not declined as Eastberbook predicted.  Further, although Easterbrook portrays the IPCC’s prediction of the temperatures since 2000 as incorrect, the IPCC actually got the story much closer to reality than Easterbrook. When confronted as to where Easterbrook obtained the IPCC data, he claimed he got it from the website, but that they had deleted it. The data he portrays shows future temperature predictions based on greenhouse gasses alone, which is not the actual IPCC data from the IPCC reports (which included natural factors as well). In other words, Easterbrook’s model has failed to predict what has occurred and his refutations of IPCC findings refutes a dataset that the IPCC never even used in their report because it is not a complete picture of the causes of warming. R2) Sea levels and ice levels  Con says that Al Gore said all the ice would be gone by now. We never cited Al Gore and there are a lot of unscientific things said in his documentary. Who cares what he said, Al Gore is not a scientist nor a viable source.  Con drops the IPCC study that says ice levels will continue to decline in the future.  Con also says that some Coast Guard boat is also seeing ice up north. We have never said there is zero ice anymore. Con is just straw-manning.  Third, Con cites some sketchy tabloid-esque picture of the northern ice sheet. Taking 2 photos a year apart does not prove anything. You need to look at averages. If you take a photo on a bad day in 2012 and a really good day for the ice sheet in 2013, it might look like the ice sheet is increasing, but you have to look at annual average size, not the size on a particular date. It’s the same problem with saying “it’s cold outside today, so there’s no global warming.” If you measure global temperature on one day in 2012 and on one day in 2013 and say, “see the temperature has gone down,” that’s not proof that global temperatures are falling. Again, we need to look at yearly averages, not snapshots of a single day.  Here is the *average* amount of ice in the ice sheet over time; it’s declining (because it’s melting). Next, Con cites Dr. Koonin, who didn’t say global warming doesn’t exist, but merely that climate models are uncertain. Something can still be a threat, even if the models are not accurate to 100% certainty.  Con also notes that temperatures have not risen dramatically over the last 30 years. This is due to a series of El Nino events that have pushed some hot water from the surface into the deep ocean. This effect will not continue forever; we just got lucky that ocean circulation shifts managed to shift some heat into the deep oceans. IPCC climate models that predict an increase in temperature of 2 degrees in the future account for these El Nino events.  Con also says that sea levels have not been rising any faster than in the past. However, sea levels have been rising *twice* as fast over the last 20 years than they did in the preceding 80 years. Con looks at an 8 year period and says the rate isn’t increasing, but the only reason that would be relevant is if the rate of CO2 emissions was a lot higher at the end of the 8 year period than at the beginning. If the amount of CO2 emitted by humans per year stayed relatively constant over this period, you wouldn’t expect sea levels to start rising any faster. Also, Con is merely cherry picking an 8 year period that looks favorable to them. If you look at trends over a broader time scale (100 years), the rate of increase has gone up.  Con then merely straw mans our argument and says that if polar ice caps had *completely* melted already (something we never claimed), then French Guyana would be underwater. We never made this claim. We only said that some island nations, like Kiribati, have thus far been swallowed by the sea. R3) Global warming is, on balance, good  First, Con can’t outweigh a threat. Nukes are a threat. On balance, mutually assured destruction may be beneficial to global peace, but nukes are still a “threat” to the United States. Even if something has some good effects, it can still be a threat.  Second, Con’s points don’t outweigh the harms of global warming.  (A) Health Effects  Con claims that overall health would be positively impacted by higher temperatures. However, they don’t link their source (they cite a book, but don’t provide a link or a page number). There’s no scientific explanation for why strokes or respiratory disease would decline with warmer temperatures. Research has also shown that the severity of the flu virus would *increase* (not decrease) as temperatures warmed. Warmer winters lead to more severe flu outbreaks--which, by definition, means a warming climate would make flu epidemics more widespread and harmful.  Con also claims that “extreme cold” has killed more people than heat waves. However, “extreme cold” refers to people who have died in blizzards or while backpacking. If you don’t prepare for the cold when you go outside, you’re going to die. In contrast, people don’t die in their houses because it’s too cold; they can always throw on more blankets. People without air conditioning, however, do die from heat waves. A 2003 heatwave in Europe killed 35,000 people. On balance, “increases in heat-related deaths due to climate change would outweigh decreases in deaths from cold-snaps.” (B) Economic Effects Con never proves that the benefits to crop outweighs the $1.9 trillion per year the US will lose due to global warming. Also, we already refuted these arguments last round. Con says that a “moderate” increase in temperatures benefits crops, but there’s no proof the increase will stay moderate and once it becomes too severe, crops are severely harmed. In addition, while crops grow faster in warmer climates, they grow too fast, leaving less time to mature, so they produce fewer edible byproducts.   R4) Effects of CO2First, Con says we have prove that human-caused warming is a “substantial” part of warming, but we don’t have to prove it’s a substantial threat, just a threat, so this is *not* something we have to prove. The degree of danger from the threat can make it *more* of a threat, but a threat is still a threat. Second, CO2 has a cascade effect. When CO2 causes temperature to increase a little bit, that causes more evaporation from the oceans which leads to more water vapor in the atmosphere. So even if water vapor has the largest effect on global warming, CO2 emissions cause more water vapor to be released into the air, which is called a positive feedback loop. (“The amplifying effect of water vapor has been observed in empirical studies such as Soden 2001”). Third, Con is conceding the greenhouse effect exists in this contention, which destroys their first contention, where they are trying to deny that the greenhouse effect is even a real phenomenon.</t>
<h>    On balance, “increases in heat-related deaths due to climate change would outweigh decreases in deaths from cold-snaps.” Economic Effects Con never proves that the benefits to crop outweighs the $1.9 trillion per year the US will lose due to global warming.</h>

    <t>We are not going to make new arguments, and keep it to a summary.  We've proven that global warming will cause massive amounts of economic harms, and a large increase in the death toll. The magnitude of the impacts are so large, even if we only prove a small probability of human-caused warming, we win that it is a 'threat.' The same is true of nuclear war: it is a threat because the magnitude of its impacts is so large, even if the probability of it happening is small. C1Our opponents argue that tropospheric warming is minimal and that no hotspot exists. This is incorrect. Our opponent’s first graph shows no error bars. With no source along with the graph, it is impossible to properly fact check it--we don’t know if the author of the graph is legitimate--however, we provide references with all the graphics we use, most of which coming from peer-reviewed articles. The study which proposes a lot of the anti-tropospheric warming argumentation (Douglass et al) has multiple problems with it. When errors are corrected and error bars added, models correctly replicate tropospheric warming. Further, research by climate skeptic John Christy eviscerates the supposed discrepancy between surface temperatures and tropospheric temperatures which the CON team brings up. When measurement error in radiosonde and satellite data are corrected, the discrepancy is erased. Only small discrepancies exist near the tropics in radiosonde data, however most researchers think the difference is due to still unknown “instrument errors”. Two hotspot graphs used by CON are based upon radiosonde data. These graphs attempt to show the tropospheric hot spot does not exist. However there is no discrepancy between predictions and observable measurements except in the tropics--these graphs use these locations. However, the stations in the tropics are spread out and too few in number to provide a realistic picture as to what is going on with the climate. Overall, these results should be taken with a grain of salt. When these issues are accounted for, tropospheric hotspots are found to exist.  [RC]  As can be seen, there are very few radiosonde positions in the tropics.   Our opponents claim CO2 is logarithmic to temperature. We agree with this and are well versed with this piece of information. Our opponent’s graph demonstrates the effect of CO2 (with no feedbacks) is about 1 degree C of warming per doubling of CO2 (from pre industrial levels). This is accepted by both sides of the aisle. If feedbacks are included, the effect of CO2 doubling is likely 3 degrees C. The logarithmic effect also means that every doubling of CO2 will have about the same forcing (eg, 100 to 200 ppm 3 degrees, 200 to 400 another 3, etc). Again, the logarithmic effect is accepted by everyone in the field of science--the question is again, the effect of feedbacks, something our opponents have not mentioned.  CON also argues the IPCC has failed to predict temperatures. However, this is incorrect. Using an average of GISS, NASA, NOAA, NCDC, and the HADCRUT4 surface temperatures, the IPCC has accurately predicted temperatures over the period of 1990 - 2012. The IPCC predicted 0.2 degrees C warming per decade, which is well within the margin of error for actual temperatures (0.15 degrees C per decade, +/- 0.08).   [SkS]  C2   Our opponents paint a very optimistic picture in relation to sea level rise. An extensive study in 2008, using measurements from satellites, has found that the rate of sea level rise has actually  increased from 1870 - 2006. The reason for a small reduction in sea levels--which our opponents cite--are likely from the volcanic eruptions from the 1960s - 90s, which caused cooling. However, when these eruptions ceased, sea levels again rose. In fact, “the rate of rise over the five most recent 20-year periods is 25% greater than the next largest set of values during the 1940s” .    Our opponent’s study used more regionalized stations to measure sea level. The graph claiming no increase in heat content is based on the NODC study Levitus et al. HOWEVER, our opponents graph ONLY resembles the graph using depths of up to 700 meters. And even then, there is a significant increase in heat content increase not reported in CON’s graph. Using global ocean heat content, the rate continues to increase and does not “flatten”. Our opponents source (likely from the skeptic blogosphere) misrepresents the actual findings of the study.   Tuvalu is regional, not global, and therefore is not relevant to this debate. Simply because sea level is falling in one area does not mean the global average will display the same characteristics.    C3 (a)Health Benefits  Our opponent cites our source but misrepresents its content. The flu worsens with warming temperatures because the warmer it is, the less flu there is on a certain season. However, the following season sees a dramatic outbreak of the flu significantly worse than in previous years due to the fact that 1) fewer people catch the disease and 2) threat perception decreases. And with a perception of threat low, fewer vaccinate, and therefore there is more disease in the long term.   To argue deaths from cold snaps override deaths from heatwaves is untrue. The EPA, as previously cited, was using data from a large review of the literature published by cambridge. To counter… you cite an op-ed. Now, that does not mean you are inherently incorrect, but the literature has already refuted that hypothesis. A recent publication has found that “[w]hile global tem­per­a­ture is indeed increasing, so too is the vari­ability in tem­per­a­ture extremes”. They also found, “this means that even as overall tem­per­a­tures rise, we may still con­tinue to expe­ri­ence extreme cold snaps”. In other words, not only will people die from heat waves, but cold snaps will still exist and will still cause substantial harm, negating the premise of Lomborg’s op-ed. The World Health Organization also disagrees, arguing the effect to human health will be catastrophic. In one large heat wave in Europe, “more than 70,000 excess deaths were recorded” .   Our opponents have also ignored our argument on Dengue fever and other tropical illnesses. The dengue fever used to be only a tropical disease, but climate change has caused it to be much more widespread. Further, malaria and other infectious diseases are destined to kill more people as the climate warms.(b) Economic effects  Our opponents claim we never responded to their position on crops. This is incorrect. We did in all of our rounds. We demonstrated a harm to the farming economy, and the fact that more CO2 = faster maturing plants, which = fewer plant yields. The NRC has looked at the literature, and finds that if the world warms 3 degrees C, crop yields will fall dramatically. If it increases, 2 degrees, there will still be a decrease. And if it increases 1 degree (this is with no feedbacks), there will be a decrease in yields except in mid latitude areas. Overall, the effect will be negative. To claim that water vapor is weak is contradictory to previous claims you have made, which argue water vapor is the primary greenhouse gas. Without feedbacks, the doubling of CO2 will increase temperatures by 1 degree celsius. This is not “insignificant”, and is enough to begin the positive feedback loop. Empiricals studies have demonstrated this effect, and climate sensitivity is generally considered about 3 degrees C per doubling of CO2.  Further, our opponent’s math is incorrect. It takes about 5 co2 doublings from the pre-industrial period to reach 7000 ppm. This, with sensitivity and the logarithmic effect accounted for, would lead to 15 degrees C of warming, not 54 degrees. This is within the margin of error, meaning the examples presented do not disprove the relationship between CO2 and temperature. Further, the temperature was closer to +15 degrees, not +10 like CON argues. In the Cambrian, there is no real accurate picture of what temperatures were like, due to the fact it was so long ago. Further, these calculations fail to account for the position of the continents or the sun, which also affect climate. Where the landmass was in the cretaceous is “may have had a radiative effect equivalent to +1 CO2 doubling” [Royer, personal correspondence]. This means that to get an accurate picture of the climate, we have to account for other factors. In fact, recent research has demonstrated this, and finds that the climate sensitivity to CO2 is at least 3 degrees C. The fact is, a look into history supports AGW theory, it does not weaken it.   Again, a graph which does not show much at all. It does not account for other factors which may be stunting warming (e.g. aerosols). The IPCC has looked into the evidence within this time frame, and finds that “it is very likely that glacial-interglacial CO2 variations have strongly amplifed climate variations”.</t>

    <t>Contention 1: No Major/any CO2 Increase.      Many Global Warming advocates state that CO2 levels are skyrocketing, but that is incorrect. I give you the above graph measuring the past 600 million years of CO2 levels are we are actually at an all time low. Now the website I got this from no longer has this page up so I appologize. We can see from observance of this graph that we being at all time CO2 low levles that we are nowhere close to meeting the impact that my opponent brings up. We have been over 5,000 ppm of CO2 in our atmosphere and are now currently around apprx. 350 ppm CO2 levels.  The above graph shows that comparisions of C13 (Carbon isotope) and this shows that there is little to no trend pertrade in many of these as the average is zero while the trend for all of these are zero. This is important as the Carbon isotope is important in measuring this so called 'Global Warming.'  This chart above shows the CO2 and Earth's temperatures for the past 600 million years. My opponent's claims are incorect as we have had aburd levels of CO2 and temperature on Earth and may I ask how did we survive that? Now I will move on to how Earth is actually cooling and how it's temperature is cooler than it has been. Contention 2: Earth is cooling.  If we observe the above graph we can see that Earth has been a whole lot hotter than where we currently are to the point where the Earth's average temperature has been 7.5 degrees Celcuis hotter than it currently it is. You can also see that in the span of the past 10,000 years the temperature has leveld off, but you may ask yourself where does that place us in the lights of modern day?  I am going to site Dr. Done Easterbrook, who is a climate scientist. Back in 2000 he predicted that Earth was entering a cooling phase. He predicts that for the next 20 years Earth will cool by 3/10 degree each year and that we are going to enter another little Ice Age like we did from 1650 and 1790. The funny thing is that many of my opponent's charts are actually from the incorrect IPPC. How about the 'Hockey Stick' graph that many Global Warming supporters , including my opponent, argue about? Well if we observe the fallowing chart taken from Northern Scandenavia we can see that the Global trend over the past 1,000 years that the Global Cooling trend slope is that of -0.31 Degrees Celcuis, give or take 0.03 degrees (for the error room). Professor Dr. Jan Esper has found that the Earth's temperature of Earth actually decreases 0.3 per millenia due to the Earth moving away from the sun. Here is another graph from 1920 to 2005 and we can see that the graph has a negative temperature slope, thus meaning that the Earth is under a period of cooling. Contention 3: Artic Ice. First, I would like to state that Pro's claim about the North Pole completely melting is bogus. Al Gore stated that the Artic Ice would be completely melted by 2014, but he is incorrect then and now.  Jan. 6, 2012: The Coast Guard Cutter Healy breaks ice around the Russian-flagged tanker Renda 250 miles south of Nome. The Healy is the Coast Guard’s only currently operating polar icebreaker. The vessels are transiting through ice up to five-feet thick in this area. The 370-foot tanker Renda will have to go through more than 300 miles of sea ice to get to Nome, a city of about 3,500 people on the western Alaska coastline that did not get its last pre-winter fuel delivery because of a massive storm. Let's go back to 2007-2008 and see if his claim was justified in the Artic Ice activity.  Hmmm... It seems that he is incorrect, but let's look further into the near past. How about 2012-2013? We all remember the Climate Scientists that got stuck in Arctic Ice Earlier this year correct? Then a Russian Ice Breaker tried to free them, but got stuck. Can you guess what they were studying? They had predicted that all the Arctic Ice had melted due to Global Warming and that Earth would get flooded massively. Boy were they wrong. How about Al Gore. The man who brought Global Warming to our attention? In 2009, the man breaks down in tears stating how it's nothing, but hot air and how he fabricated everything just for the money! He said the arctic sheets are not melting and CO2 is not responsible for depletion of the Ozone. Dr. Koonin, former head of the Department of Energy under President Obama, has stated that the Global Warming scare is not suttle. This is because that he has found 3 things wrong and highly incorrect about the scare. 1. Shrinking of Artic Sea ice doesn't acount for the gaining of the Antartic ice. 2. The warming of Earth's temps today is the same as it was 30 years ago. 3. The sea levels rose at the same height and rate in the 20th cenury. Contention 4: Sea Levels  Here is another corralation that must happen. If the Ice Caps are completely melted as Pro claims then the sea level would have risen completely drowning tons of land.  The graph above is raw satellite image data of the sea level rise over an 8 year period showing that there is little to no change in the Sea Levels rising. The sea level rises, on average, about 3 inches per century and it has been found to not even been rising at all.  This graph is the sea levels off the cost of French Guyana which is one of the areas which is predicted to be flooded due to Global Warming, but as you can see by the graph (which goes to 2008) the sea level is currently on a downward trend. The source is the PDF within the link.Contention 5: The Weather My opponent is claiming that Hurricanes are increasing due to Global Warming, but this claim is indeed false! The hurricanes since the year 1900 to 2008 have actually been decreasing. The slope of this downward slope is .0016. Though it is small the hurricanes are still in a downward trend.As a matter of fact not only are Hurricanes on a downward trend, but they are at an all time low as in the year 2010, there was only 68 Hurricanes Globally, which is an all time low in the past 40 years. How about Tornados you may ask? In the graph above you can see that tornados are at an all time low in the past 60 years! But what about Hurricanes? Here is a graph showing the number of days between hurricanes and this shows that the number of days between hurricanes is greatest at 76 days between hurricanes.The slope of this line is zero showing no trend of a massive storm increase.Now I must end my argument here before I run out of my characters. On to you Pro.</t>

    <t>First of all I want to touch on your rebuttal that carbon levels have not increased drastically over the course of earths existence. Although it is true that earth had much more carbon dioxide several million years ago this was counteracted by massive amounts of plant life that photosynthesized to create the air you breath today and the oil you put in your car. thus the massive amount of Co2 drops that range from super volcano explosions from Yosemite national park or other cataclysmic events that caused the death of millions of plants and thus a spike in Co2 levels. It would be nice to imagine that this is natural but it is not. For as you see in his very first graph Co2 levels are going up at a faster rate than any other time period besides the late Cambrian period. Yet this increase is not due to any natural cataclysmic but instead a self made increase in Co2 which has increased by a factor of five in a mere 200 years. This time zone is a speck in your million year graph but is increasing at a exponential rate and has yet to slow. I would also like to answer your rhetorical question that you posed on how we survived such'absurd levels of Co2 and temperature on Earth' and the fact is we didn't have to because the Co2 fluctuation that you are describing happened hundreds of millions of years in the past were the earth would have not been able to support human life as we know it. In your third graph you once again use data from hundreds of millions of years ago to set a standard for earths temperature. The two temperature shifts happened for very different reasons one being asteroid induced Apocalypse and the current Co2 increase due to human activity.  In relation to your arguments that global temperature readings are going down NASA would beg to differ as they have recorded a gradual increase in temperature. I am also curious when you are saying my opponents graphs or I disagree with both Al Gore and the IPCC on their global warming estimates but you continue to use a straw man argument and putting words in my mouth that I never said.  I also have problems with your hockey stick graph which does not have its y axis labeled and the line of best fit that was drawn on the graph after that because it is not accurate to NASA climate readings and thus I can only assume are based on land based climate measurement stations that can be quoted by both believers and skeptics of global warming due to their chronic irritability.  You have also miss quoted my statement on arctic ice which i did not say was melting but rather I said that the ozone layer is weakening above it. Although this hole is slowly repairing itself it is still weak to fluctuation and thus we are very lucky that it is repairing itself after decades of damage by CFC's.Scientists also have no clue as to why arctic ice is thickening and do not know how long it will last. Thus I o not believe that the melting of arctic ice will lead to a increase in sea level know due to the still unexplained thickening of arctic ice but if we do not do something this unexplained blessing may revert back to its original melting stage that will cause cities like New York and Boston to be more susceptible to flooding.  In relation to your data on storms I miss wrote my opinion for you are correct that their have currently been less storms than in the past. However, the storms that do get created have been far more devastating and have shown up in places that almost never receive a hurricane the most prominent example being New York and even further back hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. Tornadoes have become less common due to reasons that scientists do not understand because we still do not fully understand how tornado are created.  I also noticed how you left out my argument on droughts due to the definitive proof that the number of droughts have increased around the world from the Midwest to India these drought swill only get worse and slowly rising temperatures will only exasperate the problem  Finally I would ask that you research your graphs a little bit more for the Co2 graphs you found that spanned millions of years had almost nothing to do with global warming as well as not discounting a phenomena just because the scientific community does not fully understand it. Good luck in our counter argument</t>

    <t>Firstly I'd like to point out that Co2 is not CO2, because Co is the element symbol for Cobalt not Carbon Dioxide. Please be careful. My opponent argues stating that the graphs of millions of years ago doesn't matter, but it does, because if the harms of Global Warming that my opponent says are true then we currently wouldn't be here, because as I have showed Earth has had CO2 levels and Global Temperatures way higher then we currently do. This shows that my opponent's case has no impact to it. Then he goes on to say that there's a spike in levels due to oil and such, but if you remember the chart that I have given you in my last round you can see that it has a negative slope with means that Earth is actually cooling. In my 4th Graph you can see that the IPPC is incorrect in there readings of Global Warming and that we are currently cooling and heading into another Little Ice Age.  As for you EPA souce, I have already pre-refuted that in my last round with my hockey stick chart evidence showing that we have a negative slope in terms of the Global Temperature showing that we are cooling and not warming.  My opponent drops my second graph showing that though we have had a major increase in the burning of focil fuels that it has had no effect on the atmosphere. My Hockey stick Chart, if you click on the link that I had provided you, is from the Johannes Guttenburg University where the scienctists there conducted a study and that was their evidence. This study was conducted in the Artic Lattitudes and, you would think that if Global Warming exists that it would have an upward slope, but it has a down ward slope.  Last Decade the US has passed the Kyoto Protocol which banned the Production of CFC's from first world nation's, but will have no real impact due to it excluding countries like China and India. You can see in terms of more Warming in the evidence in which Scientists use Ice Cores Earth has actually been Cooling the past Mellenium.  You can see that in terms of Gasses contribution to the Green House Effect the major contributer is Water Vapor and it's at 95% to CO2's 3.6% and this is the overall contribution including man made and natural. When we look to the chart on the left we can see that Man-Made CO2 does have a higher contribution to the atmosphere than Water Vapor, but that's because we do not create much water vapor as humans. Even with this evidence we can see that CO2 does not have any effect what-so-ever compared to Water Vapor. Where might those CFCs be on this graph you may ask. Why it's under the Misc. gases section. Though the world has been in a drought for hundreds of years the techonology has been picking up with new agricultural techonolgies like GMOs and factory farming.</t>

    <t>First of all sorry for the CO2 typo spellchecker loves to hate on me  I am also a bit annoyed that you have misconstrued my point on the first few graphs you used which had a measurement of earths greenhouse gas levels over millions of years. To be clear these CO2 spikes happened due to mass extinctions that left a majority of plant life dead on the earth. Thus unless you are implying that massive amounts of plant life is dying the current spike of CO2 is man made. And in relation to your graphs that earth is heading towards a cooing era the measurements used to take them were provably ground based temperature readers that tend to vary widely. For NASA's reading of global temperatures has read a stead increase in global temperature by a total of 1 degree Fahrenheit. Though that fact may no seem scary that mere temperature change has huge ecological and weather ramifications. And if this trend continues and earths CO2 emission only increases than this temperature shift will increase at a quickening pace.  In relation to the hockey stick graph I looked into what the graph actually meant seeing as their was not labeling o the axis but what it does show is a 0.3 temperature drop per millennium. In the last 20 years the earth has had temperature increase of 1 degree Fahrenheit. Thus their is no way that the earth progressively moving away from the sun will effectively counteract climate change.  Also the effects of CFC's are very different than traditional greenhouse gases for this dangerous gas, for lack of a better term, eats up ozone and is largely responsible for the hole in the ozone layer that has slowly developed over the arctic circle. Thus it is a completely different and much more dangerous greenhouse gas than CO2 and Methane.  In relation to your graphs on overall greenhouse gas contribution I have not seen repeated in ever source I looked at with the average impact of Humans on global warming to be between 3 and 5 percent. Although this may not seem scary this small percentage change is several billion tons of CO2 that affect the rates of the greenhouse effective and over time( and i'm talking about hundreds of years) will lead to exponential temperature growth. Right now it is linear but will only level out if mankind as a whole reduce carbon emissions or find some way to create balance between our CO2 creation and capturing. To see some of these solutions I recommend you watch the Nova special on global warming.</t>

    <t>You see as the human population increases the number extintions for different animals also increase due to our need for resources and the human population is growing and when the resources are used up we move on like a paracite. Extintion rates have been increasing because of this. You have provided one graph while I have provided several that say the same thing done by different sources and not NASA and the EPA which can be bias to your case. (If you wish to debate on the EPA we could do so when this debate is finished) It's the steadiness in the graph that makes me question the validity of the information while mine so both increases and decreases.  You have looked up the hockey stick graph, but I have shown that in my graphs that the hockey stick graph does not exist and that it is unlikely that the Earth is warming at all as I have shown in several graphs that the Earth's temperature is decreasing. I have shown that it is cooling and that the IPPC is incorrect on their Warming Predictions.  My opponent now brings up one theory relying on the Ozone hole, but this is incorrect as the World Health Organization (WHO) has found that the Ozone is actually getting thicker and is expected to make a great recovery by 2025 due to the banning of Hydrocarbons. My opponent attempts to refute the last graph that I had provided in my last round, but even though we are dumping large amounts of CO2, methane, and CFCs into the atmosphere they are contributing little to Global Warming. The graph shows how much it contributes not the quanitity and it shows that Water Vapor by far is more superior than that of CO2, Methane, and CFCs combined!</t>

    <t>Firstly I'm confused by your first graph which has nothing to do with the topic of global warming  I also don't think you understand my points on your graphs. Your graphs on temperature are either based on ice core temperatures which is imprecise when used as a measure of temperature especially over short periods of time which is what global warming demands as in order to study. Or your measurements are based on terrestrial based temperature readers which have been use by both anti global warming and anti global warming pundits because they are so chronically unreliable. The NASA measurements are the closest possible reliable source of information because they are taken from space which gives the the most complete view of the planet.  On the 'theory' that the ozone layer has developed hole above the arctic circle is not a theory because it has happened. And the hypothesis that the WHO presented does not account for CFC's that are being made in china and India  And in relation to the fact that water account for the greenhouse effect than other greenhouse gases is correct however I believe you are underestimating how much greenhouse gases is composed of three percent of all greenhouse gases (the percentage that is man made). For this 3% accounts for several billions of tons of greenhouse gas such as CO2 and methane that humans are putting in the atmosphere. This increase upsets the natural equilibrium of the greenhouse effect and in time will lead to an exponential increase in temperatures. over 97% of scientists agree with this theory and distrust of general scientific theory is only harmful to the continued existence of mankind.</t>

    <t>My first graph was showing the CO2 spike that Pro may be refuring to is from massive plant extintion and not from CO2 emmissions. As for satellite readings I give you the second and 5th chart from Round 2. These both are satellite imagings and they both show the same thing. That CO2 levels do not affect the atmosphere Much like the 2nd graph in Round 3 we can see that CO2 and even man-made at that matter has no affect and doesn't contribute to Global Warming as Water Vapor does. It also shows that the IPPC is incorrect and many of the NASA scientists are in the IPPC and this actually discredits their sourcing. The Ozonen hole is above the Antartic, not the artic. The graph does include the CFCs from third world nations. As for the CO2 gasses contributing, I know that there are billions of tons, but it still doesn't contibute to the Greenhouse effect even comparably close to Water Vapor. This shows that there is no corrilation between Warming and CO2.  Now as for those 97% of scientists that my opponent was talking about.  When it comes to scientists there are a total of 2,500 scientists that do believe in Global Warming, but when it comes to not believing in Global Warming there is a large amount that have signed a petition stating that they believe that Global Warming is a hoax. There is a current count of 31,487.</t>

    <t>My case is that global warming, the phenomena in which greenhouse gases and ozone destroying chemicals, is a prevalent problem that currently affects the global health of the plant. It has led to more a more deadly weather pattern, stronger storms, droughts a rising sea level, a hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica. If steps are not taken to reduce the emission of green house gases and other destructive chemicals that cause acceleration of the greenhouse effect the climate will progressively grow hotter and will lead to further drought, storms, and eventually making earth a inhospitable place or humans to live. Good luck to your counter argument. You don't need to sight your sources but be aware I will fact check everything you say.</t>

    <t>I believe that if the US banned gas powered cars, you would be absolutely destroying the US economy. First of all, the average electric car can only travel 40 to 100 miles on each full charge, whereas a gas car can travel 370-400 miles on a full tank. Another thing to think about is how electric cars are not too advanced yet.  Second of all, very many oil companies would go out of business, causing an absolute crash of the US economy. A very large amount of people work for oil and gas companies, even a lot of gas stations could go out of business. Many other companies would hurt from this, seeing that most-all semi trucks run off of diesel gasoline, and we all know that semi trucks carry goods needed for many stores/companies.

    <t>Thank you, opponent, for giving me a chance to debate with you. I hope this can be an enjoyable experience for the both of us.Arguments:1. Less people die.My opponent correctly suggests that, in recent years, children and infants have died less frequently from disease. This is due to great advances in medicine. However, those great advances in medicine have also brought other, much less desirable, effects.Thalidomide:Thalidomide was first sold in Germany as an over the country drug in 1957. It was used in the hopes that it would prevent morning sickness in pregnant women, which it did. Unfortunately, however, it had the side effect of deforming the limbs of unborn children whose Mothers had taken the drug. Of the 10,000 children born with limbs that were malformed because of the drug, only 5,000 survived. Thalidomide was a case of drug companies destroying the lives of 10,000 people without malicious intent. It was also, as my opponent will doubtlessly point out, over 50 years ago. Whilst this is true, there are much more recent, yet less infamous, issues with the advances of medicine which have undoubtedly made lives worse. One example of this is in a BBC news report from 2006:[1] 'Six men remain in intensive care after being taken ill during a clinical drugs trial in north-west London. The healthy volunteers were testing an anti-inflammatory drug at a research unit based at Northwick Park Hospital when they suffered a reaction. Relatives are with the patients, who suffered multiple organ failure. Two men are said to be critically ill.'This shows that the advancement of medicine has not necessarily made lives better, in fact, it could be said that, although more people now survive diseases, their quality of life is lower. An example of this would be the euthanasia debate.In the past, your doctor would help you survive disease until the point where you were in insufferable pain which could not be alleviated. At this point, your doctor could, and often would, make the decision to ease your passing with an overdose of drugs (normally morphine) with your consent. [2] 'Throughout classical antiquity, there was widespread support for voluntary death as opposed to prolonged agony, and physicians complied by often giving their patients the poisons they requested.'This was made illegal in the UK in 1961, meaning that those suffering from a painful, debilitating and terminal disease may not make the decision to end their life with help if they're unable to do it alone. This is not just in the UK, euthanasia is illegal in almost every country in the world.[3] 'As of 2014, euthanasia is only legal in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg.'Despite even this, the increase in world population is not inherently a good thing in itself. It has led to oppressive but necessary policies such as the Chinese one child policy, which has seen the murder of many young girls in the hopes that the parents will have a son. Thus, my argument is that whilst life expectancy has gotten longer, quality of life has not.2. Better technology for everybodyMy opponent again correctly suggests that technology has not only improved over the years, but has also become more available to the average peasant (citizen). However, this is not necessarily a good thing.My opponent asserts: 'Not to mention we have much cheaper methods than trains--with our new subways all around--and better airplanes--from Wright's first to now, fighter jets and humongous airliners-- transportation is cheaper, easier, and faster than ever. With better transportation, countries can trade more easier, and people can get from place to place easier as well. The world is definitely changing for the better with these technological innovations.'This is all very well and good, however, the increase in 'better transport' has massively increased the consumption of oil and other natural resources all around the world. Here we see the increase in diesel consumption per year in just the USA. This data only goes up to the year 1998, however, I can tell you that the fuel consumption in the year 2013 in just the USA [4]'about 134.51 billion gallons1 (or 3.20 billion barrels) of gasoline.'This tremendous increase in the use of natural resources has resulted in a tremendous increase in greenhouse gases emmitted into the atmosphere, notably carbon dioxide.As you can see here, the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased substantially from 1960-2010. This is resulting in a 'warming' on a global scale. An effect that is commonly known as 'global warming.'This has resulted in the extinction of countless species and will result in the extinction of countless more.[5]'Polar bears have started drowning as they have had to swim longer distances between ice flows, and the U.S. Geological Survey has predicted that if the Arctic ice cape continues melting at its current rate, “two-thirds of the world's polar bear sub-populations will be extinct by mid-century.”7 Of course, it is not just the polar bear that is affected—one study predicts that a quarter of land animals and plants could become extinct because of global warming over the next 45 years.8'[6]'Parmesan and most other scientists hadn't expected to see species extinctions from global warming until 2020. But populations of frogs, butterflies, ocean corals, and polar birds have already gone extinct because of climate change, Parmesan said.'My opponent implies that communication has become easier in the past few hundred years with the invention of increasingly better, more convenient and inexpensive telephones, right up to the mobile phone. I would agree with him, but that does not mean that the quality of communication has gone up. In fact, I would argue that the quality of communication has definitely gone down.I want to transport my reader back to a time that is no longer in living memory. A time where telephones did not exist and the easiest form of long-range communication was a letter. I want to transport my reader back to the 1830's, to a young girl called Victoria, who would later be known as Queen Victoria. She wished to write her sister, whom had gone to live with the Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, a letter. It had been many years since she had been allowed to see her sister, and after writing the letter she waited excitedly for a reply. Can you imagine her dismay when, a few days later, she opened an envelope addressed to her from her sister to see nothing but the letter 'K' written upon an almost blank piece of paper?This, of course, never happened. The cost of sending a letter, whilst not expensive, was costly enough to ensure detailed communication with ones friends and loved ones which invoked a feeling of closeness that is not as often seen in the communications of today. This is primarily because now, with the invention of social media and texting, it is so incredibly easy to lose the sense of connection that communication held in the time of letters. Lengthy and structured replies are no longer seen as important, formality is an art that is often no longer understood or seen to be necessary. The phenomenon of the 'K' response is often wrote about, it is well recognised for its rude abruptness, yet many people still continue to use it because, with the invention of easier communications, there is little practical reason not to. Thus, I argue that whilst the quantity of communication has increased, the quality of communication has gone down. As has, therefore, the quality of friendships and relationships.More arguments next round.</t>

    <t>I thank my opponent for accepting. Seeing how he is unbeatable, I'll make my arguments extra tough!*WARNING*: Lots of pictures. Don't blame me if I miss a picture that can't be seen. I can't make sure all of them remain pictures. Let's start off with the basics.1. Less people dieAs modern medicine is improving, less people die by disease. The two graphs below  show that fewer and fewer children are dying.  Just in case my opponent somehow accuses my source being 'biased', I shall provide another graph to back up my information:Japan? Japan's just being weird. :P Besides, it's such a small region, it doesn't really effect the overall resolution anyways. We don't really know whether Japan is changing for the better, but certainly the world is.Thus it is evident, we save lives of innocent children; the world is definitely changing for the better. Now onto argument number two...2. Better technology for everbodyAs the world progresses so does its transportation. Before we started off with the first car ever made...Now we have ultra-aerodynamic cars....s://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com...; alt='' width='708' height='398' /gt;They move gazillions time faster than the first car ever, and are far more efficient. Not to mention we have much cheaper methods than trains--with our new subways all around--and better airplanes--from Wright's first to now, fighter jets and humongous airliners-- transportation is cheaper, easier, and faster than ever. With better transportation, countries can trade more easier, and people can get from place to place easier as well. The world is definitely changing for the better with these technological innovations.Not only so, communication has improved much. Long long ago, we had to use the telegraph. Then we moved on to the first telephone ever.Then we had home phones...Cellphones...And finally, the iPhone!!From hard communication, to easier communication, to the addition of internet searches, GPS, and games, our communication device has improved much, and it has become more and more helpful as we have improved. We see the world changing for the better with technology's vast improvements.  3. Poor people are being helped Not only less people are dying, and less people are getting sick, people are getting better medical benefits. 'in 2002, only 230,000 people in the developing world were getting treatment with lifesaving but expensive antiretroviral medicines.' www.mistergui.com/downloads/The%20Case%20for%20Optimism.doc says. 'Today, in part because the pharmaceutical industry moved from being a low-volume, high-margin business to a low-margin, high-volume one with guaranteed payments, that number is 8 million. ' Not only so, ' in the 25 years leading up to the current economic crisis, more people worldwide moved from poverty to the middle class than at any other time in history.' The next page of this article, states. Now, why is this important, other than saving people's lives as said in the first argument? Well, you see, thievery is mostly due to poor people not being able to make enough money for themselves or their family, and thus forced to steal from others. But since they are helped and no longer have to pay so much for medication, they can delve their efforts into other parts of financial responsibility and steal less, if they even continue to steal. This argument also has another (surprising) side effect. It's actually not technically a side effect. It's actually a side related policy that caused to help out people. You see, Brazil managed to efficiently cut its deforestation rates by 75%. How does this have to do with helping poor people? Well you can't help people without sufficient economy right? So therefore Brazil cut down on its oil spending, creating new jobs to support the economy, and maximizing the hydropower. Brazil, in an effort to change its own economy, helps its people. This of course applies to most other countries as well. They want to help their government and society? They have to start with the people. Thus, governments in their attempt to grow in power and influence, inevitably improve people's lives--and the environment for the animals' lives-- for the better.  Now let's go to....4. Human rightsHumans are gaining more and more rights as revolutions and rebellions occur. From the overall natural rights of life, liberty and pursuit of happiness to the voting rights of all men, including blacks, then to the civil war, where slavery was finally abolished, and recently, women gaining 'equal treatment of women and men under the law and voting rights.' Thus we see here, the rights progress, from everyone having practically completely different statuses--white men, black men, and women--transform into the men versus woman movement, and finally our people as one. Nowadays, pretty much the only right that women don't have is topless rights. We're working on that, though. After some debate we'll come to a good conclusion and do women justice. I have like 2,500 characters left but I can't really think of anything I haven't covered. Technology improved and helps everyone in their usual lives. People's living styles improved--with their environment around them improving too- and they are also gaining more rights as they continue to fight for themselves. The world is definitely changing for the better.Onto you, mighty unbeaten JayConar.</t>

    <t>Let's see now... 1. Enthusiana debate Of course, enthusiana was the only treatment availible during olden days. Nowadays we have alternative options availible. With increasing methods to keep these people alive without their massive pain, we have better care and training. The easy way out would not allow us to help doctors increase their skills of caring for these terminally ill persons. Furthermore, people who choose enthusiana are usually depressed and only see the sad side, the burdened side of life. By not taking the easy way out, we can learn about their problems that might be effecting their decisions. Maybe one day the man lost his job and his spouse died by heart disease, and he's so depressed he think he's sick too, and the only way out is enthusiana. But that's not right. We can treat his depression, we can treat his illusion of sickness. If we instantly just terminate him without really finding out about his sickness, then it's immoral. Also, we cannot learn how to treat the specific sickness, if the patient is really sick. What if 1,000 more people die of disease X, and we didn't investigate the first person who obtained the disease, just killed him with enthusiana! We lose many chances at medical research that could save the lives of others. The doctor also earns far too much power in enthusiana, and his diagnosis could be wrong, as well as new research that could change the outcome. His emotion or tiredness could affect his decision; too much variables could contribute to an immoral death. There are many reasons why enthusiana isn't legalized in all of those countries my opponent mentioned. There's a reason my opponent sourced a majority of countries that prefer no enthusiana to legalizing enthusiana. 2. Better technology So what that we consume fuel? We seek other sources; renewable sources that are more efficient and are more environmental, gaining more energy in the process! Carbon dioxide increase: *Laughs* I was expecting this argument. Now, look at his graph. Tell me what's wrong with it. Nothing? Okay, look on the right side....that's right... it's merely from 310 to 390, and we're merely counting the years 1960-2010. This is what the graph would look like if we started from zero:  Eh, eh? Doesn't look so bad now eh? Seriously, that graph is biased. On the other hand, if we look at the bigger picture.... We see here, even if carbon dioxide is being released (not to mention, at very small rates), the global temperature is not effected by it. In fact, the temperature is still decreasing as shown over time. Since the earth has not warmed, my opponent cannot contribute it to the 'extinction of countless species'. As for arctic melting, that makes no sense. The arctic is not melting at all, it is, in fact, expanding. We see it is obvious, my opponent is wrong. Wherever he got the idea of global warming, we don't know. But it isn't happening. As for the letter, my opponent only shows how our world nowadays is much better in communication. You see, long ago people just wrote 'K'. I even heard of a famous story of a writer who wrote to her publishers, '?' concerning her novel, and the publishers responding, '!'. Seriously guys? Now, we don't have to pay for these letters. We can instantly send them by email or by cell phone, much more quickly. The world is much more interconnected with email and computers; two friends separated by 3,000 miles no longer have to wait one month for each other's letters to arrive, they can instantly talk to each other with only waiting a few seconds--or milliseconds--to respond to each other's messages, and even see each other through face time! As you can see here, my opponent's case defeats his own. Global temperature is actually cooling, not warming. Enthusiana is illegal for a good reason. He dropped almost all of my arguments, and I hope he comes back to rebut them later. Back to you, mighty unbeaten Jay!</t>

    <t>My friend's argument relies on two things:1. Euthanasia is wrong in all circumstances.2. Global warming does not exist EuthanasiaMy opponent asserts that: 'enthusiana was the only treatment availible during olden days.' This statement is incorrect. Although my opponent was vague due to not explaining what he means by 'olden days' I'm going to assume he means classical antiquity.There were a number of medical textbooks in classical antiquity, as well as a number of famous physician's such as Paul of Aegina, whom wrote the '[1]Epitomes iatrikes biblio hepta'Surgery was also available as a treatment in antiquity.'If the wounded man or his companions attempted to extract an arrow by pulling on the shaft, there was a good chance that the arrowhead itself would be left within the wound. Celsus and Paul of Aegina offer step-by-step instructions that S. says would have been useful'.Thus euthanasia was not the only treatment available in antiquity, and would also only have been used on somebody who was in a terminal condition and was, therefore, suffering unbearable amounts of pain which would only lead to death anyway. My opponent has not offered a rebuttal for why euthanasia should not be used in cases such as this when, often, modern painkillers won't even take the edge off of pain that occurs when somebody is dying as to do so would mean giving the patient an overdose of one or another drug, which would be euthanising them. The argument sort of loops around like that.Global WarmingMy opponent asserts that: 'even if carbon dioxide is being released (not to mention, at very small rates), the global temperature is not effected by it.'My opponent has decided to argue that global warming does not exist. In doing this he decides to use this graph as evidence:We cannot be sure from exactly where my opponent found this graph, however, we can be sure that there is definitely a positive correlation as, with time, the PPM (Parts per million) of Carbon Dioxide steadily increases. This graph has been scaled all the way back to 1900 in order to make the positive correlation seem weaker, however the positive correlation is still extant. Therefore my opponent has worked to prove my point.My opponent asserts that the absorption of more Carbon Dioxide into the air does not effect the global temperature. To prove this he puts up a picture of the ice caps in September 2013 and September 2012.As we can see here, the global temperature does vary by about 0.2 of a degree quite frequently. However, the average global temperature has definitely increased exponentially since 1980 relative to 1880-1980. This suggests that there is a positive correlation between carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the global temperature. But a correlation does not necessarily suggest a causual relationship, so let's have a look at the science.'[3]Most of the light energy from the sun is emitted in wavelengths shorter than 4,000 nanometers (.000004 meters).  The heat energy released from the earth, however, is released in wavelengths longer than 4,000 nanometers.  Carbon dioxide doesn't absorb the energy from the sun, but it does absorb some of the heat energy released from the earth.  When a molecule of carbon dioxide absorbs heat energy, it goes into an excited unstable state.  It can become stable again by releasing the energy it absorbed.  Some of the released energy will go back to the earth and some will go out into space.'Thus global warming as a result of Carbon Dioxide is a very real thing which we should all be scared of and wouldn't have happened if not for the technological advancement in transport which Pro attempts to paint in a positive light. Back to you, Pro.</t>

    <t>1. Euthanasia Again, what makes this pain real? Who says for sure the patients were really suffering? The brain can fool the rest of the body in many, many cases. For one, The Rubber Hand experiment demonstrates how the brain fools you into feeling your hand in the place of a rubber hand, while in reality your hand is further to the left. Not only so, you can control your body temperature by pure will, or even by meditation. The brain can also confuse you into thinking that the below lines are awry, not straight, or at the very least not lined up, while in reality they are parallel.  2. Global Warming  My opponent only sources the time period of 140 years, from 1880 to 2020 predictions. He does not look at the bigger picture, at the general decline from year 1000 to modern time, or even from millions of years ago to now, there has been the similar pattern regardless of CO2 emissions. And even if CO2 does create global warming, (which, really, it's not even the main cause--global warming happens naturally due to climate changes, heavily due to changes in solar activity, it's not bad to us at all. 'CO2 levels are so low that more, not less, is needed to sustain and expand plant growth.', 'if CO2 levels are cut, he warns, food production will slow because plants grown at higher CO2 levels make larger fruit and vegetables and also use less water. ', and finally, 'Earth's atmosphere currently has about 338 parts per million of CO2 ....the danger level for carbon dioxide isn't reached until the air has 8,000 parts per million of CO2.' All of these quotes, show that CO2 not only helps the environment (remember who you are, Brazil, when you remember cut down their rate of deforestation!) it does not harm us humans at all.   Opponent has failed to uphold his burden of proof. He does evoke philosophical stances within euthanasia, and he even goes for environmental effects. But he dropped a majority of my arguments in round 2, forgetting to refute them (and refuting them in the last round would be unfair, and he would have to have a conduct point lost), and overall, I have won. This was a good debate, but I believe I have become the first person to ever beat out JayConar. We are changing for the better; the world is changing for the better. Vote for me.</t>

    <t>Final RoundSimply stating that you've won does not mean that you have actually won, I'm afraid.I have not dropped any of my opponents arguments, instead I have flipped them on their head, proving that the things that he paints in a positive light are, in fact, more negative than positive. Thus, I have rebutted my opponents points successfully and he had the BoP to prove that the world is actually changing for the better, he did not fulfill his BoP as I rebutted all his arguments. My opponent asserts that:'and refuting them in the last round would be unfair, and he would have to have a conduct point lost),'Yet he used the entirety of his last round refuting my rebuttals in which he essentially claims that pain does not exist as the brain is just tricking it (which is true, the brain is what makes you feel pain, but that does not stop an individual from suffering. If you stab yourself then it doesn't matter how much you think 'it's just my brain sending signals,' it will still hurt), and claiming that global warming is due to solar activity and not carbon dioxide which, as we can seeIt's not. As for danger levels of CO2 not being reached until it reaches 8,000 PPM, allow me to read you the entire quote which my opponent harmfully cut to pieces:'[1]He also said that higher CO2 levels are not harmful to humans. As an example, he said that Earth's atmosphere currently has about 338 parts per million of CO2 and that in Navy subs, the danger level for carbon dioxide isn't reached until the air has 8,000 parts per million of CO2.' The CO2 levels may not be harmful to humans, but that is not the argument, the argument is that the variance in the temperature caused by the warming which is caused by the CO2 increase in the atmosphere is harmful, and has led to the extinction, of many species, which I proved in a previous round.It should be mentioned that source 1 was also published in 2009, 5 years ago, scientific views change very quickly so something which was posted 5 years ago is incredibly out of date.Most of my opponent's last round is him, essentially, being irrelevant. Stating that pain is a mental process does not mean that people cannot be in insufferable pain and stating that you have won does not mean that you have won. My opponent has offered no argument that has got unrefuted by me, despite what he may think, and in this last round I have offered no new arguments, so conduct points should not be lost.Thank you for this debate.</t>

    <t>Contention 1: No Major/any CO2 Increase.      My opponent states that CO2 levels have never been this high, but that is incorrect. I give you the above graph measuring the past 600 million years of CO2 levels are we are actually at an all time low. Now the website I got this from no longer has this page up so I appologize. We can see from observance of this graph that we being at all time CO2 low levles that we are nowhere close to meeting the impact that my opponent brings up. We have been over 5,000 ppm of CO2 in our atmosphere and are now currently around apprx. 350 ppm CO2 levels.  The above graph shows that comparisions of C13 (Carbon isotope) and this shows that there is little to no trend pertrade in many of these as the average is zero while the trend for all of these are zero. This is important as the Carbon isotope is important in measuring this so called 'Global Warming.'  This chart above shows the CO2 and Earth's temperatures for the past 600 million years. My opponent's claims are incorect as we have had aburd levels of CO2 and temperature on Earth and may I ask how did we survive that? Now I will move on to how Earth is actually cooling and how it's temperature is cooler than it has been. Contention 2: Earth is cooling.  If we observe the above graph we can see that Earth has been a whole lot hotter than where we currently are to the point where the Earth's average temperature has been 7.5 degrees Celcuis hotter than it currently it is. You can also see that in the span of the past 10,000 years the temperature has leveld off, but you may ask yourself where does that place us in the lights of modern day? You can also see that Pro's graph is actually in the 500 to 10 thousand years before present and we can see that fallowing those trends that the temperature has actually leveled off.   I am going to site Dr. Done Easterbrook, who is a climate scientist. Back in 2000 he predicted that Earth was entering a cooling phase. He predicts that for the next 20 years Earth will cool by 3/10 degree each year and that we are going to enter another little Ice Age like we did from 1650 and 1790. The funny thing is that many of my opponent's charts are actually from the incorrect IPPC.  How about the 'Hockey Stick' graph that many Global Warming supporters , including my opponent, argue about? Well if we observe the fallowing chart taken from Northern Scandenavia we can see that the Global trend over the past 1,000 years that the Global Cooling trend slope is that of -0.31 Degrees Celcuis, give or take 0.03 degrees (for the error room). Professor Dr. Jan Esper has found that the Earth's temperature of Earth actually decreases 0.3 per millenia due to the Earth moving away from the sun. Here is another graph from 1920 to 2005 and we can see that the graph has a negative temperature slope, thus meaning that the Earth is under a period of cooling.Contention 3: Artic Ice. First, I would like to state that Pro's claim about the North Pole completely melting is bogus.  Al Gore stated that the Artic Ice would be completely melted by 2014, but he is incorrect then and now.   Jan. 6, 2012: The Coast Guard Cutter Healy breaks ice around the Russian-flagged tanker Renda 250 miles south of Nome. The Healy is the Coast Guard’s only currently operating polar icebreaker. The vessels are transiting through ice up to five-feet thick in this area. The 370-foot tanker Renda will have to go through more than 300 miles of sea ice to get to Nome, a city of about 3,500 people on the western Alaska coastline that did not get its last pre-winter fuel delivery because of a massive storm. Let's go back to 2007-2008 and see if his claim was justified in the Artic Ice activity.  Hmmm... It seems that he is incorrect, but let's look further into the near past. How about 2012-2013? We all remember the Climate Scientists that got stuck in Arctic Ice Earlier this year correct? Then a Russian Ice Breaker tried to free them, but got stuck. Can you guess what they were studying? They had predicted that all the Arctic Ice had melted due to Global Warming and that Earth would get flooded massively. Boy were they wrong. How about Al Gore. The man who brought Global Warming to our attention? In 2009, the man breaks down in tears stating how it's nothing, but hot air and how he fabricated everything just for the money! He said the arctic sheets are not melting and CO2 is not responsible for depletion of the Ozone. Dr. Koonin, former head of the Department of Energy under President Obama, has stated that the Global Warming scare is not suttle. This is because that he has found 3 things wrong and highly incorrect about the scare. 1. Shrinking of Artic Sea ice doesn't acount for the gaining of the Antartic ice. 2. The warming of Earth's temps today is the same as it was 30 years ago. 3. The sea levels rose at the same height and rate in the 20th cenury. Contention 4: Sea Levels  Here is another corralation that must happen. If the Ice Caps are completely melted as Pro claims then the sea level would have risen completely drowning tons of land.  The graph above is raw satellite image data of the sea level rise over an 8 year period showing that there is little to no change in the Sea Levels rising. The sea level rises, on average, about 3 inches per century and it has been found to not even been rising at all.  This graph is the sea levels off the cost of French Guyana which is one of the areas which is predicted to be flooded due to Global Warming, but as you can see by the graph (which goes to 2008) the sea level is currently on a downward trend.</t>

    <t>Global warming is significantly man man made  Here is a general website that debunks anti man made global warming folks, claim by claim  Here is proof that carbon dioxide has nearly doubled and increased exponentially since the industrial revolution. Here is a similar graph that shows temperature following a similar fate. Here are websites that tie together co2 and temperature, and debunks any claims about why co2 and temperature carbon are not always tightly correlated. There's no question that temperature and CO2 is correlated. You can see that in the links i provided, historically. Here is that they are more than just correlated, but tied together.  Here is a graph showing the thickness of polar caps melting exponentially. Here is a scientific article that refers to the ice caps being doomed. Warming not caused by volcanoes and the Sun cycles. The volcano theorists can't even keep their stories straight. In his book, Limbaugh claims that the 1991 Pinatubo eruption put 1000 times as much chlorine into the atmosphere as industry has ever produced through CFCs; yet on Nightline, Pinatubo is alleged to have produced 570 times the equivalent of one year's worth of CFCs. Both can't be right. It turns out neither are. The figure 570 apparently derives from Ray's book--but she said it was Mount Augustine, an Alaskan volcano that erupted in 1976, that put out 570 times as much chlorine as one year's worth of CFCs. Ray's source is a 1980 Science magazine article--but that piece was actually talking about the chlorine produced by a gigantic eruption that occurred 700,000 years ago in California (Science, 6/11/93).' '--------- I'd also add, that the common sense answer to me is... consider all the smoke stacks out there. Consider all the pollution, places like LA. I'd bet California itself is like a volcano very short period in intervals. doesn't this make the most sense, considering how little and how infrequent volcanoes erupt? ----------  Scientific article saying the sun is only accounting for a third of our warming ------------- QUOTE With respect to global warming, though solar activity has been at relatively high levels during the recent period, the fact that solar activity has been near constant during the last 30 years precludes solar variability from playing a large role in recent warming. It is estimated that the residual effects of the prolonged high solar activity account for between 18 and 36% of warming from 1950 to 1999  ^ Stott, Peter A.; Gareth S. Jones and John F. B.

We are setting records at a more frequent basis. -If we look at natural temperature increases... we see we've been increasing for thousands of years. But, we see that it's been accelerating in recent history, particularly the industrial revolution where pollution occurs. This is in reference to the infamous 'hockey stick' graph. No, we can't deduce from that alone that we're the cause, but we can give it as supporting the fact that there's an accelerated increase, especially at our time. -Studies have been done that show CO2 being a cause of warming. we might squabble about how much warming, but we know it causes some.</t>
