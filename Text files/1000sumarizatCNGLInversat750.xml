    <t>Round 2IntroductionFirst off, I would like to thank my opponent for displaying interest in this debate. I am eager to debate such an experienced member of this site. For my argument I would first off like to define a few terms as it is likely that they will be used several times by both debaters. Global warming: a gradual increase in the overall temperature of the earth's atmosphere.Greenhouse effect: the trapping of the sun's warmth in a planet's lower atmosphere.Carbon Dioxide (CO2): a colorless, odorless gas produced by burning carbon and organic compounds and by respiration.Fossil Fuels: a natural fuel such as coal or gas, formed in the geological past from the remains of living organisms.With the definitions aside, let the debating begin!How does the greenhouse effect work? Before I begin defending the premise defined in the first round, I would like to clarify how the process called the greenhouse effect works. This is essential to the topic of global warming, as the greenhouse effect is the process which warms the planet, especially during the nigh time. When sunlight reaches the earths atmosphere it changes into thermal radiation. Most of this thermal radiation is reflected off back into space due to the earth's atmosphere, however some manages to enter the planet. Once it reaches the atmosphere, it comes down to the surface, still as light, and is converted into energy through the process of photosynthesis. Eventually this energy is transferred from the plant to a primary or secondary consumer when the plant/producer is eaten by the consumer. Due to a concept called the 10% rule, almost all of the energy (90%) is lost during the transfer from producer to consumer and is radiated back into the atmosphere as heat [1]. Some of this heat manages to leave the atmosphere and goes off to space where it becomes essentially useless. A small percent of the heat, however, is trapped by the greenhouse gases (such as CO2, CH4, N2O, etc) and is kept in the atmosphere [2]. This is important because during the nigh time when the sun is not providing heat, the heat preserved by the greenhouse gases keep the planets surface warm [3]. This generally should be considered a good thing, however in this case there can be to much of a good thing. Due to the fact that there is now an abundance of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, especially carbon dioxide, too much heat is being trapped in the atmosphere and as a result global temperatures have risen. I will attempt to prove that the reason for this abundance of greenhouse gases and as a result increased global temperatures is a result of human actions, and it is not a 'natural' occurrence. Graph A shows the basic process of the greenhouse effect. Graph A: Argument structureMy argument will follow this basic format: P1) The increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is a result of human actions. P2) Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes an increase in global temperatures. P3) Therefore human beings are responsible for global warming. P1) The increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is a result of human actions. This is not a very difficult subject to defend and consequently it is not a very controversial subject, therefore I will be brief. Since the industrial revolution in the mid 1800's more and more carbon dioxide has been released into the atmosphere. Graph B shows the rapid increase in carbon emmisions starting in 1850. Graph B:The reason for this is obvious, due to rapid increasing of industry and technology, burning of fossil fuels has become more and more frequent. Due to the fact that the burning of fossil fuels emits carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, it is also obvious that the increased amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is a result of human activity. P2) Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes an increase in global temperatures. This is a much more controversial subject, and therefore I will spend the majority of my argument in this section. Given that the greenhouse effect states that greenhouse gases trap heat, and re radiate it in all directions, as shown in Graph A, it would be easy to make the assumption that if there is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere there would be less long wave radiation (the type of heat that CO2 absorbs) being emitted into space and more infrared radiation being emitted back to the earth. This, as a result, would heat up the world and cause global warming. To prove this hypothesis, NASA launched the IRIS satellite in 1970 to record the amount of long wave radiation being emitted into space over a 26 year period [4]. What they found supported the hypothesis that less long wave radiation was being emitted into space and as result their was more infrared being contained in the earth. Graph C displays the results of the experiment.Graph C:This graph is an infrared spectrum and it shows the frequencies of infrared light (800 to 1600 cm-1). The graph has multiple greenhouse gases (such as CO2 and CH4) and based on their position on the graph, it determines the frequency of infrared light that they absorb. For example CO2 is at the far end of the spectrum because it absorbs lower frequency light than CH4 (methane), which is at the far end of the spectrum. The graph shows the difference of the amount of infrared radiation that is being absorbed by the various greenhouse gases between 1970 and 1996. Due to the fact that there is a greater variation in both CO2 and CH4 it shows that there is more radiation being absorbed by those two gases. In simpler terms, this shows that there is more heat being trapped by carbon dioxide and methane then there used to in the past, and therefore as a result global warming is a result of the carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere. If these gases are the cause of global warming than it can also be determined that human beings are the cause of global warming because they are the ones that are emitting the CO2 and CH4 into the atmosphere. Moving on to the next graph, Graph D is representing the amount of infrared radiation at the earth's surface. Graph D:This graph is somewhat less complex than Graph C (thankfully). What it is representing is once again the infrared radiation spectrum (600-1800 cm-1) and the greenhouse gases that trap the radiation at certain spectrums. CO2 is found and approximately 800 cm-1 and consequently there is a much higher amount of infrared radiation at 800 cm-1 at the earths surface than there is of any other wave frequency. What this means is that carbon dioxide is responsible for the majority of the heat being contained in the earth. By extension, this means that carbon dioxide is causing global warming and that it is once again human beings fault due to the fact that we are the ones emitting the CO2 into the atmosphere. Now moving on to the final graph. Graph E is showing both the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and also the global temperatures. Graph E:What Graph E is conveying is that there is a huge amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere currently, much higher than there has ever been in the past. Now there are three important things to note in this graph. One is that throughout the course of history, whenever global temperatures increased, the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere had increased as well. This allows us to reach the conclusion that the more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the higher temperatures will be. The second thing to note is that in none of the historical situations did global temperatures increase at the exact same time that the carbon dioxide levels. In every situation the temperatures took several years to rise following an increase in carbon dioxide levels. This is important because it shows global warming skeptics, like my opponent, that global temperatures will not increase right away. This is why temperatures have not increased so rapidly yet, however given the trend of this graph they are certain to increase in the near future. The final thing to note is the huge amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today. In no situation in history has their been such a high amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and the only explanation for why this is is human activity. Global warming skeptics claim that we cannot know that it is human being fault for global warming, however this chart shows the contrary. P3) Therefore humans are responsible for global warmingI have proved that carbon dioxide is the primary reason for why their has been increases in global temperatures as of late. This negates skeptics major arguments about why global warming is not human beings fault because it is clear that carbon dioxide emittions are due to human beings, and therefore it can be concluded that human beings are the cause of global warming.</t>
<h>    Given that the greenhouse effect states that greenhouse gases trap heat, there is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere there would be less long wave radiation being emitted into space and more infrared radiation being emitted back to the earth.</h>

    <t>Round 3Contention 1: Increased CO2 levels are from human actionThere are two issues regarding my opponents argument, which I will address. 1) How can anthro account for such a rapid spike in carbon dioxide levels? The primary argument that global warming skeptics present for the increase in carbon dioxide levels is that it is a natural occurrence. The issue with this argument is that throughout the 4.5 billion years in which the earth has existed the carbon dioxide levels have never spiked so rapidly [1]. It is unlikely that such a drastic change in the earth's atmosphere would only occur one in 4.5 billion years. Graph F displays the rapid increase of carbon dioxide levels. Graph F:2) Industrial Revolution correlation Using Graph B from the first round as reference, it is shown that the spike of carbon dioxide levels correlates flawlessly with the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the mid 1800's. I would like to ask my opponent, is it simply a coincidence that this is the case? In my opinion, find this incredibly unlikely. Dr. Roy Spencer has not addressed either of these issues with his hypothesis, and therefore I conclude that we should not consider Dr. Spencer's research as legitimate. Contention 2: CO2 in the atmosphere causes increased temperatures. Acknowledging that carbon dioxide traps heat, and yet it has no correlation with increased global temperatures is both illogical and not scientific. Noting that global temperatures have always increased when carbon dioxide levels increase, how does my opponent explain the increase of global temperatures this time? Also, arguing that global temperatures have been hotter in the past makes no sense. This is due to the fact that the earth was once essentially a ball of fire. For the case of the graph, however, the global temperatures that are 7.5 degrees Celsius higher than the present were during a time of natural warming. Modern days, we are technically in an ice age. This makes it even more impressive that are temperatures are increasing, and while it is possible that it is simply a natural interglacial period, however I will disprove this using Graph G. Graph G:This graph shows the global temperatures for the past 400,000 years. In every single interglacial period, the temperatures drop nearly instantly after the spike. However in the modern 'interglacial period' the high temperatures have remained high and have not dropped following a spike. This implies that this is not a natural interglacial period and therefore must be considered that it is occurring due to human influence. As for Dr. Don Eastbrook, I don't understand how he can claim that the earth is cooling while every graph suggests the contrary. For Dr. Jan Esper, does this not support global warming? If the earth is supposed to naturally cool, then how can it be explained that the earth is warming? It suggests that the earth is warming due to human actions as opposed to natural reasons. For the graph presented, it is a generic graph which global warming skeptics often present. The problem with this graph is that the information is skewed to support the claim that the earth is cooling. Graph H represents how skeptics skew the data while Graph I presents how global warming believers view the data. Graph H:Graph I:In Graph H, it is clear that the temperature pattern is increasing, however skeptics take a very small portion of the graph to 'prove' that temperatures are decreasing. Graph I shows a more accurate representation of how global temperatures should be graphed. The arctic ice increase is a far more controversial subject, however. There are two theories for why the sea ice is increasing, despite global warming. One theory involves an increase in wind due to the hole in the ozone layer. The theory states that with increased wind, the wind pushes more ice out into the ocean. Due to the ice being farther out in the ocean then the surrounding water cools and therefore freezes. This theory relies on global warming due to the fact that the increased winds are a result of ozone depletion, which is a result of increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere [2]. The second theory also relies on global warming, more specifically, increased sea levels. With an increased amount of warm water, the ice in the poles melts faster. This adds cool, fresh water into the ocean, which while does not lower temperatures to a freezing point, does create conditions suitable for freezing. Therefore, if temperatures decrease enough, the ocean will freeze over rapidly and farther out than in most situations [3]. In both of these situations, the increase in arctic ice relies on global warming, therefore disproving my opponents hypothesis that global warming cannot exist. As for Al Gore, he obviously doesn't know what he is talking about, based on my and other scientists arguments.</t>
<h>    The primary argument that global warming skeptics present for the increase in carbon dioxide levels is that it is a natural occurrence.</h>

    <t>I thank my opponent for giving me this chance to debate this with him. I will leave you a funny political cartoon about Global Warming before we get started.  Contention 1: Increased CO2 levels are from Human Action Here I shall actually be arguing that a great amount of CO2 levels are actually anthro, thus meaning that his increase in CO2 is natural.  In a recent study done by Dr. Roy Spencer, he has found that the atmospheric temperature is more likely coming from anthropogenic CO2 rising up from sinks. He found that the above model is consitant of 61% anthropogenic, 22% ocean temperature, and finially 17% land temperature which accounts for the CO2 emmissions from Fossil Fuels. The above graph shows that comparisions of C13 (Carbon isotope) and this shows that there is little to no trend pertrade in many of these as the average is zero while the trend for all of these are zero. Contention 2: C02 in the atmosphere causes Increased Temperatures. I agree that CO2 can absorb heat, but I shall be arguing that there is no corralation here between increased CO2 and Increased Temperatures.  If we observe the above graph we can see that Earth has been a whole lot hotter than where we currently are to the point where the Earth's average temperature has been 7.5 degrees Celcuis hotter than it currently it is. You can also see that in the span of the past 10,000 years the temperature has leveld off, but you may ask yourself where does that place us in the lights of modern day?  I am going to site Dr. Done Easterbrook, who is a climate scientist. Back in 2000 he predicted that Earth was entering a cooling phase. He predicts that for the next 20 years Earth will cool by 3/10 degree each year and that we are going to enter another little Ice Age like we did from 1650 and 1790. How about the 'Hockey Stick' graph that many Global Warming supporters argue about? Well if we observe the fallowing chart taken from Northern Scandenavia we can see that the Global trend over the past 1,000 years that the Global Cooling trend slope is that of -0.31 Degrees Celcuis, give or take 0.03 degrees (for the error room). Professor Dr. Jan Esper has found that the Earth's temperature of Earth actually decreases 0.3 per millenia due to the Earth moving away from the sun. We all remember the Climate Scientists that got stuck in Arctic Ice Earlier this year correct? Then a Russian Ice Breaker tried to free them, but got stuck. Can you guess what they were studying? They had predicted that all the Arctic Ice had melted due to Global Warming and that Earth would get flooded massively. Boy were they wrong. Heck even the Artic ice is growing. The Artic ice also increased from 2012-2013 as well. How about Al Gore. The man who brought Global Warming to our attention? In 2009, the man breaks down in tears stating how it's nothing, but hot air and how he fabricated everything just for the money! He said the arctic sheets are not melting and CO2 is not responsible for depletion of the Ozone.  Dr. Koonin, former head of the Department of Energy under President Obama, has stated that the Global Warming scare is not suttle. This is because that he has found 3 things wrong and highly incorrect about the scare. 1. Shrinking of Artic Sea ice doesn't acount for the gaining of the Antartic ice. 2. The warming of Earth's temps today is the same as it was 30 years ago. 3. The sea levels rose at the same height and rate in the 20th cenury.  Contention 3: Therefore humans are not responsable for Global Warming. I have shown that there is no trend between CO2 and tempterature rising. I have show that the Earth is actually cooling and that the current supposed rise that my opponent is talking about is actually from anthropogenics. Thus this resolution is negated.</t>

    <t>Contention 1: CO2 increase from humans  My opponent states that CO2 levels have never been this high, but that is incorrect. I give you the above graph measuring the past 600 million years of CO2 levels are we are actually at an all time low. Now the website I got this from no longer has this page up so I appologize. We can see from observance of this graph that we being at all time CO2 low levles that we are nowhere close to meeting the impact that my opponent brings up. We have been over 5,000 ppm of CO2 in our atmosphere and are now currently around apprx. 350 ppm CO2 levels.  This chart above shows the CO2 and Earth's temperatures for the past 600 million years. My opponent's claims are incorect as we have had aburd levels of CO2 and temperature on Earth and may I ask how did we survive that? My opponent tries to discard Dr. Spencer's evidence, because he doesn't appear to have a hypothesis, but that is not grounds to disqualify evidense as his findings were clear, so I extend them across the board.   Contention 2: CO2 in atmosphere = increased temperatures. My opponent is under a great misconceptions as I acknowledge that CO2 traps heat, but I am simply arguing that Earth's temperature is not increasing, but is actually decreasing. To counter my opponent's first graph I'll reitterate my first graph of C2 in my last round. To see what my opponent does not show you is that the span between 0 AD- Present and you'll see an almost constant temperature. Humans have been on Earth for millions of years and the fact that it's nearly constant from a non-industrial era where there were no machines what-so-ever to present shows that there is no major change that my opponent change. My opponent question Dr. Eastbrock, but brings up no valid counterevidence other than Dr. Esper. Dr. Eastbrook naturally cools and ever since 2000 we have been in a cooling range. We have also seen how the IPP projections are incorrect. My opponent then tries to blatantly claim that Global Warming evidence that I have provided is skewed, but if that is true let's look at a graph from 1975 to 2010 it appears to have a positive slope, but let's back track a little back and make it a 1920-2005 graph since it would seem that it would only make the graph appear to have a steeper positive slope, right? Well that is where we are wrong.  Here we see that the graph protrays a negative slope. My opponent now brings up one theory relying on the Ozone hole and southern winds, but this is incorrect as the World Health Organization (WHO) has found that the Ozone is actually getting thicker and is expected to make a great recovery by 2025 due to the banning of Hydrocarbons. The graph above is raw satellite image data of the sea level rise over an 8 year period showing that there is little to no change in the Sea Levels rising. (The sea level rises, on average, about 3 inches per century and it has been found to not even been rising at all.  This graph is the sea levels off the cost of French Guyana which is one of the areas which is predicted to be flooded due to Global Warming, but as you can see by the graph (which goes to 2008) the sea level is currently on a downward trend. The source is the PDF within the link. I have disproved both situations. Gore is one of the many who spread great awareness for Global Warming and he won the Nobel Peace Prize for it, but hen admitted that it's a scam to get money. That's a same. THank you for a great debate and please vote Con.</t>

    <t>I thank my opponent for their opening round. While I'll make some general comments as to the trend of the debate, I will refrain from posting actual rebuttals until the subsequent round, as per the Instigator's rules.I am actually astounded at the position presented. I was expecting graphs, tables and data. Instead, we have been presented a point of view, which is axiomatic of the anti-climate change position. We have been presented an opinion. To open my case, let me make something robustly clear. Science does not function on the basis of opinion, and to present opinion is to concede evidence. Science is apolitical.As it stands, I agree with Pro on one point: don't follow the crowd. Instead, follow the peer-reviewed scientific literature. I take substantial grievance with the sources provided by Pro but unfortunately am constrained by the rules not to explain their absurdity until the following round. Rest assured that they will be thoroughly scrutinised and I intend to tear them apart.Onto the evidence. It's not two-sidedThe popular Western narrative is to provide 'unbiased coverage' of stories. In most cases, this is important. However, on science topics, opinion has nothing to do with anything. Facts are facts. Something is either true, or not true, and the only thing that we can use to determine whether something is true is evidence. To have two people on a talk-show, one a climate scientist and one an ostensible nobody claiming that climate scientists are the devil's children and work for multinationals is patently absurd because it misrepresents the scientific consensus (discussed below). It is not a 50/50 split. Evidence favours anthropogenic climate change, and stuffing our fingers in our ears will not refute this. If you want to disprove climate change, you must use evidence.ConsensusOf course, it would be an argument from popularity to stipulate that purely because the majority thinks something, it is true. It amounts to a special form of anecdotal evidence. However, it's a good place to start looking at why the independent scientific community agrees. As it happens, 97% of peer-reviewed papers published on the topic have found that humans are causing substantial changes to climate (1). The scientific community is clear. There is no 'teaching the controversy' because there is no controversy (2). Stop making science political because agendas don't change facts.Yeah, but, like, the climate has changed before and stuff...or whateverTrue. But not like this (3). It appears that there have been around 5 ice ages in earth's past (4). There have also been other variations in climate not related to ice ages. However, let's talk about anthropogenic climate change. The hypothesis is that as CO2 increases, we should see a general increase in global temperatures. Is this the case?Well, it would appear so. But have statistical controls accounted for extraneous variables and clarified that this is anthropogenic?Well, yeah, they kinda have. Despite attempts at finding plausible natural explanations for the climate variation, no natural fluctuations account for the observed trends (5).Rounding offThe scientific illiteracy of climate conspiracy theorists is a fundamental contributor to their perpetuation of the disinformation agenda of the corporate elite. While I obviously have substantially more evidence and could potentially just post hundreds of links to peer-reviewed journals, I prefer the argumentation. Perhaps this is sufficient for my introduction, and we'll clash next round with increased vigour when I can rebut your arguments.Best of luck in your following round.</t>

    <t>I personally am for the fact that man-made global warming does not exist, and that the earth is simply going through an ice age. Let me explain, an ice age goes through two phases. The first one is the obvious 'freezing' phase and the second phase is a predominantly warm one(see link 1). We are obviously in the predominantly warm phase, but going back into the cold phase. At both poles there is rapidly growing ice. I as a conservative taking the harder side to argue must work very hard to convince the public, while my partner must simply keep them on his side.

    <t>My opponent concedes that man-made global warming is, in fact, real.While at this point I would usually proceed by simply extending my previous arguments until the end of the debate, I feel that particularly poor sportsmanship has been demonstrated by my opponent. Far from constructing baseless ad hominem conjectures against my opponent, I simply deconstructed common mistakes regarding anthropogenic climate change that are made by climategate proponents. My opponent does not genuinely feel disrespected; they recognise that their position is untenable and that the belief that has been instilled in them by their right-wing, science-hating parents does not reflect anything close to observation. You're not offended; you just know you're wrong.My objective is now not to convince you, which I have already done, but to convince our audience. Rebuttals from first roundMy opponent stated that, '[...]an ice age goes through two phases. The first one is the obvious 'freezing' phase and the second phase is a predominantly warm one(see link 1).'While this isn't quite what the source indicates, it's basically right. There are periods of glaciation, and periods of warming. Cooling and warming are not uniform. I'd just like to quickly examine the way you've phrased this, though. Basically you're saying, it gets cold, then it gets warm. Well, obviously. If it stayed cold, we'd still be in an ice age. If it stayed warm, there'd never be ice ages. That's not helpful information.You then say, '[we are] going back into the cold phase.' Erm, nope.  I mean, we are getting cooler...if by cooler, you mean the temperature is rising.You then said, 'At both poles there is rapidly growing ice.'Your article goes on a right-wing binge-fest with absolutely no understanding of why that is happening. It makes specific reference to Antarctica. Yes. Sea ice is growing. This is because of strengthening westerly winds blowing sheets of snow and cold air further from the coast of the Antarctic continent(1). The strengthening winds are one indication of climate change(1). Further, while the sea ice spreads in geographic area, global ocean and atmospheric temperatures continue to increase. Looking at the data for a single year (i.e. we hit a record this year) is not indicative of trend. This mistake is confusing weather for climate, and is a common error. You're also looking at a single factor in isolation, and ignoring the rest of the data.Here's an informative video by Veritasium who describes the process and debunks some myths with the aid of some fun animations. The preponderance of the evidenceThe preponderance of the evidence, the consensus of the scientific literature, the data: 'The Earth’s climate is changing rapidly as a result of anthropogenic carbon emissions, and damaging impacts are expected to increase with warming' (Knutti amp; Hegerl, 2008)(2).Once again, if you wish to demonstrate that the models are incorrect, then you must supply the evidence that climate change is not occurring. Your reasons for doubting the science are political. Wanting something to be true or false has no bearing on whether it is true or false. Environmental refugeesWe are going to see floods of environmental refugees as a result of rising sea levels. How can one simply ignore this information?- The pacific island nation of Kiribati has just finalised the purchase of land in Fiji to initially grow crops on after their domestic agriculture was destroyed by encroaching seawater, then as a place to relocate once their entire country sinks(3). New Zealand will have to grant the population what functionally amounts to environmental asylum.- Tuvalu is going to sink and the population will need evacuating (4, 5)- This is just the start of implications for changes to the climate.Summing upMy opponent had the burden of proof in demonstrating that global warming is a hoax. This has not yet been done, and if last round is anything to go by, I suspect my opponent will concede defeat. However, it would be interesting to hear his take. So, I ask you the following questions:- What is your evidence for the hoax?- Who initiated the hoax?- Why did they initiate it? What's the motive?- How is it the case that the independent scientific community, meteorologists and government bodies have separately and through peer-review arrived at the same or similar conclusions? If it was false, wouldn't the claims be widely varying?- Who is the chief orchestrator of this grand conspiracy? They must have a leader since all their claims are the same.- Is their really more profit to be found by scientists conducting research, than by massive oil cartels, coal and gas miners, and refiners and importers? Is renewable energy really going to earn more money for solar-cell syndicates than fossil fuels will for the energy industry?Perhaps the conspiracy is, in fact, on the other side. Until next round, if you decide to defend your position.</t>

    <t>In response to the claimed censorship.1.     The accusation about the censorship of opposing views on the FDR forums is not sourced or justified, and from a quick look at the forums it seems that the opposite is the case. It can be seen that Stefan is open to differing opinions, and respects them if they are presented in a calm and non-aggressive manner. This forum thread {1} is an example of a post in which Stefan is directly said to be wrong on an important issue, and, in it, Stefan replies with, quote, “Thank you so much for the information, I had no idea, I really appreciate you sharing, I will have a look in detail[.]”2.     Most, if not all, of the videos in the playlist you linked that were taken down as a result of copyright claims by FDR only consisted of the audio from FDR shows with occasional captioning and commentary in text-form. These videos clearly violate copyright law, and, regardless of Stefan’s opinion on IP rights, it cannot be said that taking them down is “suppressing dissent” or is “cultlike behaviour”. At worst, you are accusing him of being a hypocrite – that does not help you in fulfilling your BOP.      In response to the “Insane/Cultish Claims”  1.  Just for the record, Stefan has publically recanted his views on homosexuality that you mentioned {2}.                                  2.   The majority of the claims on your list are just said to be “insane/cultish”, with no justification as to why this is so (and, with your definition of “cult leader”, I don’t see how any of these directly support the idea that FDR is a cult), just that they are supported by Molyneux. No reasons are given for most of the claims as to why they aren’t valid, as if they are just to be accepted as being such because of some self-evident nature they possess. Even if they were completely and utterly debunked, it would be irrelevant to the debate – one is not a “cult leader”, even by the definition given by PRO, just because they support unorthodox or irrational ideas. As such, these videos do nothing to further the fulfillment of the BOP by PRO, and I do not need to respond any further to them.     In response to Stefan’s support of DEFOO-ing I must ask, if the idea of DEFOO-ing is cult-like, would it not follow that most of the modern western world would be cultists? Stefan does NOT universally support DEFOO-ing - he does not want all children to disassociate themselves from their families. He advocates doing so in the cases of emotional or physical abuse – this is to be done for the child’s own sake, not in order for them to be “better devoted” to Molyneux or whatever other sinister theory. Molyneux is applying the concept of a battered spouse leaving the abuser to familial relationships. There is nothing more “cult-like” about this than there is about women supporting that wives who are being consistently harmed should leave the source of the harm, if they can. It is baseless to assert that Stefan is a cult-leader because of this.</t>

    <t>According to the website culteducation.com here are the warning signs for a cult leader:  Absolute authoritarianism without meaningful accountability. No tolerance for questions or critical inquiry. No meaningful financial disclosure regarding budget, expenses such as an independently audited financial statement. Unreasonable fear about the outside world, such as impending catastrophe, evil conspiracies and persecutions. There is no legitimate reason to leave, former followers are always wrong in leaving, negative or even evil. Former members often relate the same stories of abuse and reflect a similar pattern of grievances. There are records, books, news articles, or television programs that document the abuses of the group/leader. Followers feel they can never be 'good enough'. The group/leader is always right. The group/leader is the exclusive means of knowing 'truth' or receiving validation, no other process of discovery is really acceptable or credible.  Now lets go through these one by one.  'Absolute authoritarianism without meaningful accountability.'  Now it is difficult for Molyneux to engage in as authoritarian practises as the FDR cult isn't under one roof. However Molyneux defiantly doesn't support any meaningful diversity of opinion or forgiveness of past actions which went against the message of the cult, I don't think this covers but it is close.  'No tolerance for questions or critical inquiry.'  Any questions posed to Molyneux are quickly censored [1].  'No meaningful financial disclosure regarding budget, expenses such as an independently audited financial statement.'  If Molyneux has ever published a budget I am yet to find it.  'Unreasonable fear about the outside world, such as impending catastrophe, evil conspiracies and persecutions.'  Lets say that if anything counts it's this [2] in this video Molyneux claims that all his followers should remove themselves from relations and friends who are not adherents to the non aggression principle (which I accept) because all non adherents will want to kill you.  'There is no legitimate reason to leave, former followers are always wrong in leaving, negative or even evil.'  I can't find anything on this.  'Former members often relate the same stories of abuse and reflect a similar pattern of grievances.'  If my opponent denies this I suggest he look in the comments section of this debate otherwise here is a forum of ex FDR members discussing their experiences [3].  'There are records, books, news articles, or television programs that document the abuses of the group/leader.'  Here are some [4] [5].  'The group/leader is always right.'  Other than a few inconsequentially's Molyneux more or less claims constant and unquestionable integrity [6].</t>

    <t>Resolved: That Global Warming is not significantly affected by humans I thank the opponent for the debate challenge. As the opponent has not defined any terms, the definition of the terms shall go as follows: Global Warming: Noun The unequivocal rise of the global average temperature; also attributed to the unpredictable climate in the world. [1] Significantly: Adverb In a sufficiently great or important way as to be worthy of attention. [2] Humans: Noun Mankind, homo-sapiens,  Affected: Adjective  Influenced or touched by an external factor. [2]   Since this debate resolution is a normative resolution, the Burden of Proof is shared. For the opponent to win, he has to prove that humans have almost no responsibility in causing global warming.   With this said, the introduction and the proof that global warming exists shall be shared first, as this debate cannot go on with the assumption that it exists, as assumptions are inherently detrimental.    Axiom One: Global Warming Necessarily Exists   Global warming is no longer a possibility, but it is indeed a necessity. There has been an increase of 0.8 degrees Celsius in the last 100 years, with 0.7 degrees Celsius of this increase happening in the last 30 years [3]. From 1880, the temperature of the world was recorded via NASA meteorological stations; this data proved vital in identifying a change in temperature. From 1980 upwards, one can see a very high increase in the mean temperature of the world; the running average of global temperature from 1980 has increased by almost 100%.    This graph, compiled by NASA GISS from data provided by many sources, confirms that Global Warming necessarily exists, as can be seen via the sharp increase of the running average from 1980.   Global Warming exists; there is no doubt. Then what causes Global Warming? It is us, humans, that cause Global Warming.   Proposition One: Carbon Dioxide Release from Multiple Sources    Global warming has been allegedly caused by an excess of Co2 release from the ocean and multiple other sources. Accordingly in 2000, 29.5% of Co2 emissions came from power stations, 20.6% from Industrial Inputs/Outputs, 11.3% from residences and 9.1% from land use/biomass. [4] In 2008, 8.37 billion tons of Co2 was released from multiple of human based sources. However, one might object; “what’s wrong with the increase in release of Co2?”  of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide – act as a thermal blanket for the Earth, absorbing heat and warming the surface to a life-supporting average of 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius).' /gt;  Quite simply this; the sun emits ultraviolet radiation and light into the earth as energy. The earth absorbs and the re-emits some of this energy as infrared radiation back. However, greenhouse gases on the atmosphere absorb this temperature and releases it in arbitrary directions; henceforth, the earth is 33 degrees warmer than what it should have been, causing life to exist on this planet. However, this 33 degrees Celsius is the equilibrium; for it to go lower would be positive feedback, as the equilibrium could easily be restored in a short period of time, but for it to go higher would make this positive feedback and would threaten to turn our planet into a “Venus” like planet (not suitable for life). This positive feedback is more dangerous than the negative feedback, for it requires intense study of the origins of the causes. [5][6]   The causes of this release are the anthropocentric human lifestyle. To support our life, we humans have taken means to extract resources from mother nation in a Machiavellian manner. Humans are egoistic, hence the development of Capitalism and the government. From the following graph, we can see a correlation; from 1980, Co2 release sprouted and so did gas production.      If oil production is increasing, then clearly oil is also in demand; the burning of 4 liters of oil creates a shocking 8 kg of Co2. [7] 73 million kg of Co2 is henceforth released by the increase consumption of oil/diesel fuels; with these increases of Co2 emissions from fuel burning and usage alone, we can see that there is no reason to believe that humans are not causing this increase in Co2 emissions.    This graph also shows how the Industrial Revolution, in around 1840, has caused the dramatic rise of Co2 concentration. The Industrial Revolution was the basis of all industries; it revolutionized many industries and increased outputs via machinery. However, the Industrial Revolution had its basis on coal and electricity. Apart from natural gases, coal is also a huge factor in Co2 release. The usage of anthracite coal releases 920g of Co2 per kW/h, whilst the usage of lignite coal releases 990g of Co2 per kW/h. Coal is burnt for one reason only; to supply us with the electricity that runs this computer, this website, and this world. In South Africa, for example, 74% of all Co2 emissions is caused by coal burning; it would be doubtful that if humans were present, this figure would not be present. [8] As stated via the first graph of this proposition’s defense, the correlation between oil production and Co2 released is further supported by the fact that burning fuels for human usage causes the increase in the release of Co2.  Proposition Two: Deforestation  This second proposition is based upon two fundamental premises. 1. Trees absorb Co2 and release oxygen 2. Forest Fires increases Co2 release The first of these two premises is based upon the fact that trees absorb Co2 and release oxygen. This process is called photosynthesis; trees, for so long, have sustained our life through this process.     A single tree can absorb 21kg of Carbon Dioxide! That is enough to absorb the burning of 12 liters of oil! “Only if there were more trees” one would say. [9] The existence of trees means that excess Co2 could be processed and could possibly be eradicated in large amounts. However, deforestation has created a very sad and woeful dilemma for us; we are releasing more Co2 than eve, and yet we are cutting down the mechanisms that fate gave us to counter this Co2 release. It is estimated that 20% of all Co2 in the atmosphere right now would have been absorbed and would be non-existent if it weren’t for massive deforestation. [10]    The second of these premises are based upon the mere process of global warming; the warmer the temperature, the more likelihood of fires turning from small fires to huge fires. Forest fires are one of the most feared disasters in the world. Forest fires, apart from killing a plethora of citizens, can release as much Co2 as cars do. A study was released that demonstrates that in these United States of America, 290 million tones of Co2 was released due to forest fires, which is 4-6% of the entirety of Co2 released during that year. [11] Humans, due to their anthropocentric interests, have caused forest fires to appear more often due to the reckless burning of grass, wood, and other resources can cause forest fires. There is also a considerable amount of cases where forest fires started with someone carelessly dropping a cigarette on the forest grounds.    This evidence shows that humans are highly responsible for the creation of global warming; we are deferring how we absorb Co2 as well as releasing more of it. This is significant in such a manner that this issue cannot be ignored. Our planet will become Venus in the following years if this issued is not cared too.    The resolution is therefore negated. </t>

    <t>'I would like to thank the opponent for his short response.' My opponent points out that my response was significantly shorter in an attempt to make it seem weaker. Length of the response has nothing to do with the quality of it. It's not about the amount of words in your argument, it's about the amount of argument in your words. The main reason why my opponent had such a large argument is because he decided to explain the entire process of global warming, which was completely unnecessary.  In my opponent's second paragraph, he addresses the fact that we 'should've' had an ice age, but we didn't. In this way, my opponent's attempts to debunk my claims. I do not see the point of the paragraph. It is evident from the graph that I provided that cool-downs and peaks do not occur on a perfect 100,000 year schedule, and there are variations, plus or minus 10,000-15,000 years. My opponent also says that 'we are heading towards another Ice Age in the opponent's view'. My argument never centered around Ice Ages. Yes, I believe we are heading towards an Ice Age that will only occur in several more millenniums, but that is not my argument. My argument is that global warming is a naturally occurring process which humans have little to no control over. My opponent must have the graph wrong, because the last ice age occurred less that 50,000 years ago. If so, how in the world was there supposed to be an ice age in the 1950s?  Next, my opponent addresses the CO2 concentrations and shows a little cloud diagram. Although humans pump tons of CO2 into the atmosphere, global temperatures are not changing proportionally. According to my opponent's diagram, volcanic CO2 emissions reach up to 319 million tonnes per year, while human-burned fossil fuels produce 29 billion tonnes a year. That means that humans put out at least 90 times more CO2 into the air than nature does. If we are the cause of global warming, then logically, global temperatures would increase by an enormous factor. But do they? The graph that I provided clearly shows that there has not been any earth-shattering increase in temperature as there should have been when humans are increasing the amount of CO2 from its natural levels by a factor of 90.  The rest of my opponent's argument is also different facts about how much CO2 humans are putting into the atmosphere. I will note that my opponent pays no attention to temperature itself, but only focuses on the changes in CO2 amounts. We are not arguing about CO2, we are arguing global warming, which is the change in temperature, not CO2 concentration. As I proved in the above paragraph, global temperature is not changing proportionally to the amount of CO2 increase, meaning that although there may be a correlation, it is not strong enough to base your entire argument on it.  It so happens that CO2 is not the number 1 greenhouse gas. Water vapor is. Water vapor accounts for up to 70% of the greenhouse effect. Water vapor is everywhere and when its amount increases, so does the global temperature. While CO2 also plays a role, it is minuscule compared to water vapor and humans have no effect on the amounts of water vapor in the atmosphere. This debunks my opponent's entire argument.  Something else that I would like to note is that most/all the graphs my opponent uses are using information about the last 100-200 years. Of course, on those graphs the temperature is actively increasing with CO2 because of how 'zoomed in' they are. If you look on a broader scale (the graph that I provided), it is obvious that CO2 levels cycle just like global temperature, and my opponent simply zoomed in on the peak, so it seems like it is forever increasing.  I will now recap my points and show that humans have little to no impact on global warming.  1. Even though CO2 concentrations have increased by a factor of 90, the temperature has not increased anywhere near that amount, suggesting that there is not such a strong relationship between CO2 and global temperatures. While CO2 does make a difference, the correlation and effect is not strong enough to make any conclusions and base entire arguments on it.  2. The cycle of global warming followed by ice age, followed by another global warming has been going on for hundreds of thousands of years, and we currently reaching the peak of temperature. Humans have little to no impact on this naturally occurring process.  3. CO2 is not the 'biggest' greenhouse gas, water vapor is. Meaning that with an already weak correlation between CO2 and temperature, CO2's impact was just proven even smaller because it is not the only nor most effective greenhouse gas. Water vapor accounts for up to 70% of the greenhouse effect, meaning CO2 accounts for less than 30% of it (because there are many other greenhouse gases such as methane).  As a result of these three main points, I believe it is reasonable to conclude that humans have no significant impact on global temperatures.  Thank you for the good argument.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank the opponent for his short response. Now, in debunking the opponent’s case, we have to observe one thing; accordingly to the Industrial Revolution/Co2 release correlation graph, we can see that the Co2 release has gone outside the main tenants of the normal Co2 equilibrium, which accordingly is around (when effected by negative feedback) 200ppmv. However, we humans now have a ppmv-Co2 rate of 380ppmv, henceforth this may be an offspring, but very unlikely, of huge negative feedback, or it may be the beginning of huge positive feedback in the creation of a new Venus-like Equilibrium.  The opponent mentions the 100,000 years Ice Age Cycle phenomenon; henceforth, we are heading towards another “Ice Age” in the opponent’s view. Firstly, the world’s orbit-tilt, which causes the earth’s temperature to change (as well as volcanoes), are not acting as strong as they were during the last Ice Age. This means that the current Interglacial might be extended by 10,000 years. Apart from this, the plethora of Greenhouse Release, from Co2 and other gasses, outweigh the cooling capacity of the world. If they weren’t, then the world would have been experiencing a period of cool-down, perhaps a mini-Ice Age, from the 1950s. However, as seen, this has not been the case. [1] Apart from this, the opponent’s graph seems to show that in each 100,000 year Ice Age cycles; there has been a natural release of Co2 that has caused a gradual change in temperature. However, scientists know about how this change of temperature came about already. Interglacial epochs were characterized by the balance of Co2 concentration in the air and the Co2 sink in the ocean. There have been occasional times of massive Co2 release rise from volcanic eruptions known as large igneous provinces. These large igneous provinces have been known to cause a sudden change in temperature; however, there are no large igneous provinces that are active. Apart from this, one must observe the fact that today’s volcano does not emit as much Co2 as humans.   In fact, accordingly to the USGS, annually humans generate 130 times more Co2 gas than volcanoes. The opponent is implying that there are natural causes for Co2 and other greenhouse gas release in the world; however, there is a plethora of evidence that suggests the contrary. This data has already been presented. Apart from this, correlation is not causation; because the current Co2 rates in the atmosphere correlates with those of ancient times (which it does not, as already stated), does not mean that this rapid release of Co2 has not been caused by humans. The opponent must observe; there is a difference between gradual change and sudden change. Gradual change implies that the change is made clear gradually. Sudden change is built upon the common knowledge that this change is sudden and unexpected. If this were to have been gradual change, then we humans would have knew about this much later; however, that is not the case.  The opponent seems to argue that this change is normal for the earth; however, we must see that before 1750, Co2 was at a rate of 20ppm in the atmosphere; however, this Co2 rate rose rapidly from 1750, after the industrialization of human capital output capabilities. Now it is at 379ppm, an 18 times increase from the pre-1750 rate. Fossil fuel usage has released 7.2 gigaton of Co2 in 2000-2005. (gigaton-1 billion metric tons). One cannot simply argue that humans do not play a massive role; we are messing with the earth’s ability to absorb Co2 via deforestation, as well as adding 42% more Co2 into the earth’s atmosphere within the last 300 years. Humans have, in a significant manner, effected the overall global temperature.</t>

    <t>You have a good argument, and it is truly disgusting what humans are doing to this Earth, BUT they are not the cause of global warming, as I will argue.  My opponent spends most of his argument explaining the process of global warming, which I find unnecessary, but at least now all the voters know exactly what's going on.  Now, my opponent mentions the greenhouse gases (CO2 in this case) and that with humans, their concentration increases, therefore causing global warming. While humans do, in fact, increase the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere (as my opponent proved), this does not significantly impact the process of global warming. (I request that the voters take a look at this as well)  These graphs clearly show that even hundreds of thousands of years ago, when humans were not pumping CO2 into the atmosphere, the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere and atmospheric temperatures regularly cycled. They peaked about every 100,000 years before dropping back to a minimum. This correlation shows that even without the effect of humans, global warming is a natural process that occurs about every 100,000 years before subsiding once again.  It is evident that humans do not significantly affect the process of global warming and it is only a big deal right now because we are reaching a peak (as shown on the graphs).  I await my opponent's response.</t>

    <t>4R1NRC: On Ice Ages The opponent misinterprets my argument. I have stated that hypothetically, if this were a natural cycle, then the natural cycle would have started the cooling process since 1950; however, this is not the case. Without human involvement, a decline in solar activity and increase surge of volcanic activity should have led to the decrease of earth’s temperature.  The causes of Ice Ages are not fully understood, but the scientific community has agreed on two fundamental facts; one is that greenhouse gases are causing an increase in temperature. This has in turn caused a huge melt in ice in the North and South poles; as stated, this ice loss, accordingly to the theoretical ice age predictions, should have been reversed.  The second fundamental fact that the scientific community has agreed upon is that the dinosaur release of methane was at a correct level for the world to be at a warm environment, or at least an environment worth of life. However, this methane rates are at such low rates when compared to current rates that it would be almost impossible for us to reach an Ice Age in millenniums.  Theory in this case does not correlate with actuality; theory states that humans should be experiencing a decrease in temperature, and increase in Polar Ice Levels. We are experiencing the opposite of that. As the earth’s temperature has been increasing for the last 30 years, and the Polar Ice levels are decreasing, one must understand that this change is not natural. This change can be enacted only via humans, and humans alone caused this. One must understand that for one to reach an interglacial like ours, one would need to go back 430,000 years. Our interglacial interval, called the Holocene, has been in existence for 17,000 years, yet it is experiencing conditions of interglacial periods which have been in existence for 30,000 years. Without significant human involvement, this would have been impossible. 4R2NRC: On Co2 and its effects Before we start dissecting this argument, note that the resolution here is “humans significantly affect global warming” not “humans are the cause of global warming” Although both propositions are true, and is not normally debated; the complete defense of the first proposition is enough for the opponent’s BoP to not be fulfilled. With this in mind, it can be said that Co2 causes a lot of global warming.    Fig One Take this graph for example; this graph shows the amount of Co2 present in the atmosphere, when compared with other greenhouse gasses (excluding water vapor, which shall be touched upon in my next argument). The x-axis shows the radiance, or the amount of radiation that is emitted into the surface. As we can see, the radiance of Co2 is incredibly high in radiance when compared with Carbon Oxide and Dinitrogen Monoxide. Co2 can trap an incredibly high amount of heat and emit it in all directions, more so than many other greenhouse gasses.  With this said, the high increases in Co2 will cause an increase in temperature. Apart from this, the opponent seems to object the 100% increase in the running average of temperature. From 1882, the running average is at about -0.6 degrees Celsius. In the early 2000s, that figure is at 8 degrees Celsius; during the early 1980s, this figure skyrocketed. This is due to the increase consumption of fossil fuels and many other substances, like coal, which has created a huge impact on the temperature of the earth.   This graph demonstrates the sources of human Co2 in the world; albeit one may say that us adding 29 billion g/T to the Carbon Cycle does not affect the Carbon Cycle significantly, this previous proposition can be proven false as the Carbon Cycle is only designed to absorb certain amounts of Co2 and apart from that, humans are destroying the main apparatus of Co2 absorption, which is, naturally, trees! The opponent here accuses me of talking purely about Co2, and not climate change. However, Co2 is the main cause of climate change, as proven by the above graph provided in this contention. Co2, as demonstrated in R1, is one of the most fatal gasses and could cause a huge increase of temperature. Henceforth, the increased in release of Co2 would have caused the huge increase in temperature that humans are experiencing in the last 30 years. Apart from this, one cannot simply state that historically, there has been more Co2 lurking in the atmosphere, because currently we have the most atmospheric Co2 in 800,000 years. If this is not enough, then the opponent would be satisfied in knowing that humans also release an excessive quantity of methane; albeit methane does not linger as long as Co2, its short term effects on the environment are devastating. In a measure of effectiveness in terms of trapping heat, methane traps 120 times more heat than Co2. Methane causes 25% of the current global warming crisis.   The above pie graph shows the sources of methane; as one can see, only 29% of methane releases are from natural causes. Is this not enough evidence to show that humans effectively have a significant effect on global warming? (btw cow fart also release methane) 4R3NRC: On Water Vapor Fig One shows us the radiance of several greenhouse gases excluding water vapor. Why is this? Because indeed, water vapor is the most evident greenhouse gas in the air, with twice as much concentration of water vapor in the air than Co2. Is water vapor the main cause of this crisis? Before we answer that question, two objections must be raised. “It is better safe than sorry” is a classic statement of the old. It is very illogical; perhaps even a non-sequitur, to say that water vapor is the main cause of global warming, so we should release as much Co2 as possible. As stated and demonstrated, Co2 can cause huge climate change within the area of release. Our second objection is this; if water vapor is the cause of global warming, then why are temperatures rapidly rising now? A slow increase can be understood, but a sudden increase cannot. For scientists have such an advanced knowledge that the study of geological structures (of rocks, fossils et all) can prove, quite accurately, the temperatures of the world at stages in history; with this knowledge, theoretical predictions about the earth should be satisfied. However, they are not. This cannot be because of nature, but because of anthropological causes.  With this stated, we must dissect this water vapor case. To assume that Co2 cannot have a significant effect on global warming is illogical; all greenhouse gasses cause global warming. If water vapor is the cause of global warming, then for one degrees Co2 causes to warm the planet, water vapor would cause another degree of this same temperature to rise. However, this is not the case, as Water Vapor causes one degrees Celsius of this warming, whilst Co2 causes three. Apart from this, although water vapor is the most powerful greenhouse gas, its lifetime is relatively short lived; unlike carbon, the earth’s atmosphere allows water vapor to return as substance form in the form of rain. This is done so due to the water cycle; however, the warming caused by Co2 also affects the water cycle, as the warmer the planet gets, the more water vapor is evaporated into the sky, causing a change in temperature and climate throughout the world. In conclusion, Co2 release, methane release, failures in Ice Age prophecies and the increase in release of water vapor due to the increase in anthropogenic Co2 release causes global warming. Because of these reasons, the resolution is negated. Sources: All used from last round</t>

    <t>CO2 has increased by 54% in past 17 years with no global warming, and CO2 theory cannot explain whyNASA data, which I cited in [6], shows there has been no global warming for 17 years. Here is the graph from [6]:Pro argued that the average temperature for each decade has increased for each of the last three decades. That does not contract the fact of there being no global warming for 17 years. Suppose the temperature anomalies were scaled to be 1 in 1980, 2 in 1990, 3 in 2000, and 3 in 2010. Then the decade averages would be 1.5, 2.5, and 3 respectively, with a higher decade average despite no increase in the 2000s. The post-2010 data, which Pro did not consider, also shows no temperature increase. Temperatures rose sharply in the 1990s, so the average for the decade is about half way between the low at the start of the decade and the high at the end. There is no increase from the end of the 90s to the present, so saying the average for 2001 through 2010 is higher than the 90s only says that 90s were warmer at the end of the decade than the beginning. My primary reference for the claim that that IPCC models cannot explain the 17 year lack of global warming is Tinsdale's book “Climate Models Fail” [7]. Tinsdale provides a book length comparison of IPCC model results showing that what actually happened in climate was outside of the error band of model predictions.Tinsdale correctly references Von Storch, but I provided the wrong link, for which I apologize. The Von Storch paper cited by Tinsdale is online, but it can only be accessed with academia.edu membership. Storch says “we find that the continued stagnation in global warming, from 1998 to 2012, is inconsistent with model predictions, even at the 2% confidence level.” Tinsdale also referenced the Mauritsen paper, which I linked in [7]. Like Von Storch, it shows that no reasonable tweak in the IPCC models can bring then into agreement with what actually happened. If CO2 dominated climate in the 20th century, then temperature should have risen monotonically through the century. If fact, there was a sharp decline at the beginning of the century and long gradual decline from about the 40s through the 60s. The general trend is upwards, but a general upward trend is what we would expect if sunspots dominated climate. I presented the sunspot graph previously, but here is a nicer rendition.  Temperature is closely following sunspot activity, but not CO2, through 2000 The continuation, below, shows the pause in global warming post-2000 is consistent with the sunspot cycle having peaked. The 17 year pause in global warming is causing great consternation among scientists who previously believed CO2 predominated. A news report by Voosen summarizes the widespread recognition among scientists that the models are not working, and that some major factors are missing, although among CO2 advocates, there is no agreement among CO2 theorists as to what is wrong. Pro's [5] shows that natural forcing of climate is only a minor part of the model predictions. However, Pro's figure shows is that the model predictions are completely wrong. Temperature was supposed to rise sharply after 2000, as the figure shows, but it did not. Models proved wrong cannot be relied upon for future predictions. As Voosen documents, in the IPCC models, sunspots are only modeled as having a direct irradiance effect, and that effect is negligible for the 20th century through the present. Something else is happening that gives sunspots a much greater influence on climate. Total sea ice is at a high Pro's initial contention was that vanishing Arctic sea ice proves that CO2 dominates climate. That's wrong on two counts. Correlation does not prove causation. Also, global warming is global, so it cannot be that Arctic ice measures warming but Antarctic ice does not. In the last round, Pro changed his position and argued that total ice is important and not sea ice. But total ice has been decreasing since the early 1800s, well before any claim of anthropogenic warming. Total ice shrinking doesn't say anything about the cause. Pro claimed that melting land ice in Antarctica caused the increase in sea ice. That's impossible, because 99.9% of Antarctica has never gotten warm enough for ice to melt. There is a tiny peninsula that goes far enough north to occasionally have some melting, but that's negligible. Future CO2 levels are unknown Pro speculates that once there is any warming from anthropogenic CO2 it will take 10,000 years or even millions of years to correct. Pro agrees that warming causes the release of CO2 from the oceans. That does not address the issue of what future CO2 levels will be. It only says that if there is warming from some cause, that the CO2 levels in the atmosphere would be higher, after some delay, than if CO2 were not released from the ocean. We know it is not the case that warming causes a runaway of temperature due to the release of CO2 causing further warming. The data by Rasmussen [15] shows that CO2 goes up and down following temperature with a lag of a few hundred years, and that is true when either temperatures or CO2 levels are higher than present. It cannot matter whether there was one degree of warming due to sunspots or due to anthropogenic CO2, if any warming were to cause a CO2 induced runaway of temperature, it would have shown up in the temperature and CO2 variation of the past 250,000 years, and it has not happened. All of the IPCC models assume that CO2 levels in the atmosphere are dominated by a continuing exponential rise in anthropogenic CO2. But fossils fuels are unquestionable being exhausted, so it is impossible for CO2 levels from burning fossil fuels to continue to rise exponentially. The only question is when anthropogenic CO2 will fall below the assumed exponential increase. Prof. David Archibald, an expert on fossil fuel reserves claims, “At best, we might get to about 600 ppm ...” [21. p.91] As fossil fuels become scarce the price will rise, which will lead to the use of alternatives like nuclear power, which is present only marginally more expensive than fossil fuels. But let's suppose that the 600 ppm level is reached at the end of the century. That's a 56% increase in CO2. But the 54% increase in CO2 in the past 17 years produced no net increase in global temperature. Because scientists agree CO2 warming is logarithmic, the same percentage increase should produce the same amount of warming. The CO2 warming of the past 17 years was canceled by natural phenomena not in the climate models, so Pro's claim that the climate problem is solved is false. Is 600 ppm total CO2 is the correct number? I don't, and no one knows for sure. The upper limits and the future rates of CO2 production are major unknowns that make it impossible for Pro to meet his burden of proof.Climate prediction based upon solar activity The IPCC model projections of climate depend upon the CO2 effect on warming being multiliplied by a positive factor of two or more by secondary effects, such as the warming increasing water vapor in the atmosphere. Archibald [21. p 1] summarizes: The real world evidence says the opposite. In late 2007, Dr. Roy Spencer of the University of Alabama published a paper analyzing data from the Aqua satellite. Based on the response of tropical clouds, Dr. Spencer demonstrated that the feedback is negative. He calculates a 0.5°C warming for a doubling of the pre-industrial carbon dioxide level. Global warming, as caused by carbon dioxide, is real but it is also minuscule, and will be lost in the noise of the climate system.</t>

    <t>Correlation plus a theory is not proof CO2 dominates climateMy opponent noted temperature generally rising since 1900 and CO2 rising since 1900, and claims that because CO2 is a greenhouse gas, it must be responsible for the rise. The error in that logic is that we do not know how much of the rise is due to CO2 and how much is due to other factors affecting climate. We could plot increasing consumption of charcoal in backyard barbecues, noted that burning charcoal heats the atmosphere, and then concluded that barbecuing causes global warming. The barbecue theory is defeated by showing that there isn't enough heat generated by the volume of charcoal consumed to have a significant warming effect. Similarly, Pro offers no analysis that shows CO2 to be even a significant cause. Pro has the burden to prove not only that CO2 dominated climate in the last century, but that it will dominate the next century despite all unknown factors affecting climate. Here is a reconstruction of CO2 and climate over the past 650 million years. Over geological time, clearly climate has been dominated by factors other than CO2. On the geological time scale, we are currently in an unusual period of low temperatures and low CO2. It a very complicated picture, proving that climate is far more than just CO2. Pro shows the CO2 data for the past 650,000 years.Temperature follows the same pattern, only CO2 follows temperature. If the graphs are time aligned, the result is not that CO2 causes warming. Quite the opposite, CO2 rises about 800 years after temperature rises. Warming causes CO2 because warmer oceans cannot dissolve as much CO2. In 2013 the prestigious journal Nature published an up to date scientific reconstruction of climate for the past 2050 years. It shows that over the period climate varied by about as much as the present warming, with both the Roman Period and the Medieval Warm Period warmer. It remains possible that CO2 is contributing significantly to current warming, but the natural variations are so large that CO2 might be inconsequential. Current climate science has no explanation for the major climate variations of the past 2000 years. That's why the discredited global warming hockey stick attempted to prove there were no past variations. Pro has the burden to prove CO2 dominates. I say it's unlikely CO2 dominates, but no one really knows. Total sea ice is at record levels and CO2 can't explain whyPro argues that arctic ice is melting, that proves CO2 is the cause. Historically, Arctic ice melts when Antarctic ice increases in a cycle of 40 to 60 years called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The PDO pattern fits the cooling period from the 40s to the 70s that CO2 cannot explain. The Arctic was last clear around 1940. Global warming alarmist scientists warned that this time the Antarctic was melting as well, and they made the confident prediction in 2010 was that the Antarctic would be ice free by 2013. What actually happened is that the Antarctic reached record high levels of ice:  “The Antarctic surge is so big that overall, although Arctic ice has decreased, the frozen area around both poles is one million square kilometres more than the long-term average.” If CO2 warming dominates climate, it cannot be that it is overwhelmed by other factors like the PDO. But it is.CO2 theory cannot explain the pause in warming To accurately predict future climate, computer models must be proved to be reliable. We know the models did not predict ice formation in the Antarctic nor pre-1900 climate variations. In addition, global warming has essentially ceased since 1997, so a check on the accuracy of climate models is how well this pause is predicted.  Sscientists predicting CO2 crisis use many variations of computer models. The collections are called CMIP3 and CMIP5, with CMIP5 the very latest. ... Climate models cannot simulate past surface temperatures, precipitation or sea ice area. Those are basic components of Earth’s climate. … The concern about the latest slowdown in warming was addressed by a recent scientific study by Von Storch, et al. (2013) “ Can Climate Models Explain the Recent Stagnation in Global Warming? ” The one-word answer to the title question of their paper is, “No”. They stated: However, for the 15-year trend interval corresponding to the latest observation period 1998-2012, only 2% of the 62 CMIP5 and less than 1% of the 189 CMIP3 trend computations are as low as or lower than the observed trend. Applying the standard 5% statistical critical value, we conclude that the model projections are inconsistent with the recent observed global warming over the period 1998- 2012.  [7. Tisdale, Bob (2013-09-23). Climate Models Fail (Kindle Locations 276-291)] The Von Storch paper is available free in draft format. There are a number of ocean oscillations in addition to the PDO. These are not accurately modelled in the computer simulations and likely account for the rapid warming before the current pause. The Medieval Warm Period and the following Little Ice Age correlate extremely well with sunspot activity, but no physical cause of the warming and cooling has been definitively linked to sunspots so there is nothing in the computer models representing the effects. It is not direct change in the solar radiation, because that varies too little to explain the large effect. Danish scientist Svensmark has proposed that changes in cosmic rays linked to variations in sunspots affect cloud cover by a cloud seeding mechanism, but CO2 scientists discount that, so nothing is in the computer models. All of the climate change in the past century could be accounted for by less than a 3% change in cloud cover, but even with satellites cloud cover measurement is difficult. The cloud height is important as well as the density.We don't know future CO2 levels Everyone, crisis advocates and skeptics alike, agrees that whatever the CO2 sensitivity it is logarithmic. So if doubling CO2 produces a one degree rise, which is about the theoretical rise if there is nothing in the climate that magnifies the effect, then doubling it again would produce another degree of warming. An exponential rise in CO2 produces a linear rise in temperature. If we had a perfect model of CO2 effects on climate, we would still need to know how much CO2 is left to be produced and at what rate. Everyone agrees oil and coal are running out, but no one is sure how fast. But as supplies get scarce, prices rise and alternatives become economically viable. A technological breakthrough like a cheap, efficient battery would drop carbon consumption dramatically. It's another major unknown.A clarification of the resolution was agreed to in the debate comments so Pro must show that CO2 dominates climate in the past and future century. Pro has not made a convincing case that CO2 accounts for past climate change, nor that either computer models or carbon consumption assumptions are reliable enough to predict the future. He has the burden of proof.</t>

    <t>Since 2000, CO2 has risen by 54% with no increase in global temperatures. Why? Pro cannot provide a good answer to that question, and neither can the IPCC. The theory that CO2 dominates climate is therefore wrong. It may be that CO2 is contributing to warming at some level, but that a greater cooling factor is swamping the CO2 effect. If that's the case, there is no basis for supposing that CO2 will dominate climate in the future, because whatever cooling dominated the past 17 years may be the same or greater in the future. The IPCC cannot explain why a 54% increase in CO2 produced no increase in temperature. As described in [8], Von Storch systematically ran all the IPCC computer models of the climate, and found that the actual temperatures for the last 17 years fell outside the model predictions. That's after the models had been tweaked using knowledge of the lack of global warming. The models still could not describe the past, so clearly they cannot be counted on to predict the future. Pro only offers at base the fallacious logic that correlation means causation. But when CO2 increases by 54% in the past 17 years, and there is no increase in global temperature, then even the correlation claim fails.  Solar activity correlates well with global temperature for the past 17 years, for the entire 20the century and for as long as records of sunspot activity have been kept, which is back through the Middle Ages. Solar activity is discounted by CO2 theorists on the grounds that the measured irradiance of the sun, i.e.. the heat output, has not changed enough in recent decades to account for the temperature changes. However, solar activity produces changes in cosmic ray levels, and there is a theory that cosmic rays have an effect that changes cloud cover. The solar cosmic ray theory is also one of correlation, and cannot be considered causation until the mechanism is proved. However, unlike CO2 theory, the correlation actually holds over long and short periods. There is a close correlation of solar sunspot activity and global temperature for the past century. The past 17 years has been at the leveling off and start of a downward trend in sunspots after a period of increase during the 1980s and 1990s. Historical reconstruction shows CO2 does not dominate climate I pointed to reconstructions of climate for the distant past and the for the past 2000 years to show that climate has varied more than in recent years, and without any apparent relation to atmospheric CO2 levels. Pro argues that past climate doesn't count because we are only discussing the past century and the next century. Past climate counts because the laws of physics do not change at all over time. Consequently, if factors other than CO2 have always dominated climate, then it's unreasonable to suppose that a new CO2-only physics began recently. Pro's principle argument is that correlation proves causation. If there was no such correlation in the past, that is not sustained. Since the chance correlation only applies for a short time, it's important to Pro's case that we not look at the hundreds, thousands, and millions of years when there was no such correlation.Here are the two climate reconstructions referenced in the previous round:The climate of the past 2000 years shows there is nothing special about the past century. Climate has always been changing by about as much as in the past century, and often more.  Global warming hockey stick discredited The global warming hockey stick was presented in the 2000 IPCC report. It purported to show that the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age were local to Europe and that climate had not changed substantially in the past 1000 years, until the warming from 1983-1997. The statistical error used in the calculation yielding the hockey stick was discovered by McKitrick. [12. 'The Mann et al Northern Hemisphere 'Hockey Stick': A Tale of Due Diligence.' published in 'Shattered Consensus' edited by Patrick Michaels]. A good summary by a scientist who believes in human-caused global warming is from the MIT magazine Technology Review. The Wikipedia article, heavily biased towards CO2 theory claims that the hockey stick has since been proved because a recent analysis shows that recent temperatures were higher than the Medieval Warm Period. However, the accompanying graph shows that the MWP and the Little Ice Age existed as worldwide climate change, which is what the hockey stick was mainly supposed to disprove. The most recent reconstruction [3] clearly disproves the hockey stick. CO2 follows temperature increase That CO2 lags temperature in past climate is well known, but I apologize for giving the wrong link in the previous round. A journal article published in 2012 gives the result: “Our analyses of ice cores from the ice sheet in Antarctica shows that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere follows the rise in Antarctic temperatures very closely and is staggered by a few hundred years at most,” - Sune Olander Rasmussen [15. Watt provides graphs and links the Rasmussen paper. Another set of graphs showing the lag is given at. Total sea ice is at a highPro argued that shrinking Arctic ice proved that CO2 causes global warming. I pointed out that Antarctic ice is expanding, contradicting CO2 theory, and in keeping with the historically observed Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Pro responded that the ice doesn't melt until above the freezing point. Sure, but how was melting Arctic ice supposed to prove CO2 theory? The Antarctic ice has rapidly expanded since 2010, when Al Gore predicted it would be all gone by 2013. What this proves is that CO2 is not dominating climate. The natural PDO, not in the CO2 climate models is dominating the ice levels. The PDO seems to be linked to the second of three overlapping solar cycles, but the causation is unproved. Future CO2 levels are unknown I noted that even if CO2 dominates climate, there is no confident prediction of future CO2 levels. Nearly everyone agrees that the world is running out of fossil fuels, so there is an aggressive search for alternatives. A technological breakthrough, or a simple substantial rise in the price of oil could substantially lower the rate of CO2 increase. Pro did not respond.</t>
<h>    But when CO2 increases by 54% in the past 17 years, and there is no increase in global temperature, then even the correlation claim fails.</h>

    <t>My opponent claims that the 'climate competitors' of CO2 account for an unknown portion of temperature anomaly. We actually have a comprehensive understanding of both chemical and physical factors of climate change. He is correct that if we compared a chart of barbecue emissions with a chart of atmospheric heating, it would be absurd to assume barbecuing causes global warming.However, if we measured the effects of shortwave radiation, longwave radiation, the manner in which each passes through clouds, the effects of vegetation, the net greenhouse effects of the oceans, and emissions of non-barbecuing greenhouse gases, we would be in a much better position to say whether barbecue emissions cause global warming. [5] Con correctly argues that the barbecue theory would be defeated by showing that the volume of charcoal is insufficient. So back to the discussion, what's the volume of CO2 output? The United States alone has a crude oil energy output of 19,420,000,000,000,000 British Thermal Units [6]. Is this comparable to backyard barbecues?[5]The fifth report by the International Panel of Climate Change [7] claims that 'Human influence on the climate system is clear. This is evident from the increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, positive radiative forcing, observed warming, and understanding of the climate system.' It presents evidence that the CO2 output of fossil fuels and anthropogenic land usage together total are nearly three times higher than the CO2 output of rock weathering, volcanic activity, total respiration of life forms, forest fires and freshwater outgassing combined. [5]Con offers a reconstruction of the last 650,000,000 years, but this is a discussion about the years 1900 to 2200. Geological time is slow enough to be irrelevant in the 3-century blip we are discussing. In this context, hundreds of millions of years is simply beyond a defensible scale. CO2 levels are not higher than what they were 100,000,000 years ago before the existence of humans, but they are higher than they have been in 400,000 years. 'Current climate science has no explanation for the major climate variations of the past 2,000 years.' I have BOP for my claims about modern climate observations, but Con needs to provide a source for this claim.'That's why the discredited global warming hockey stick attempted to prove there were no past variations.' Source and specifics would be appreciated.Con claims that CO2 follows temperature rather than causing temperature, claiming the graphs are in a link. I would appreciate if Con could import these graphs into DBO and reference them as individual images, as I am unable to find an image that matches this description in the link provided.The Nature article quoted by Con demonstrates that solar insulation changed the Earth's climate more in 2,000 years than the human race has in 250 years. It does not suggest that the factors it discusses could compete with the human race during industrial and post-industrial ages. Again, this is a discussion about a 300 year timespan.[5]'Historically, Arctic ice melts when Antarctic ice increases in a cycle of 40 to 60 years called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO).' The Pacific Decadal Oscillation has no relation to the absorption of energy by the oceans from the years 1970 to 2010, which have shown a strong increase in net energy both in the liquid oceans and in the polar ice caps.“The Antarctic surge is so big that overall, although Arctic ice has decreased, the frozen area around both poles is one million square kilometres more than the long-term average.” Both Arctic and Antarctic temperatures are supposed to be far below freezing, and neither will commence a serious level of shrinking until they reach the melting temperature of water. As the top of the ice caps melt, the water runs down and is cooled by the ice below, slightly reducing or maintaining the total mass of the ice while possibly increasing the total area. However, it also increases the average temperatures of the Antarctic and Arctic.</t>

    <t>I thank my opposition for accepting this debate.This discussion is about Climate Change Anomalies from the years 1900 to 2200 (see comments section), and whether they are anthropogenic. Anomalies are deviations from 'schedule' weather cycles, and can include both hot and cold extremes, making 'global warming' only half of this discussion.So, right off the bat, temperature anomalies began rising just after the year 1900 [1].Y = temperature anomaly, range = 1.25C. As shown in the following chart [2], this corresponds closely with a recent rise in CO2 emissions. This chart shows that CO2 levels have always travelled in cycles, but broke their most recent scheduled downward cycle to reach their highest level in over 400,000 years. In a sense, one might say nature did half the work on CO2 and the human race took it from there.Y = CO1, range = 220 ppm, min = 180, max = 400. Correllation is obviously not causation, but the mechanics that link CO2 to temperature have been well documented.Atmospheric Greenhouse Effects: A Review [3]CO2 does not deflect visible light, which is what originally makes it to the earth's surface. Upon reaching the earth's surface, visible light is partially absorbed by the earth or water, and partially reflected. The reflection process lowers its energy level, turning it into infrared light. CO2 deflects infrared light. So CO2's reflective properties for the earth are one-directional. Visible light pass downward unperturbed, but upward infrared is deflected downwards / sideways. This effectually increases the amount of light striking the surface of the planet, which at current greenhouse levels protects life from the freezing cold of space, and at future levels threatens to roast life - not to death, but to ecological disequilibrium.  Oceanic Greenhouse Effects: A ReviewThe oceans currently absorb atmospheric CO2 and are undergoing a resulting drop in pH. They are also currently absorbing most of the extra heat from the sun, and therefore are experiencing a rise in temperature. Once they heat to a certain point, the oceans are expected to start releasing CO2 back into the atmosphere, which may include massive reserves that have been down there for millions of years. However, before the oceans can truly begin warming, the ice caps have to melt. And as we can see here [4], though the ice caps have shown about a half-century lag behind the thinner, more responsive atmosphere, they are roughly 1 million square kilometers smaller than they ought to be, as of 2014.It appears that climate anomalies are closely associated with CO2 levels, that CO2 levels are primarily anthropogenic and will continue to be so until the next 'natural' CO2 spike roughly one hundred thousand years from now (chart 1), and that the greenhouse mechanisms behind all this are straightforward and established.</t>

    <t>There has been no global warming for 17 years, despite a 54% increase in CO2 Pro now argues there is something wrong with NASA's Remote Sensing Satellite (RSS) data [6] because it does not measure temperature with a thermometer. No scientist, to my knowledge, has ever questioned the ability of RSS to measure temperature. Satellite measurements are far superior to the spotty coverage of weather stations subject to urban heat island effects. Satellites provide global coverage at much higher densities than attainable with in situ observations. In situ observations also suffer from non-uniform temporal coverage and undocumented changes in the instrumentation used that can lead to local biases and increased uncertainty. … Satellites can measure the temperature of the atmosphere by evaluating thermal emission from gases in the atmosphere. ... By choosing the different measurement frequencies, and thus different values of absorptivity, the emission from different layers of the atmosphere can be measured. RSS studies the measurements made by 3 series of satellite-borne microwave sounders in order to construct long-term, climate-quality atmospheric temperature datasets for use by the scientific community. If temperature continued to climb in the past 17 years, we would expect advocates of the theory of CO2 dominated climate to trumpet the success of climate models. But those advocates recognize the fact that the models have failed, the Voosen article I cited makes it clear that CO2 advocates are struggling for an explanation of why the models have failed. I explained in detail why there is no inconsistency with having no temperature increase in 17 years and having the 2001-2010 decade averaging warmer than the 90s. Pro ignored my explanation and claimed that there is a conflict. Pro said I claimed that the temperature anomaly was reset for each decade. That's nonsense, I made no such claim, and if it were reset every decade then the temperature anomalies would be a string of zeros. The anomaly is an arbitrary offset to prevent graphs from having to be scaled with the average global temperature of around 59 degrees F or 287 degrees Kelvin. Pro's graph shows global warming to have stopped since 2000. In additional to providing the actual data and the opinions of scientists who advocate CO2-dominated climate, I provided the work of Von Storch and separately of Mauritsen who showed that CO2 models could not explain the pause. [7] Pro claims I misrepresented Von Storch because in 2006 Von Storch said he believed CO2 dominates climate, but in 2012 Von Storch admitted the CO2 models failed. I quoted Von Storch as saying “we find that the continued stagnation in global warming, from 1998 to 2012, is inconsistent with model predictions, even at the 2% confidence level.” [17] That's not a misrepresentation. Scientists become convinced by unrelenting contrary data. The same is true of other CO2 advocates, quoted by Voosen [20], who finally have given up trying to defend the models. I cited Tinsdale's book [7] for it's extensive comparisons showing the CO2 models fail. Pro argues that I needed to have shown and argued every piece of evidence in the book. No, all I needed to do was to make a claim and cite the evidence. To refute Tinsdale, Pro might have cited some contrary compendium showing all the models were on target, but there is no such evidence to be cited. Some of the CO2 advocates claim the lack of global warming is due to something other than cosmic ray clouds seeding. Hansen supposes it might be reflective soot from coal burning in China. For the present debate, it suffices to say that CO2 is not dominating climate, and so until the science is resolved future predictions cannot be made reliability under the assumption that CO2 dominates. Cosmic ray effects, or something else associated with sunspots, are clearly the most likely factor because the sunspot trend since the early 1800s has been generally in favor of warming, but sunspots activity also tracks the Medieval Warm Period, the Little Ice Age, the global warming pause from the 40s through the 70s, the 70s sharp cooling, and the current 17 year lack of global warming. All this was shown clearly in the data presented in the debate.Current models do not include all the natural forcings  Pro's graphs of temperature with and without CO2 are purely math model predictions. He says that they include sunspot and ocean oscillation effects, but they unquestionably do not. That's apparent because the real temperatures post 2000 did not rise as the graphs show, and also because the projections go out into the future. Voosen [20] specifically referenced these elements missing from the models. The “natural forcings” in the model projections are defective because they do not include the cosmic ray and magnetic effects of sunspots, rather only the inconsequential changes in irradiance. Pro began by arguing that that we should not look at temperatures before 1900, because that's when anthropogenic global warming began. However, the physics of climate do not change, and temperature reconstructions on scales of millions of years, hundreds of thousands of years, and the past 2000 years show that CO2 has never dominated climate, no matter what the source of CO2. CO2 levels have been many times current levels. In the past, CO2 increase was a product of warming, not a cause. CO2 may increase warming slightly, but it's never prevented natural forcings from driving temperatures down. To show that CO2 now dominates climate, advocates must show that no other natural factors are significant, but current lack of warming shows that the models are dead wrong. In this round Pro introduced the argument that CO2-induced warming began in the 1800s. But then what caused the preceding Medieval Warm Period and Little Age? It's far more likely that whatever caused those major climate changes ended, producing the subsequent warming. Those major climate events were tightly correlated with sunspot activity. To argue it was CO2, a switch must have been flipped around 1825 causing sunspots to no longer have an effect and CO2 to start dominating. Polar sea ice has increased to a current high, contrary to CO2 theoryPro began by claiming that the decrease in Arctic Ice proved that CO2 causes global warming. That claim evaporated in the light of evidence that Arctic ice has been disappearing and reappearing for centuries with the cycle of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which is not in the CO2 climate models. Also, CO2 warming does not explain why Antarctic ice has increased so much so that total ice has had a net increase. Pro shifted to arguing that total accumulated ice on earth has been decreasing since the end of the Little Age, but that is better explained by sunspot activity than CO2. No one claims the Little Age was due to a sudden CO2 shortage.Future CO2 levels are unpredictable. Pro offered only unsupported assertions to counter cited expert opinion that we are rapidly running out of fossil fuels, and technology will provide substitutes. The sun, not CO2, dominates climate  We are seeing the real world destroy the theory of CO2 dominating climate. The CO2 math models cannot be tuned to explain how a 54% increase in CO2 has failed to produce and increase in global temperatures. For a while, the notion was that the failure was some transient glitch that would quickly disappear. After 17 years, it's clear that there is a fundamental lack of understanding reflected in climate models. CO2 theorists have been fervent in clinging to their theory, but they are nonetheless still scientists and ultimately obliged to yield their theory to the contrary data. I'm sure that science will ultimately succeed in getting climate models that match reality, and that the models will include some effect of CO2. But it should not be a surprise that the sun dominates climate, even though we are still figuring out exactly how.</t>

    <t>'NASA data, which I cited in [6], shows there has been no global warming for 17 years.'So how do we have two competing sources for what should be the same information?PRO [5] - IPCCCON [6] - NASA?If we look closely, CON's [6] doesn't actually reference NASA, it references wattsupwiththat.com. The wattsupwiththat article uses RSS data, not NASA data. RSS, or Remote Sensing Systems, does not measure temperatures using a thermometer, it takes readings of microwaves, as explained on its homepage. The data demonstrates that microwaves are not 'net heating' the earth, but CON and the wattsupwiththat article argue that the earth itself is not being warmed. When measured by thermometers throughout the globe, IPCC and NASA sources have shown that the earth clearly is being warmed.CON's [6] is a particularly ironic source in the context of this debate, during which CON has advocated sunspots as an alternative temperature explanation to CO2.CON argues that 'decadal average' means that the meaning of 'anomaly' is reset every decade. The IPCC actually addressed this concern by setting every decadal average relative to the same constant (in this case, 'Anomalies are relative to the mean of 1961−1990.'[7]). 'My primary reference for the claim that that IPCC models cannot explain the 17 year lack of global warming is Tinsdale's book “Climate Models Fail” [7].' - CONThe existence of a book title is not an argued debate point. If CON has read Tisdale's book, he should be able to explain and present what he learned in this debate. Otherwise, I should be having this debate with Bob Tisdale.'Tinsdale provides a book length comparison of IPCC model results showing that what actually happened in climate was outside of the error band of model predictions.' - CONWhich model predictions do CON and Tisdale speak of? Because when the IPCC compared model predictions to observations, the temperature observations were outside the 'natural forcings' band of model predictions, and well withing the 'natural and anthropogenic forcings' band of model predictions. This was part of what I presented in round 4. 'Tinsdale also referenced the Mauritsen paper, which I linked in [7]' - CONCON [7] references Tinsdale, not Mauritsen.'Temperature was supposed to rise sharply after 2000, as the figure shows, but it did not. Models proved wrong cannot be relied upon for future predictions.'Perhaps CON missed this: the blue shading is the natural, absence-of-man prediction; the pink shading is the natural + anthropogenic predictions; and the black line is the reading taken by the thermometers. The black line is consistent with the blue shading for the antarctic region, seems indecisive for the Southern Ocean, and correllates with the pink shading for the Arctic, North America, Europe, Asia, the North Pacific, the North Atlantic, Africa, the South Pacific, South America, the South Atlantic, the Indian Ocean, Australia, and Antarctica. 'Pro's initial contention was that vanishing Arctic sea ice proves that CO2 dominates climate.' - CONPRO's initial contention was actually that temperature anomalies correspond to a rise in CO2 as predicted by the greenhouse effect, and demonstrated by sea ice temperature, sea ice mass, climate temperature, ocean temperature, and ocean PH.'Correlation does not prove causation.' - CONPRO 20th century physics consisted of bombarding particles into each other and measuring the deviation of their paths. This was well-tested far beyond being a correlation argument, to the point that physicists predict photonic behavior with laser precision (literally). It is by this mechanism that greenhouse theory exists. It's not a correlation argument, it mathematically calculates that visible photons have no trouble passing through the earth's atmosphere to warm the surface, but upon bouncing back upwards and losing energy (increasing wavelength), are prone to be deflected back at the earth by greenhouse gases. This re-warms the earth. 'Global warming is global, so it cannot be that Arctic ice measures warming but Antarctic ice does not.' - CONThey both measure warming, but remember - it's global, so we cannot use Antarctic ice to ignore temperature observations from the Arctic, North America, Europe, Asia, the North Pacific, the North Atlantic, Africa, the South Pacific, South America, the South Atlantic, the Indian Ocean, Australia, and - yes - even the temperature readings of the Antarctic (as I pointed out in round 3, ice and temperature cannot have a linear relationship except at temperatures near freezing point - this is why 'absorption of energy' is more relevant than short term temperature).'In the last round, Pro changed his position and argued that total ice is important and not sea ice' - CONI argued that deuterium levels from the last ten thousand years were less relevant than energy readings from the last century. CON's narrative of my position is unrecognizable to me, so my most objective route at this point is to request of voters that they actually find the 'PRO' arguments that correlate with the 'CON' narrative before either agreeing or disagreeing with it - and vice versa.'total ice has been decreasing since the early 1800s, well before any claim of anthropogenic warming.' - CONDeforestation has actually increased net CO2 emissions since before 1750 but in negotiating this debate, CON chose 'temperature anomalies from 1900 to 2200 are / will be predominantly anthropogenic' from a number of other possible Anthropogenic Climate Change Exists subtopics, so we'll have to save that discussion for another day. As I have explained at least three times in this debate, ice represents two out of seven continents to measure, and as CON has explained, this is a discussion about global temperature.'Pro claimed that melting land ice in Antarctica caused the increase in sea ice.' - CONI discussed three measurements - temperature, volume, and area. These were ALL in regards to land ice in Antarctica. PRO Round 3:Both Arctic and Antarctic temperatures are supposed to be far below freezing, and neither will commence a serious level of shrinking until they reach the melting temperature of water. As the top of the ice caps melt, the water runs down and is cooled by the ice below, slightly reducing or maintaining the total mass of the ice while possibly increasing the total area. However, it also increases the average temperatures of the Antarctic and Arctic. 'Future CO2 levels are unknown' - CONSolar, volcanic, botanic, and other alleged hidden variables in century-measured climate change would have to accelerate hundreds of times over in the next two centuries if anthropogenic CO2 is to become a 'secondary' driver of climate anomalies. This can even be deduced from CON's use of geological data, which covers up to 600 million years at a time.Current physical predictions indicate that anthropogenic global warming will be steady and lingering for several centuries, and statistically comprehensive climate data corresponds to this theory.9.</t>

    <t>The instigator has set the rules of the debate. I thank him for that. Please allow me to recapitulate.  'Pro may use their first round, but not round 5. Pro has BoP. Pro has to prove the topic right. I will argue (as con) that global warming does not exist.'  The topic is 'Global Warming Exists.'  Since this, so formulated, is totally open-ended I will state some definitions. It is open-ended because 'Global warming' is left undefined. Left the way it is, I only need show that the Earth has had a hotter year than a previous year to show that 'global warming exists.' Thus the debate would end here. I do not believe that was the intention of the instigator even if he framed the debate this way. However, since the term 'Anthropogenic' is not included, I will not include it here. I only need show that 'Global Warming' (see below) exists now, and NOT that is a consequence of making's action under the rules of this debate.  I would like to address one issue up front, this is the issue of intellectual authority.  Authority au'thor'i'ty [uh-thawr-i-tee, uh-thor-] noun, plural au'thor'i'ties. [1-4] redacted 5.an accepted source of information, advice, etc.  We will reference the definition (5) here. 'An accepted source of information' In the 21st Century, it is recognized that science and technology have reached a stage where educational specialization is necessary for technical disciplines. No longer can just anyone hang up a shingle and practice medicine. Now, a degree from an accredited university is necessary. In addition, we recognize that people with medical degrees, have an intellectual authority in the field of medicine. This means specifically, their opinion in the matters of medicine carry more weight than the opinions of those who have not obtained the same degree. Climate Science is also such field. The conclusion here is that people with advanced degrees in Climate Sciences have more authority in when discussing 'Global Warming' than does the non-climate scientist.  'Climate change skeptics regularly denounce me as a disgrace to journalism for declining to accept their dogma, which is mostly received wisdom from sources that I'd trust to evaluate the published science about as much as I'd trust a plumber to perform open heart surgery. Nothing against plumbers, mind you. They're just not heart surgeons. And the economists, statisticians and agenda-driven politicians routinely cited by the skeptics aren't glaciologists, botanists, biologists, oceanographers, atmospheric physicists or computer modelling specialists.' -James Hoggan  For a working definition of 'Global Warming,' I suggest we use 'Global warming is the unequivocal and continuing rise in the average temperature of Earth's climate system.'  Climate VS Weather The discussion here is about climate vs weather. I have included a video to show the difference. Since It is hard to add to the arguments in this video, I'll allow it to stand on its own. This debate is about CLIMATE not Weather.  Global Warming Introduction  We are in the midst of a warning trend. Various fluctuations happen, in climate, over time, However, the current warming trend is of particular significance because most of it is very likely human-induced and proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented in the past 1,300 years (see) IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, Summary for Policymakers, p. 5 ' B.D.

Subjective Realities - English speaking Nations James Powell searched the Web of Science for peer-reviewed scientific articles published between 1 January 1991 and 12 November 2012 that had the keyword phrases 'global warming' or 'global climate change.' The search produced 13,950 articles.By Mr. Powell's definition 24 of the 13,950 articles, 0.17% or 1 in 581, clearly reject human-caused global warming or endorse a cause other than CO2 emissions for observed warming. The articles have a total of 33,690 individual authors (rounded to 33,700 in the figure). The 24 rejecting papers have a total of 34 authors, about 1 in 1,000.  What we MINIMALLY see here is there were 13,950 and 580 out of every 581 peer-reviewed scientific articles were about AGW or AGW effects, mitigation, adaptation, methods of detecting, climate modeling, and paleoclimatology. Since AGW is dependent of 'Global Warming' a priori, we deduce those papers endorse the idea of global warming.  Here is Mr. Powell's interpretation of his study: 'When a new scientific theory is first proposed, scientists often go out of their way to state explicitly that they reject it, or that they accept it. This was the case with continental drift in the 1920s, with plate tectonics in the 1960s, and with the Alvarez theory of dinosaur extinction in the 1980s. One reading the literature in these fields can usually tell from the title of an article alone whether an author rejects the new theory. But after a theory achieves maturity and becomes the ruling paradigm, scientists no longer see any point in stating explicitly that they accept the now-no-longer-new theory. They take it as a given, often as an observational fact'like the measured movement of tectonic plates and the measured global temperature rise. To explicitly endorse the ruling theory would have the counter-effect of suggesting that the theory is in doubt. It is obvious that global warming has achieved the status of the ruling paradigm of climate science. Thus it is reasonable to assume that publishing scientists who today reject human-caused global warming would make it clear that they do so, while publishing scientists who accept the theory would not feel the need to say so explicitly. As a practical matter, virtually all of the global warming papers that Oreskes and I separately reviewed can be classified as about effects, mitigation, adaptation, methods of detecting, climate modeling, and paleoclimatology. Authors of these papers would hardly be likely to deny the existence of the very thing they are writing about. It is theoretically possible that a paper on paleoclimatology could be the exception, dealing with the lack of evidence for CO2-driven global warming in the geologic past, say, leading the author to question the seriousness of modern, human-caused global warming. I did not find such papers. What we know for a fact is that among the authors of peer-reviewed articles, only a tiny fraction, which I estimate as about 1 author in 1,000, rejects human-caused global warming. In my opinion, based on my understanding of the history of science, it is reasonable to conclude that nearly all publishing climate scientists accept that human activities are causing the Earth to warm. Polls of scientists reinforce this conclusion, but polls are no substitute for the primary, peer-reviewed literature, the ground truth of science. 'The International Community (All of the world is NOT the United States) Science and global warming affects all of us. Global Warming is not a US ONLY issue, yet climate change denial, to a very large extent is. It is at least almost limited to the English speaking world with over 80% of it being in the US. The issue of 'global warming' is not a political controversy in most countries. How is that possible is Global Warming is not really happening?</t>

    <t>I will start by thanking the CON side for their response.  One does not 'declare' facts. CON's arguments are false memes without substance.  1. No Global Warming CON: 'There hasn't been any global warming since 1997.' (DECLARATION) There is no substantiation for this claim. it is patently false. It also shows the CON side either did not look at the video or did not understand it.  CON: 'It also begs an obvious question: How can we be experiencing global warming if there's no actual 'global warming?' The CON side 'declared' a meme, 'there is no global warming' and asks a rhetorical question based on the false meme.  2. No Scientific Consensus CON:'There is no scientific consensus that global warming is occurring and caused by man' (DECLARATION) Again a declared meme, and false. I have shown that of all peer reviewed articles written the last thirty years over 99.7% of them concurred that global warming is happening. Simply stating there is no consensus means nothing.  The only argument presented against consensus is a propaganda document called 'The OISM Petition.' Almost everything about this supposed propaganda document is suspect. CON references this here:  CON: ' Over 31,000 scientists have signed on to a petition saying humans aren't causing global warming.'  Now to sign on to this document one has to state one was a 'scientist.' That includes Medical Doctors, Materials Engineers, etc. While these are certainly complex fields, being a Medical Doctor does not give one special insights into Climate Science. On top of this, the number of scientists are inflated for propaganda effect.  This document is very much like '100 authors against Einstein,' a document, signed by two real 'scientists' and a number of others. Einstein's response was telling, 'if Relativity was False, 1 author would be quite enough.' 'At this point it's literally impossible to know because the names and degrees on the (above) list cannot be verified by anyone outside the OISM. We can only take the OISM's word that they're all real names, that all the degrees are correct, and so on. This does not stand up to the most basic tests of scientific credibility.' ...  'Ultimately, The OISM petition will continue to rear it's ugly head until its fabricated credibility has been thoroughly demolished. Social conservatives and libertarians, each of which has their own ideological reasons to push the OISM petition, have been effective at keeping the '30,000 scientists reject warming chicken-littleism of IPCC' meme circulating throughout conservative media outlets, even as climate disruption-focused media have worked at limiting the damage from the OISM petition. But given the fact that the science supporting a dominantly anthropogenic cause for climate disruption is overwhelming, it's only a matter of time before the OISM petition wilts in the heat.'  There is a worse part here. This is a propaganda document propagated by propaganda sites on the Internet.  More than this, the CON misses that even this validates the PRO side.  CON writes: ' Over 31,000 [unverified] scientists have signed on to a petition saying humans aren't causing global warming.'  But these same people make no claim that Global Warming is NOT happening. They say humans aren't causing GW. Now the fact that they address that humans are not CAUSE of the problem implies that they recognize that the problem exists.  'Scientific consensus is the collective judgment, position, and opinion of the community of scientists in a particular field of study. Consensus implies general agreement, though not necessarily unanimity.  Consensus is normally achieved through communication at conferences, the publication process, replication and peer review.' 3. Arctic Ice misconception Again, a short term trend presented as Climate science. This example almost invalidates CONs entire argument as it shows two extreme problems with CON's reasoning. The first is that he only addresses arctic ice 'EXTENT' not its MASS which is a much more significant measurement. 'Just to clarify, not only is the Arctic sea ice extent decreasing, but just as critical, the mean thickness of the Arctic sea ice pack also has precipitously decreased. In fact, although not quite an ice extent minimum record year, by February, this year was already a minimum record year for the amount of thick multiyear ice present in the pack. '  Secondly he falls into the trap which was displayed in the Degrasse video above. Citing a statistic over six months shows a marked lack of understanding of the basic science involved.  3. James Hansen's 'Prediction' 'James Hansen made his statement in response to a question by Bob Reiss, a journalist and author, in 1988. He did not predict that the West Side Highway would be underwater in 20 years.  Bob Reiss reports the conversation as:  'When I interviewed James Hansen I asked him to speculate on what the view outside his office window could look like in 40 years with doubled CO2. I'd been trying to think of a way to discuss the greenhouse effect in a way that would make sense to average readers. I wasn't asking for hard scientific studies. It wasn't an academic interview. It was a discussion with a kind and thoughtful man who answered the question. You can find the descriptio''n in two of my books, most recently The Coming Storm.'  James Hansen reports the conversation as follows: 'Reiss asked me to speculate on changes that might happen in New York City in 40 years assuming CO2 doubled in amount.'  SO the quote used is out of context and DOES NOT says what CON purports it to say. Again, this calls serious question into CON's selection of data sources and ability to validate data.  USE OF SUSPECT DATA SOURCES. One of the most disturbing parts of CON's arguments is his reliance on Propaganda sites for information. Data on the internet is highly suspect and requires a measure of data validation. It is easy to find 'evidence' for almost anything on the Internet. It is not easy to find AUTHORITATIVE information on the Internet. To give an Hypothetical example, it is as if we had been debating the Israeli-Palestians conflict and CON only referenced HAMAS websites. 'Spencer is a signatory to An Evangelical Declaration on Global Warming, which states that 'Earth and its ecosystems ' created by GOD'S INTELLIGENT DESIGN AND INFINITE POWER AND SUSTAINED BY HIS FAITHFUL PROVIDENCE ' are robust, resilient, self-regulating, and self-correcting''  This is HARDLY a SCIENTIFIC authority. Invoking 'intelligent Design' (Myth) is mixing Religion with 'science' and hardly lends credibility to the Dr. Spencer's authority. I suspect, as do most others, that Dr. Spencer's reliance on ancient superstitions has more to do with his work than does the science.  'In 2011, Spencer and Braswell published a paper in Remote Sensing concluding that more energy is radiated back to space and released earlier than previously thought. Spencer stated, 'The satellite observations suggest there is much more energy lost to space during and after warming than the climate models show. There is a huge discrepancy between the data and the forecasts that is especially big over the oceans.'  The paper was criticized by mainstream climate scientists.Kerry Emanuel of MIT, said this work was cautious and limited mostly to pointing out problems with forecasting heat feedback.  The editor-in-chief of Remote Sensing, Wolfgang Wagner, later resigned over publication of Spencer and Braswell (2011),stating, 'From a purely formal point of view, there were no errors with the review process. [...] the problem I see with the paper by Spencer and Braswell is not that it declared a minority view ...but that IT ESSENTIALLY IGNORED THE SCIENTIFIC ARGUMENTS OF ITS OPPONENTS. This latter point was missed in the review process, explaining why I perceive this paper to be fundamentally flawed and therefore wrongly accepted by the journal.' Wagner added he, 'would also like to PERSONALLY PROTEST AGAINST HOW THE AUTHORS AND LIKE-MINDED CLIMATE SCEPTICS HAVE MUCH EXAGGERATED THE PAPER'S CONCLUSIONS IN PUBLIC STATEMENTS'  Continuing to the GlobalResearch Link, this is NOT a reputable organization.  This site is set up and run by Michel Chossudovsky, The Western Standard included Chossudovsky on the list of 'Canada's nuttiest professors, those whose absurdity stands head and shoulders above their colleagues'; criticizing Chussodovsky's thesis and views ' that the U.S. had knowledge of the September 11 attacks before they happened; that Washington had weapons that could influence climate change; and lastly, that the large banking institutions are the cause of the collapse of smaller economies ' as 'wild-eyed conspiracy theories'. Such as Washington's New World Order Weapons Can Trigger Climate Change' - Michel Chossudovsky  Here is a GlobalResearch Link about the 9/11 conspiracy. As I look over CON's arguments, there is no attempt, at all, to validate the authority of the statements presented. Global warming has been shown and there has yet to have been a single verifiable argument lodged against it here.</t>

Pro still does not fulfill BoP, even if my arguments are declared false or broken apart, this does not immediately make them fulfill BoP, which they still have yet to do.  2. I have more scientific evidence that my opponent did not address.  3. A group of 15 scientists and meteorologists have put forward a scathing rebuttal to the Obama administration's recent climate report which said the U.S. is already being harmed by global warming. Scientists skeptical that mankind is causing the Earth's climate to change say that such claims are based on false theories and flawed models. The White House report is a 'masterpiece of marketing' that is trying to scare people into action, scientists said. 'As independent scientists, we know that apparent evidence of 'Climate Change,' however scary, is not proof of anything,' wrote the 15 scientists and meteorologists,including Dr. Don Easterbrook of Western Washington University and Dr. George Wolff, who formerly chaired the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee. 'Science derives its objectivity from robust logic and honest evidence repeatedly tested by all knowledgeable scientists, not just those paid to support the administration's version of 'Global Warming,' 'Climate Change,' 'Climate Disruption,' or whatever their marketing specialists call it today,' they continued. The White House's 'National Climate Assessment' (NCA), released last week, claimed that the U.S. was already being affected by global warming though warmer temperatures and increasing extreme weather events. But the 15 skeptical scientists said the White House is trying to lay the blame for global warming at the feet of the fossil fuels industry when there is little evidence to back up that claim. The Earth's climate is very cyclical and has gone through many changes in the past, the scientists said, without humans emitting carbon dioxide. 'This NCA is so grossly flawed it should play no role in U.S. Energy Policy Analyses and CO2 regulatory processes,' the skeptics wrote. 'As this rebuttal makes clear, the NCA provides no scientific basis whatsoever for regulating CO2 emissions.' 'We are asked to believe that humans are drastically changing the earth's climate by burning fossil fuels,' they added. 'The problem with their theory is very simple: It is NOT true.' The NCA says the U.S. average temperature has risen between 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit to 1.9 degrees Fahrenheit since 1895, which is causing more extreme weather, like hurricanes and droughts, and harming fragile ecosystems around the country. The NCA also warns that the U.S. average temperature could rise 4 degrees Fahrenheit in the coming decades if nothing is done to limit carbon dioxide emissions. The report suggests a slew of regulatory solutions from cap-and-trade to green energy subsidies to mitigate global warming. ''Global Warming' has not been global and has not set regional records where warming has occurred,' the skeptical scientists rebutted. 'For example, over the last fifty years, while the Arctic has warmed, the tropical oceans had a flat trend and the Antarctic cooled slightly.'[1]  I had more info that pro did not address, that had many scientists behind them. 4. As the Obama administration and Senate Democrats feverishly stoke up hellfire and brimstone global warming alarm to promote a Climate Action Plan, leading voices in green choir robes have abandoned the climate crisis hymnal.  Dr. Patrick Moore, a co-founder of Greenpeace, quit the activist environmental organization in 1986 after it strayed away from objective science and took a sharp turn to the political left.  Testifying on Feb. 25 before the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee's Subcommittee on Oversight, he took issue with the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) claim that 'Since the mid-20th century it is 'extremely likely' that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming.'  Moore pointed out 'There is no scientific proof that human emissions of carbon dioxide are the dominant cause of the minor warming of the Earth's atmosphere over the past 100 years,' arguing that 'perhaps the simplest way to expose the fallacy of extreme certainty is to look at the historical record.'  He told the committee: 'When modern life evolved over 500 million years ago, CO2 was more than 10 times higher than today, yet life flourished at this time. Then an ice age occurred 450 million years ago when carbon dioxide was 10 times higher than today.'  Moore also noted that 'The increase in temperature between 1910 and 1940 was virtually identical to the increase between 1970 and 2000. Yet the IPCC does not attribute the increase from 1910'1942 human influence.' Why then, he asks, 'does the IPCC believe that a virtually identical increase in temperature after 1950 is caused mainly by human influence, when it has no explanation for nearly identical increase from 1910 to 1940?'  Moore emphasized that there is no reason to believe that a warmer climate would be anything but beneficial for humans and the majority of other species. On the other hand, there is ample reason to believe that a sharp cooling of the climate would bring disastrous results for human civilization.  Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt, a prominent Socialist and a father of Germany's environmental movement, has become another strong critic of the IPCC's alarmist global warming doctrine. His lack of trust began while serving as an expert reviewer for an IPCC renewable energy report as the renewable energy division head of Germany's second largest utility company.  Upon discovering and pointing out numerous factual inaccuracies to IPCC officials, they simply brushed them aside. Stunned by this, he began to wonder if IPCC reports on climate change were similarly sloppy. After digging into the IPCC's climate report he was horrified to find similar incompetency and misrepresentations, including climate models that were fudged to produce exaggerated temperature increases.  Dr. Vahrenholt concluded: 'The facts need to be discussed sensibly and scientifically, without first deciding on the results.' And although CO2 may have some warming influence, he believes that the sun plays a far greater role in the whole scheme of things.  James Lovelock, a highly respected scientist, predicted in 2006 that: 'Before this century is over billions of us will die and the few breeding pairs of people that survive will be in the Arctic where climate remains tolerable.'  More recently, however, he admitted to MSNBC: 'We don't know what the climate is doing. We thought we knew 20 years ago. That led to some alarmist books . . . mine included . . . because it looked clear cut . . . but it hasn't happened.'  The 92-year-old Lovelock went on to note, 'The climate is doing its usual tricks . . . there's nothing much happening yet even though we were supposed to be halfway toward a frying world now.' He added, 'Yet the temperature has stayed almost constant, whereas it should have been rising . . . carbon dioxide has been rising, no question about that.'  Moore, Vahrenholt, and Lovelock are but three within an expanding multitude of scientists who are cooling on climate alarm.  When previously asked on Fox Business News who is responsible for promoting unwarranted fear and what their motives are, Moore said: 'A powerful convergence of interests. Scientists seeking grant money, media seeking headlines, universities seeking huge grants from major institutions, foundations, environmental groups, politicians wanting to make it look like they are saving future generations. And all of these people have converged on this issue.'  Moore warns that, 'The alarmism is driving us through scare tactics to adopt energy policies that are going to create a huge amount of energy poverty among the poor people. It's not good for people and it's not good for the environment. In a warmer world we can produce more food.'  Nobel Laureate physicist Dr. Ivar Giaever has referred to global warming ideology as a 'pseudoscience' that begins with an emotionally-appealing hypothesis, and 'then only looks for items which appear to support it,' while ignoring ample contrary evidence.  Tragically, that pseudoscience does greatest injustice to those who can least afford it.[2]  Pseudoscience is not science, the climate change claim was started by liberals and democrats. It is also supported by those politicians. Let me remind you that NASA is government funded, therefor does what the government wants.</t>

    <t>c1. 1) There hasn't been any global warming since 1997: If nothing changes in the next year, we're going to have kids who graduate from high school who will have never seen any 'global warming' during their lifetimes. That's right; the temperature of the planet has essentially been flat for 17 years. This isn't a controversial assertion either. Even the former Director of the Climate Research Unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia, Phil Jones, admits that it's true. Since the planet was cooling from 1940-1975 and the upswing in temperature afterward only lasted 22 years, a 17 year pause is a big deal. It also begs an obvious question: How can we be experiencing global warming if there's no actual 'global warming?' 2) There is no scientific consensus that global warming is occurring and caused by man: Questions are not decided by 'consensus.' In fact, many scientific theories that were once widely believed to be true were made irrelevant by new evidence. Just to name one of many, many examples, in the early seventies, scientists believed global cooling was occurring. However, once the planet started to warm up, they changed their minds. Yet, the primary 'scientific' argument for global warming is that there is a 'scientific consensus' that it's occurring. Setting aside the fact that's not a scientific argument, even if that ever was true (and it really wasn't), it's certainly not true anymore. Over 31,000 scientists have signed on to a petition saying humans aren't causing global warming. More than 1000 scientists signed on to another report saying there is no global warming at all. There are tens of thousands of well-educated, mainstream scientists who do not agree that global warming is occurring at all and people who share their opinion are taking a position grounded in science. 3) Arctic ice is up 50% since 2012: The loss of Arctic ice has been a big talking point for people who believe global warming is occurring. Some people have even predicted that all of the Arctic ice would melt by now because of global warming. Yet, Arctic ice is up 50% since 2012. How much Arctic ice really matters is an open question since the very limited evidence we have suggests that a few decades ago, there was less ice than there is today, but the same people who thought the drop in ice was noteworthy should at least agree that the increase is important as well. 4) Climate models showing global warming have been wrong over and over: These future projections of what global warming will do to the planet have been based on climate models. Essentially, scientists make assumptions about how much of an impact different factors will have; they guess how much of a change there will be and then they project changes over time. Unfortunately, almost all of these models showing huge temperature gains have turned out to be wrong. Former NASA scientist Dr. Roy Spencer says that climate models used by government agencies to create policies 'have failed miserably.' Spencer analyzed 90 climate models against surface temperature and satellite temperature data, and found that more than 95 percent of the models 'have over-forecast the warming trend since 1979, whether we use their own surface temperature dataset (HadCRUT4), or our satellite dataset of lower tropospheric temperatures (UAH).' There's an old saying in programming that goes, 'Garbage in, garbage out.' In other words, if the assumptions and data you put into the models are faulty, then the results will be worthless. If the climate models that show a dire impact because of global warming aren't reliable -- and they're not -- then the long term projections they make are meaningless. 5) Predictions about the impact of global warming have already been proven wrong: The debate over global warming has been going on long enough that we've had time to see whether some of the predictions people made about it have panned out in the real world. For example, Al Gore predicted all the Arctic ice would be gone by 2013. In 2005, the Independent ran an article saying that the Artic had entered a death spiral. Scientists fear that the Arctic has now entered an irreversible phase of warming which will accelerate the loss of the polar sea ice that has helped to keep the climate stable for thousands of years....The greatest fear is that the Arctic has reached a 'tipping point' beyond which nothing can reverse the continual loss of sea ice and with it the massive land glaciers of Greenland, which will raise sea levels dramatically. Of course, the highway is still there. Meanwhile, Arctic ice is up 50% since 2012. James Hansen of NASA fame predicted that the West Side Highway in New York would be under water by now because of global warming. If the climate models and the predictions about global warming aren't even close to being correct, wouldn't it be more scientific to reject hasty action based on faulty data so that we can further study the issue and find out what's really going on?  Rebuttal to physical realities 1. Scientists have only been observing temperature objectively since the 1970's, which proves pro wrong on this point. 2. My opponent provides links to few of his claims, so they should be considered false. 4. The record is less than 30 years (there were fluctuations until 1980), so I doubt this is any proof. Scientists can tell you how long a star upwards of 50 light-years away will die with more accuracy than telling you next week's weather. (Earth has very unpredictable climate and weather due to large amounts of liquid water.) Short-term warming is not the Earth's climate changing. 6. There have been 27-year long heat/cold fluctuations since 1428. (link above) 7. Actually, the 1900's are even better proof of this. (link above) 8. Pro has not fulfilled BoP, so it is safe to say that pro cannot prove this topic.</t>

    <t>Rebuttal to sources:Going over the sources you cited:The first is an anti-carbon sinking site. The idea of carbon sinking is that you store the CO2 in some medium, such as trees. The website argues against this practice and using trees with that practice. I never talked about carbon sinking which is often considered a bad practice but trees help sustain life.One mature tree supports two people. The second is saying something that is just a generally good rule, 'Don't put animals or plants into an enviornment that don't belong there'. The article basically says don't put trees when there has never trees. So instead of trees you restore the enviornment with its natural vegatative life.... I feel like you got in an argument with someone who really wanted cities to turn into some kind of jungle-forest-city thing... which I agree is a dumb idea, because....Rebuttal to Space Limitations and an Answer to Efficient Reforestation:Instead it would be more efficient to make areas of high population density and forested areas. Areas of high population density, New York and Hong Kong, have few to no trees but hold populations comparable to expansive cities like Houston. To be efficient, it would be best to built high-density urban areas that lower CO2 emmisions with smaller transportation infastructure (work is a mile away instead of ten miles away) and allow for the surronding areas to be massive forests.Rebuttal to Economic Loss:I couldn't find too much information on what you were saying of countries wasting massive amount of money currently on reforestation. Most of what I found was similar to what China is doing. Their reforestation to an attempt to rebuild the enviornment they destroyed and nature is having its revenge. Rebuttal to Animals and Humans thing:Again I feel like you talked with someone who wants jungle-city things. Under my former mentioned idea of high-density urban areas and the rest of the world reforested or back to a more original state, would mean that you wouldn't have tigers eating your kids (Hide you kids, hide your wives, because everybody gettin' eatin' up in here)I feel like you argued with someone about jungle-cities which are inefficient and unreasonable.

    <t>Well, for the Second Round, I start with a new point.First of all, I would like to make some clarifications.* The Actual Point of Argument : I never said that 'the number of trees should be made to stay at a relative stable level and for us not to plant more than we use.' I wanted to say that, planting excess trees and turning cities into forests is not at all a good practice.* Relationship Between Animals (wild) and Humans : In this case, animals are considered to be wild. www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIrs_ZXXiLc (it's a You tube Video, though it states my point through a visual approach). Wild animals should be left at a restricted range. They should not be mixed up with human civilization. Now I would like to state the following points, against the topic:* ECONOMIC LOSSNow a days, most countries (as far as I know), plant large number of trees annually, more than an average level. They are influenced by some kind of 'Environment Saving without caring for Development'. They waste their money on buying trees, paying the labourers' salary and some trade taxes (if they import the trees from foreign countries).* LIMITING SPACES AVAILABLE FOR USEMaking a forest in cities, limits the area available for public use. We can use the land for making schools, homes for the poor and/or utilize it for some general welfare of the people. For examples, open grounds for playing should not be covered with tall trees. Or take the example of planting too many trees near the houses. In the long run, the roots of the trees would damage the buildings, the cleaning fallen leaves would be a major problem and the houses would be finally termed as 'haunted' (according to some, though).So I would like to conclude with the following:'Planting trees is good, indeed. But choosing the right type of plant, the right place and the right time is a problem. So, trees must be planted judiciously.</t>
<h> The Actual Point of Argument : I never said that 'the number of trees should be made to stay at a relative stable level and for us not to plant more than we use.' I wanted to say that, planting excess trees and turning cities into forests is not at all a good practice.</h>

    <t>To fully understand you stance, you want the number of trees to stay at a relative stable level and for us not to plant more than we use.  The largest factor in deforestation is slash and burn farming. Areas affected by this need excessive reforestation to deal with the massive decline of nutrients in the soil. Much of the 'farmland' used in the process is wasted. Additionally, without trying to make this a global warming debate, reforestation will help deal with the increase of CO2 in the air. This will help with global warming (if you believe in it). As far as I know, land utilization has not become a global issue yet (in some countries yes, but globally no) so reforestation would not mean getting rid of civilized areas. I think you BoP on saying the globe has can't reforest in a large scale because of land restrictions because I couldn't find anything in either direction which leads me to believe its not really an issue.  The thing with animals and humans together: umm.... I am going to wait for clarification on this. As far as I know, there is not a major issue with animals invading peoples homes in rural areas so I don't see how having trees in urban and suburban areas would be an issue.</t>

    <t>Dear readers,  Today I stand against the topic 'Planting Excess Trees Is A Good Practice'.  Planting Trees is a very good practice, indeed. In this world where the numbers of trees are going down rapidly, trees must be planted in greater numbers. However, anything in excess is not good.  It is true that trees provide us with oxygen, food, shelter and other useful products; but it also snatches away the place to grow crops, the area to build human shelters amongst others. It is said that by build apartment style of buildings, we can save area for planting trees. But I am against this. If this is to be done, what will be the difference between people living in jungles and people living in civilized areas?  Trees are home to millions of animals. But, many of them are poisonous. Turning cities into dense forests would invite them to live with people. I wouldn't be surprised, if in this case, a black widow spider and a man would share the same bed.  Trees must be planted; we cannot do without it. But, they should be planted in reasonable numbers.</t>

    <t>Thanks for accepting the debate!! I am definitely not a debate master like some people on here, but this should be interesting and fun.  Now, just for the sake of complete clarity, I will state my purpose and what I will (try to) prove.  Saying that Obama sucks is saying that he barely did anything right, and botched everything.  I am NOT arguing that Obama was a perfect president, I will express points that prove that he handled many situations well and passed some good policy.  No politician tells the truth 100% of the time, and although I realize that it's terrible for them to lie, please refrain from going over the 'Obama said... but...' arguments because those arguments can be made against practically any politician.   Obama has done a lot of work to help people as president.  I will be detailing his work in civil rights, education, and the environment, but will talk about other aspects in my final argument.  Civil RightsObama has always been a figure for civil rights.  Aside from being the first African American president in United States history, he has passed many laws helping minorities.  He is especially active in LGBT rights.  Very recently, he has announced plans to sign an executive ban on sexual orientation-based discrimination in the workplace [1].  Gays, lesbians etc. are often discriminated against in the workplace, in fact many are fired just because they are gay.  Many lawmakers, however, refuse to admit that it is even a problem.  I know that this isn't representative of all politicians, but there are many anti-gay politicians like Al Melvin who don't even agree that its a problem that LGBT's are being unfairly discriminated against.  Watch an interview of Al by Anderson Cooper here [2] (I was shocked by Al's denial) and thank the lucky stars that we don't have an anti-gay president like that.  Also, Obama works with improving the situation of minorities.  Low income minority families have significant educational and emotional disadvantages, for example, a child raised in a low-income scenario hears about 30 million less words than a child raised in a family with money in only the first 3 years of childhood.  Minorities have had problems, but Obama is passing legistlation to help them get out of their rut with the help of many foundations.  [3] One of his great characteristics is that he relates to people, and isn't afraid to admit that he made many of the mistakes that these minorities have made.  Ability to relate to his fellow countrymen is an important skill for a president to have.  EducationObama knows that smart kids make a smart future.  He has done SO much for education.  This includes increasing funding for the nation's future (smart), initiating Race to the Top (which has helped MILLIONS of kids benefit from higher education standards), and starting programs to aid college students in paying their debts.  No child should worry about affording an education as a reason to not go to college. [4] EnvironmentAgain, Obama is looking to the future in terms of the environment as well.  The president illustrates humour and planning in this speech [5].  His ideas are important, and make sense.  He recognizes global warming as a problem that must be corrected, unlike many lawmakers, and proposes many steps to help solve the problem, unlike many lawmakers.  These steps include limiting the pollution produced by big companies, investing in clean energy technologies, and more savvy steps [6]So my punch line is that Obama has unarguably screwed up on many occasions, just like practically every politician that ever  existed.  And.... just to satisfy me.... I want to say this to the people who say Obama=Hitler, but Severus beat me to it.</t>

    <t>Misty, I am sad that you were unable to provide a response or defense to my argument, but I will pursue to respond, in short (very), to your argument for the sake of validating my own position.  In your argument, you brought three issues that you believe Obama has handled quite well, that removes him from the 'sucks' category: Civil rights, education, and environment. These issues are important, of course, and anyone willing to ignore or downplay these issues is not only deserving of a leadership position, but also damaging their own political success. But,, that is just the point. Anyone can (should) agree that all men are created equal, and thereby subject to the same birth rights as everyone else. Anyone can fight, or merely just appear to fight, for the advancement and improvement of our educational system. And anyone can agree that, aside from the debate of global warming, we as a people need to change the way we produce, consume, and live in order to manage resources and provide waste management. The difference is how a leader and/or his administration go about defining these issues and how best to address them, which is best contrasted in the difference between the political right and left. Ultimately, this is expected, and what one president/party achieve in their term, is easily reverted in the other. These issues will flip back and forth because of the majority's difference of opinion, and how their leaders defend their constituency.  However, the issues that are hard, the ones that leaders don't wish to address publicly with the people are the tough decisions and issues I mentioned above. The advent of global militarization via drones, privacy rights of the individual counter to constitutional provisions, and a flip-flop foreign policy justification for either taking direct action or providing indirect consent for action. Obama has avoided confronting these issues publicly because he believes (I believe) that he is and has been in the wrong on these and other issues, and cannot address these issues, until information on how they are being handled behind the scenes is leaked out. Obama had a chance to make a change, and to undo so many things from the previous Bush administration that he publicly stated were wrong, but sadly, he has not only allowed them, he has advanced them.  I'll give credit where credit is due, he has done, as you mentioned, many great things to better our nation and humanity, but in the end we have to remember that it is not the easy decisions that anyone can make, but how they react to the tough issues, pressures, and circumstances that make or break any leader. In this aspect, Obama has failed in my reasons provided, in addition to many others, both know now, and later to be declassified.</t>

    <t>ResolutionWho should be the next president of the United States -- Bernie Sanders or Rand Paul? Framework Pro will argue that Bernie Sanders should be the next president, whilst Con will argue that Rand Paul should be the next president. Burdens Pro and Con will bear equal burdens of proof. Criterion The criterion, or the way in which 'should' will apply in this debate, will be the betterment of society. For example, Pro will argue that society would be better off with Bernie Sanders as president than with Rand Paul as president. Con will argue that society would be better off with Rand Paul as presdent than with Bernie Sanders as president. Background Bernie Sanders: 'American politician and the junior United States Senator from Vermont. Before serving in the Senate, he represented Vermont's at-large district in the United States  and served as mayor of Burlington, the largest city in Vermont. Sanders is a self-described democratic socialist, and has praised Scandinavian-style socal democracy.' Rand Paul: 'the junior United States Senator for Kentucky. He is a member of the Republican Party and the son of former U.S. Representative and presidential candidate Ron Paul of Texas. He first received national attention in 2008 when making political speeches on behalf of his father, who was campaigning for the Republican Party's nomination for president. During his father's final term in the house, he was the first United States senator to have served simultaneously with a parent in the United States House of Represenatives.' StructureRound 1 Pro will provide the rules, structure, and resolutionCon will offer his opening contentionsRound 2 Pro will offer his opening arguments and will have the chance to rebut Con will offer his first rebuttal Round 3 Pro will offer his first rebuttal Con will offer his final rebuttal and closing remarksRound 4 Pro will offer his final rebuttal and closing remarks Con will post 'Pass' so that both debaters have an even number of rounds Rules1. The rules, stipulations, structure, etc. cannot be changed after the point of acceptance.2. Any deviation from the rules will merit a loss. This is particularly applicable to the rule that Con must pass Round 4 to even out the rounds. 3. Any forfeit will merit a loss.  4. Any definition not found in this opening piece will be taken from a reputable source -- e.g., Merriam Webster.</t>

    <t>I'm going to mostly spend this round to build my own case, largely because I run low on characters and CON hasn't offered any arguments, but has merely stated several of Paul's positions. On top of that there is hardly any specifity or explicit sourcing, so I would ask CON to flesh out his contentions. I'm not responsible for pouring through his sources to discover the contentions he intended to offer. Merely stating that Paul supported X position doesn't mean that Paul should be president; CON needs to tell us how X position would benefit the country and how Paul would be preferable to Sanders.I.  Experience Experence is obviously a critical factor for any presidential hopeful. Congressional gridlock is worse than it has ever been, and the current Congress has been deemed the 'least productive Congress ever,' passing fewer bills than any Congress that preceded it (1). Therefore, a presidential candidate must not only be firm and steadfast in what he stands for, but willing to communicate effectively with members of the opposition party. This requires congressional experience. In much the same way that you would hire a gardener to do gardening work and a plumber to do plumbing work, you would want a politician to do political work. The majority of Senator Paul's career is not as a Senator, but as an optamalogist (2). Bernie Sanders served 14 years in the U.S. House of Representatives before he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2006 (3). This means that he has served in the U.S. Congress for about 24 years, in addition to four terms as Mayor of Burlington (3). Compare this to Rand Paul, who was only elected in 2010 to the U.S. Senate, meaning that he only has 4 years of experience (4). Bernie also serves on five congressional committees -- Budget; Veterans; Energy; Environment; and Health, Education, Labor and Pensions -- and chairs the Veterans committee (3). II. Policy Priorities We should have a president whose prioritizes the issues most critical to the country's survival. Sander's stated priorities are as follows: 'the shrinking middle class and widening income gap in America that is greater than at any time since the Great Depression. Other priorities include reversing global warming, universal health care, fair trade policies, supporting veterans and preserving family farms' (3). By contrast, Rand Paul's priorities are 'term limits, a balanced-budget amendment, a Read the Bills Act, and an audit of the Federal Reserve' (4).  Why hasn't he mentioned climate change, income inequality, healthcare, veterans, etc.? The reason, by and large, is that Rand Paul doesn't believe the government ought to intervene in these issues; he's a 'free market' ideologue who believes that, if government steps out of the way, everything will be beautiful and miraculous. We know from history that this isn't the case: that markets, left to their own devices, are not perfectly efficient, omnibenevolent, omniscient creatures, and this is largely because people are not rational actors, nor do they have perfect information. In fact, we had much larger government from 1945 to 1980, with tax rates between 71 and 94 percent (5), and the economy boomed to the benefit of everyone, not just the very affluent. Sanders has cited this time as his inspiration, whereas Paul chooses to simply ignore it or to deny reality.Paul's priorities, however, are embarassing. Term limits are hardly a relevant issue, especially when initiatives to place them on the ballot have been largely funded by the billionaire Koch brothers (6), oil moguls set on funding misinformation campaigns on climate change (because green enrgy would invite competition to the oil industry), to fighting the minimum wage, the Affordable Care Act, etc. (7). Conveniently, many Koch-funded industries as well as large corporations have contributed to Rand Paul's campaigns over the years (8). The reason they want term limits? The people who would be effected are mostly Democrats. We have term limits: they're called elections. Why in the world would we want to prevent politicians from gaining experience and allow people to make their own decisions? Term limits simply wouldn't fix any problems, especially when we consider the revolving door exists, anyway, and this hardly addresses it, as politicians would simply become lobbyists after their time in office is up.  He is also ignorant of monetary policy, which tells me that his nomination for Fed Chairman -- who would wield an immense amount of power and could literally propel the economy in a permanent slump by following Paul's hawkish rhetoric and raising interest rates -- would be disastrous. He's expressed a fervor that Fed is raising the cost of goods and hurting poor people (9). In supporting and campaigning for his father, who wanted to end the Fed (10), he endorsed a policy that is utterly absurd. It would bring us back to the panics of the 1800s and early 1900s which occured roughly every 20 years, before we had a central bank committed to financial stability (11). His policy of auditing is also misguided. Not only is he dead wrong on inflation -- inflation is only about 2 percent right now, and has consistently been below the Fed's targets in recent years (12), largely because banks have accumulated about $2.5 trillion in excess reserves (13), and his statement that the Fed affects food and gas prices is mendacious (14) -- but the policy he supports (auditing the Fed) would actually cause MORE inflation. There's a wide body of academic literature showing a negative correlation between central bank independence and inflation, most notably from Alesina and Summers (15).A balanced budget amendment is also a joke, as it would force the federal government to adhere to a dogmatic standard at all times -- not factoring in that during a downturn, due to a lack of aggregate demand, the government needs to prime the pump -- which would force through austerity. The negative impacts of austerity on the European periphery are widely known and profound (16), and have even been linked to about 500 suicides in Greece (17). In Greece, austerity actually INCREASED the debt: G.D.P. ratio because as GDP contracted, tax revenues fell which led to an unrelenting cycle of deleveraging and unemployment. An exceptional case against the BBA comes from Paul Krugman, who argues that setting a GDP cap for the federal budget is ludicrous (18). As the economy enters recession and GDP contracts, tax revenues fall. Not only are we taking in less revenue, but now we're taking the same percentage out of a smaller GDP figure. This would impose massive austerity that would have the same effect on the U.S. as it did in Greece: higher debt to G.D.P. ratios and more unemployment. John Maynard Keynes was vindicated after the military buildup for WWII ended the Great Depression (19): spend more during a downturn and cut back during a recession. Sanders believes in this principle, which is part of the reason that he would be an exceptional president economically speaking.  III. Paul is Ignorant of ScienceClimate change is one of the most severe threats to the future of the planet, and has broader economic implications, particularly on food security. There is no debate over whether this is caused by humans: 97.1% of scientific papers on this subject support the fact that it is caused by humans (20). The U.S. military recognizes the danger of climate change (21), arguing that it impacts military readiness and creates missions overseas. Paul, however, is a climate-change denier (22). Though even many conservative economists such as Greg Mankiw and Scott Sumner support a carbon tax, acknowledging the perils of climate change, Paul like the ideologus he is, writes it off because it would require government intervention. Paul said he wants the U.S. to drill in 'every, possible conceivable place' (23). Not only would this ludicrous idea have dire environmental ramifications, but the U.S. is already the world's largest oil producer (24), so Paul isn't even properly diagnosing the problem. Sanders, on the other hand, has considered climate change to be one of our top threats and has been a leader on addressing this issue (25).IV. EconomicsI've already explained why Sanders is good economically speaking: he understands the threat of income inequality and how it impacts middle- and lower-income families. Paul's proposals, however, will merely exacerbate it. I run low on characters so I can't get into this as much as I would like, though it's a central issue to my case so I will expand on it in later rounds. We know that Paul's proposals of even more austeirty and even more tax cuts will merely widen this gap and expand the influence of the rich in politics. Is it not curious that Paul is against abolishing corporate personhood (26) (and is working with Citizens United to abolish the IRS (27) which is corrupting politics, while Sanders has been a leader in ending the Citizens United decision and restoring democracy (28)? Research shows us that the U.S. is becoming an oligarchy (29), and Paul's policies merely exacerbate that.</t>

    <t>I gladly accept this debate. I will be arguing that Rand Paul should be the next United States president instead of Bernie Sanders. I think that one of the best things about both of these people is that they are very close to third parties. Sanders in considered an Independent, and Rand Paul is pretty close to Libertarian. I think that our government under both Bush and Obama, has gotten a little too left or right.  Here is where Rand Paul stands on some issues. - He is for budget cuts. He believes that the government in Washington spends much more than they should. Libertarians believe in limited government. That's where he is on this issue. - He believes that the government should intervene less on education. - He thinks that we should look for solutions to energy right here in America. We should stop spending money in other countries such as Iceland, that have effective alternate energy sources. -He is for military action when it is justified. - He is against Obamacare. - He fully supports legal immigrants who have come here and made a decent life for themselves. However, he is for more strict border security. Almost twelve million people are living in the United States illegally. Why should they be able to stay here illegally when other hard working people come here legally? - He is against gun control. Proposed gun control laws only restrict on responsible gun ownership. Criminals will still be able to obtain guns. - Paul thinks that our Tax Code needs to be reformed. - He is absolutely for helping our veterans.  I agree with Paul on most, if not all of his stances. I think that if he helps enforce his opinions as a president, the country will thrive more a lot more than it has under Obama or Bush.  Let me know some of Bernie Sanders's stances, as well as provide rebuttals.</t>

    <t>My opponent has not made a single argument for his position or a refutation of my arguments. His entire argument in round 3 is a source war (when the debate revolves around the number of sources each debater can put forth). Not only does it not satisfy his burden of proof, it is no way to argue. In this argument, I will first consider his introductory points, then proceed to refute the relevant arguments he made from his first argument, and finally show how his source war does not prove his point, especially on scientific topics.  My opponent has not shown how his arguments are relevant, as he hasn't addressed my arguments as to how they aren't relevant. Also, from the resolution and the arguments you have put forth, you have been arguing that humans have been a significant, if not the main cause of the modern global warming. I've been showing how they're not.  Refutations  Climate Models  Climate models are far from perfect. In fact, they have consistently overestimated warming. 'The computer models predict that the 20th century temperatures should have increased by 1.6 to 3.74 Celsius, while the actual observed 20th-century temperature increase was about 0.6 Celsius. A model that fails to history match is useless for predicting the future.'[1]  Here is a graph showing various climate model predictions to actual temperatures:    'The IPCC models projected the global 17-year SST trend ending August 2011 at 0.15 C/decade, but the observed rise was only 0.02 C/decade... The quoted error on a single measurement is 0.05 C. The probability that the IPCC projections overstate the warming in greater than 90%.' I could go on more about this, but since my opponent has provided no proof of the validity of climate models, this will suffice.[1]  To conclude, here is a prediction made by a climate model:  Built in cooling trend until at least 2024 Temperature Hadsst3 moving average anomaly 2035 - 0.15 Temperature Hadsst3 moving average anomaly 2100 ' 0.5 General Conclusion ' by 2100 all the 20th century temperature rise will have been reversed.[2]  Why should we believe the models that predict excessive warming instead of models that predict a decrease in temperatures.  Water Vapor Feedback  Once again, the predictions to not match up with the observations. The feedback predicts relative humidity to remain constant so that the atmosphere can hold more water vapor with increased temperatures. However, humidity has actually fallen. This doesn't only negate the supposed positive feedback, but if the decrease is large enough, it may actually become a negative feedback.  Here is a graph showing relative humidity over the last 60 years:    'This shows that the actual water vapor content in the upper troposphere has declined by 13.7% (best fit line) from 1948 to 2012 at the 400 mb pressure level. The climate models predict that humidity will increase in the upper troposphere, but the data shows a large decrease; just where water vapor changes have the greatest effect on global temperatures.'[1]  Ocean Acidification  Actually, claims of ocean acidification have been greatly exaggerated and misinterpreted. The mean drop in pH levels as a result of CO2 increases is around 0.3, but the sea can experience changes of almost 1.4 in as little as just a day. 'On a monthly scale the pH varies by 0.024 to 1.430 pH units.''At Puerto Morelos (in Mexico's easternmost state, on the Yucat'n Peninsula) the pH varied as much as 0.3 units per hour due to groundwater springs.''Even the more stable and vast open ocean is not a fixed pH all year round. Hofmann writes that 'Open-water areas (in the Southern Ocean) experience a strong seasonal shift in seawater pH (~0.3'0.5 units) between austral summer and winter.''[3][4]  This is the paper's hypothesis: 'This natural variability has prompted the suggestion that an appropriate null hypothesis may be, until evidence is obtained to the contrary, that major biogeochemical processes in the oceans other than calcification will not be fundamentally different under future higher CO2/lower pH conditions'[3][4]  The Consensus  This argument has employed by pro in both his first argument as an argument, and in this round to support his position. However, both instances commit both a fallacy and a gross inaccuracy.  First, the fallacy. Science does not work by consensus. The number of researchers or organizations has little bearing on whether what they believe is actually true. Michael Crichton has said, 'Consensus is the business of politics. Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world. In science consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus.' My opponent has said that petroleum companies supporting climate change deniers is a conflict of interest, but so are governmental organizations, because legislators want them to provide information that will support the legislation will support. Politics in science hardly makes for objective conclusions.[1]  Even so, the consensus doesn't even exist in the first place. Over 31,000 scientists (with at least a Bachelors' degree in relevant fields) have signed a petition saying that global warming is not anthropogenic. The Heartland Institute has conducted an international survey of 530 climate scientists in 2003. The survey asked if the current state of scientific knowledge is developed well enough to allow for a reasonable assessment of the effects of greenhouse gases. Two-thirds of the scientists surveyed (65.9 percent) disagreed with the statement, with nearly half (45.7 percent) scoring it with a 1 or 2, indicating strong disagreement. Only 10.9 percent scored it with a 6 or 7, indicating strong agreement. Most of the organizations my opponent lists are governmental, meaning that they have that conflict of interest I mentioned earlier.[5][6]  The graphs my opponent provides are either irrelevant, are refuted by my argument against the consensus above, or show a rough correlation between CO2 and temperature that I have already shown to not exist. It is also relevant to note that the r^2 correlation between CO2 and temperature over the last century is only 0.44, which is considered poor.[7]  Also, as for the other greenhouse gases, my opponent has not argued for them specifically, concentrating on CO2 in his arguments. Regardless, I will simply refer to my fourth argument in the last round on greenhouse gas absorption. Methane has an absorption band (at 8 micrometres) that largely overlaps with water vapor, so an increase in methane has little effect on temperature. In addition to methane, the wavelengths of light that nitrous oxide absorb largely overlap with that of water vapor, so an increase in nitrous oxide also has little effect on temperature. Those are the main greenhouse gases. I will address these more if my opponent considers them any more than he has.[1]  Conclusion  My opponent's entire argument in this round is a fallacious attempt to make his position seem valid when he can't refute the arguments I made in the first round. Again, science does not work by consensus, and even so, there really is no 'consensus'. Pro has never gotten near satisfying his BoP that humans are causing climate change.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank CarterWale for presenting his arguments. The resolution is that humans have caused the modern climate change. However, most of my opponent's arguments either deals with the existence of global warming itself, or rules out (rather invalidly) other alternatives. He does very little to actually satisfy his burden of proof that humans are causing global warming. My arguments will be predicated on one simple assumption ' that the vast majority of the claimed human impact is the result of greenhouse gas emissions.  Humans Have Not Caused the Modern Global Warming  There are many indicators that point to CO2 emissions not being the cause of the modern global warming.  First, CO2 is actually a lagging indicator compared to temperature. As it turns out, temperature may be what's causing CO2 levels to rise. 'The most recent study on this concluded that the results of their tedious but meticulous analysis led them to ultimately conclude that 'the CO2 increase lagged Antarctic deglacial warming by 800 +/- 200 years.' There is also shorter correlations, but again, temperature seems to cause CO2 rise instead of the reverse.[1]  This graph shows just one of the lags:    [1]  Second, according to the greenhouse effect, global warming should be starting from the lower atmosphere and moving to the surface (because the CO2 collects in the upper troposphere first). However, this is not happening. '...satellite and high-altitude balloon data confirm that the lower atmosphere is not trapping lots of additional heat due to higher CO2 concentrations. It is hard to know how fast the Earth's highly variable surface is warming, but it is warming faster than the lower atmosphere where the CO2 is accumulating. This is strong evidence that CO2 is not the primary climate factor.'[2]  Here is a graph showing how the surface has warmed more than the troposphere:    [1] (Blue line is lower troposphere temperature)  Third, global warming is not starting at the poles like it should be, by the greenhouse theory. In fact, there has been general, relative cooling: 'If the greenhouse theory were valid, temperatures in the Arctic and the Antarctic would have risen several degrees Celsius since 1940 due to the huge emissions of man-made CO2... Recently, a team led by the University of Chicago's Peter Doran published a paper in Nature saying, 'Although previous reports suggest recent continental warming, our spatial analysis of Antarctic meteorological data demonstrates a net cooling on the Antarctic continent between 1966 and 2000'. The data from 21 Antarctic surface stations show an average continental decline of 0.008 degrees C from 1978 to 1998, and the infrared data from satellites operating since 1979 show a decline of 0.42 degrees C per decade. David W. J. Thompson of Colorado State University and Susan Soloman of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration also report a cooling trend in the Antarctic interior. ... report that satellite imaging shows increases in Southern Ocean sea ice parameters from 1978 to 1996 and an increase in the length of the sea-ice season in the 1990s.'[2]  To illustrate, here is a picture of the southern hemisphere sea ice anomaly, which shows that southern sea ice is actually increasing:    [3]  Fourth, current levels of CO2 have very little effect on temperature. The greenhouse effect certainly exists, but it doesn't become linearly stronger with increasing amounts of CO2. CO2's effect on temperature is logarithmic, meaning that each additional increase has a smaller effect on the climate than the last. 'The carbon that is already up in the atmosphere absorbs most of the light it can. CO2 only soaks up its favorite wavelengths of light and it's close to its saturation point. It manages to grab a bit more light from wavelengths that are close to its favorite bands but it can't do much more, because there are not many left-over photons at the right wavelengths.'[1][4]  This chart shows approximately the effect that each additional increment of CO2 increase has on temperature:    [4]  Note how the pre-industrial to modern level increase has had less than a 0.2 C increase in temperature.  Fifth and most importantly, the predicted 'hot-spot' 10 miles above the tropics that would be a signature of CO2-induced global warming is absent. 'The computer models show that greenhouse warming will cause a hot-spot at an altitude between 8 and 12 km over the tropics between 30 N and 30 S. The temperature at this hot-spot is projected to increase at a rate of two to three times faster than at the surface. However, the Hadley Centre's real-world plot of radiosonde temperature observations shown below does not show the projected CO2 induced global warming hot-spot at all. The predicted hot-spot is entirely absent from the observational record. This shows that atmosphere warming theory programmed into climate models are wrong.'[1]  Here is the plot of predicted temperature changes due to CO2:    However, here is the actual observed temperature changes:    [1]  The hot spot is completely missing, which is pretty much a knockout blow to the anthropogenic global warming theory.  Even so, CO2 has not correlated well with the climate anyway. Throughout the past 600 million years, almost one-seventh of the age of the Earth, the mode of global surface temperatures was ~22C, even when carbon dioxide concentration peaked at 7000 ppmv, almost 20 times today's near-record-low concentration.  Here is a graph showing CO2 concentrations versus temperature over the past 600 million years:    [1]  Note especially how high CO2 concentrations were earlier in Earth's history, reaching as high as 7000 ppmv. It was around 4500 ppmv during the very cold Ordovician era.  Considering My Opponent's Arguments  I was going to wait until the next round to consider his arguments, but after reading them, I thought I would discredit the majority of pro's arguments, as they aren't even worth arguing against.  Arguments 1-3 are irrelevant - they don't show how human-emitted greenhouse gases have caused global warming. Argument 4 eliminates (rather invalidly) that the sun is not causing global warming ' that still doesn't show that humans are causing global warming. Arguments 5 and 6 are relevant and I will consider them. Arguments 7 and 9-12 just show evidence for global warming ' not anthropogenic global warming. Arguments 8, 13, and 14 will be considered.  So essentially, only arguments 5, 6, 8, 13, and 14 are relevant to the resolution that pro made. All the rest either only prove global warming itself or demonstrate that humans have caused the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, and so have no bearing on a debate considering anthropogenic global warming.  I will consider those relevant arguments and those arguments only in the next round, along with any objections pro has to my own arguments. </t>

    <t>Main point - Every major science academy in the west supports it, 97%-98% of scientist support it.  1. 75% of the 20th century increase in the atmospheric greenhouse gas CO2 is directly caused by human actions like burning fossil fuels. CO2 levels were 389ppm (parts per million) as of Apr. 2010 - the highest they have been in the past 650,000 years. This increase in CO2 was a substantial contributor to the 1'F to 1.4'F warming over the 20th century.  2. Human-produced CO2 is warming the earth, not natural CO2 released from the ocean and other 'carbon sinks.' CO2 from fossil fuel combustion has a specific isotopic ratio that is different from CO2 released by natural 'carbon sinks.' 20th century measurements of CO2 isotope ratios in the atmosphere confirm that the rise results from human activities, not natural processes.  3. Human produced greenhouse gases will continue to accumulate in the atmosphere causing climate change because the earth's forests, oceans, and other 'carbon sinks' cannot adequately absorb them all. As of 2009, these carbon sinks were only absorbing about 50% of human-produced CO2. The other 50% is accumulating in the atmosphere.  4. Human greenhouse gas emissions, not changes in the sun's radiation, are causing global climate change. Measurements in the upper atmosphere from 1979 - 2009, show the sun's energy has gone up and down in cycles, with no net increase. While warming is occurring in the troposphere (lower atmosphere), the stratosphere (upper atmosphere) is cooling. If the sun was driving the temperature change there would be warming in the stratosphere also, not cooling.  5. Computer models show that increased levels of human produced greenhouse gases will cause global warming and other climate changes. Although these climate models are uncertain about how much future warming will occur and how it will affect the climate, they all agree that, to some degree, these changes will happen. The reality of climate change is not contradicted by this uncertainty.  6. Although the amount of human-produced greenhouse gases may seem small to some people, their warming potential is amplified by the water vapor positive feedback loop , allowing them to cause significant warming and climate change. As greenhouse gases heat the planet, increased humidity (water vapor in the atmosphere) results. Since water vapor is itself a greenhouse gas, it can double the warming effect of greenhouse gases such as CO2.  7. Human greenhouse gas emissions are heating the planet, and climate models consistently show that this warming causes an increase in the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones. The fact that 1975-1989 had 171 category 4 and 5 hurricanes while 1990-2004 had 269 [51] of them (a 57% increase) validates these climate models and the reality of human-induced climate change.  8. Human-produced CO2 is changing the climate of the world's oceans. As excess CO2 is absorbed, oceanic acidity levels increase. Oceans have absorbed 48% of the total CO2 released by human activities and acidity levels are 25-30% higher than prior to human fossil fuel use.  9. An 8' rise in the ocean level has occured (1961-2003) due to human-induced global warming. Global sea levels rose an average of 1.8 mm (.07 in) per year between 1961 and 2003 and at an average rate of about 3.1 mm (.1 in) per year from 1993 to 2003. [3] This sea level rise is the result of warming waters and the melting of glaciers, ice caps, and polar ice sheets. From 1870-2004, a 'significant acceleration' of sea-level rise occured, an important confirmation of climate change models.  10. Warming caused by human-produced greenhouse gases is changing the earth's hydrologic climate. Rainfall is increasing in many areas due to increased evaporation stemming from global warming. Higher temperatures are also causing some mountainous areas to receive rain rather than snow. According to researchers at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, up to 60% of the changes in river flow, winter air temperature, and snow pack in the western US (1950-1999) were human-induced.  11. Warming caused by human-produced greenhouse gases is changing the rate of glacial melt and altering the local climate of many regions. Since 1850, records show a 'strong increase' in the rate of glacial retreat. From 1961-2004 glaciers retreated about .5mm per year in sea level equivalent. According to the World Glacier Monitoring Service, since 1980, glaciers worldwide have lost nearly 40 feet (12 meters) in average thickness (measured in average mass balance in water equivalent).  12. Warming caused by human-produced greenhouse gases and soot (black carbon) produced from burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, is reducing the size of the Arctic ice cap. A smaller ice cap reflects less of the sun's energy away from the earth. This energy is absorbed instead, causing air and water temperatures to rise. From 1953'2006, Arctic sea ice declined 7.8% per decade. Between 1979 and 2006, the decline was 9.1% each decade. Climate models predict that Arctic sea ice will continue to retreat through the 21st century further disrupting the global climate. [15]  13. Many organizations believe that human activity is a substantial cause of global climate change. These groups include: the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the InterAcademy Council, the Network of African Science Academies, the European Science Foundation (ESF), the European Space Agency (ESA), the Royal Society (UK national academy of science), the US National Academies of Science, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  14. Nearly all climate change studies show humans as the main cause, and studies which contradict this claim are often funded by petroleum companies, making their conclusions suspect given the obvious conflict of interest. From 2004-2005, ExxonMobil gave $2.2 million in grants for climate change research to organizations that deny human caused climate change. In 2006 US Senators Olympia Snowe (R-ME), and Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) chastised ExxonMobil for providing more than $19 million in funding to over 29 'climate change denial front groups.'</t>

    <t>I hope this will be a fun and interesting debate with whoever accepts this challenge. First, is global warming actually happening? According to NASA, the average temperature has raised by 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880. According to the United Nations, the past two decades have been the hottest in more than 400 years. Arctic ice is rapidly disappearing, and the region may have its first completely ice-free summer by 2040 or earlier. Polar bears and indigenous cultures are already suffering from the sea-ice loss. Glaciers and mountain snows are rapidly melting'for example, Montana's Glacier National Park now has only 27 glaciers, versus 150 in 1910. In the Northern Hemisphere, thaws also come a week earlier in spring and freezes begin a week later. An upsurge in the amount of extreme weather events, such as wildfires, heat waves, and strong tropical storms, is also attributed in part to climate change by some experts.  Second, are humans causing global warming? The report, based on the work of some 2,500 scientists in more than 130 countries, concluded that humans have caused all or most of the current planetary warming. Human-caused global warming is often called anthropogenic climate change. Humans are pouring carbon dioxide into the atmosphere much faster than plants and oceans can absorb it.  Third, what is likely to occur in the future? Sea level could rise between 7 and 23 inches by century's end. Rises of just 4 inches could flood many South Seas islands and swamp large parts of Southeast Asia. Some hundred million people live within 3 feet of average sea level, and much of the world's population is concentrated in vulnerable coastal cities. In the U.S., Louisiana and Florida are especially at risk. Glaciers around the world could melt, causing sea levels to rise while creating water shortages in regions dependent on runoff for fresh water. Strong hurricanes, droughts, heat waves, wildfires, and other natural disasters may become commonplace in many parts of the world. The growth of deserts may also cause food shortages in many places.

    <t>I do not deny that there has been an increase of temperatures since the mid 1800’s, nor will I deny that CO2 emissions have increased over the same period. What I do take an  issue with is the claim that the increase of CO2 emissions is the cause of the warming in the last 100 or so years.   1. Climate sensitivity   The direct effect of CO2 on warming has been demonstrated in laboratories time and time again. The fact is, the greenhouse effect is real and that an increase in CO2 will lead to some warming, the question still remains: how much.   The direct effect from CO2 is not significant. CO2, which has a logarithmic warming effect, becomes less potent per each molecule of CO2 emitted each molecule that is created. All in all, the direct effect of CO2 leads to insignificant warming amounts. AGW proponents claim that there are positive feedbacks--i.e. amplifiers. The small added warming from the CO2 causes a chain of reactions and the warming increases exponentially, causing a runaway greenhouse effect. Generally, alarmists claim that doubling CO2 with the added effects lead to about 3.3 degrees C of warming, whereas skeptics claim it will be much less: with some estimates around 1 degree C, others at 0.5-0.6 degrees C [1]. If alarmists are correct, CO2 likely caused the majority of the 20th century warming. If skeptics are correct, CO2 has played a negligible role in the recent warming and will continue to play a negligible role in the future.   Now, what does the data argue on this issue? Alarmists base their predictions on climate models. Climate models model temperature based on data that climate modelers--who are not always scientists--put inside the computer. The issue is that this method of data is flawed. How do we get these alarmist predictions? A lot of climate models exist. They all meet together--all the modelers--to compare their data. Some models produce little warming, others produce a lot. They then claim the real answer is in between, they choose one of the middle answers. However, this may not be the correct answer. The fact is, the answer could be any of the models, or none of them at all, however they merely claim it must me the middle answer, which as you can see, is a flawed approach to such a complex system.   The above statements can be evidenced by a simple fact: the models are wrong. The vast majority of models produce too much sensitivity, and the average ‘middle ground’ is significantly above observed temperatures [2]. There is significant scientific evidence published in the peer reviewed academic research that argues the sensitivity predicted by the alarmists is incorrect, and that we should expect minimal warming from doubling of CO2 emissions [3].   2. Climate predictions have been wrong for the last decade  A theory is as good as its predictions. You make a hypothesis, predict what you think is going to happen, and compare the actual data. If your predictions are off, you need to change the hypothesis. The fact is, AGW predictions have been off and need to be corrected to claim the effect of humans is much smaller than once thought.   Warming in the last decade has been far below the expected temperature increase. There has been either no warming, or even cooling [4]. During this period, the IPCC high, low, and ‘best’ estimate all were higher than what was observed. Using AGW theory, this was not predictable. However, believing that oceanic cycles [5], or the sun [6], caused significant warming in the last 100 years, this change in temperature is wholly reasonable. Therefore, at least for the last decade, the natural causes of climate change correlate better than the anthropogenic ones.   Another very important prediction is the existence of a tropospheric hotspot. Models significantly overestimate the tropospheric hotspot. When you look at the actual data, there has been minimal warming in the troposphere [8]. Further, on nearly every altitude, the actual data show the atmosphere significantly cooler than predicted [12].   3. Possible Natural Causes  The natural cause I will be supporting in this debate is the solar cause. The sun causing climate change makes sense: it is the sole source of heat on this planet, the other sources have either unknown causes or merely amplify the suns effect. The sun, however, directly and indirectly causes climate change.   The length of the solar cycle has been correlated to temperature throughout the 20th century. Direct sunlight, cosmic rays, magnetic fields, short and long term solar cycles, all easily explain--and contribute--to climate change [7]. As geologist Bob Carter notes, “the argument advanced by the IPCC… [that] the sun cannot play a major role in global warming or cooling trends--is incorrect.”[8] Recent research by Willie Soon and David Legates, using new and improved TSI (total solar irradiance) measuring techniques definitively conclude that the sun causes the majority of recent climate change. Further, they correct their previous research, and answer the ‘missing link’ question which was formulated in Soon, 2009. Their conclusion states that there exists strong evidence of a solar to climate relationship, and argues that models need to include the possibility of a strong solar forcing [9]. A summary of recent research argues that “[t]he Sun may have contributed as much as 66% of  the observed twentieth century warming, and perhaps more. … IPCC models do not incorporate important solar  factors such as fluctuations in magnetic intensity  and overestimate the role of human-related CO2 forcing.”[10]  However, I have mainly been talking about TSI, which does cause a significant amount of climate change. Other, more indirect, sources of energy from the sun do cause climate change. The most well known of these is the cosmic ray hypothesis. Cosmic rays cause climate change through cloud formation. How do cosmic rays cause cloud formation?  Cosmic rays come in from outer space. TSI alone cannot explain warming throughout all of history, it is commonly accepted that it needs a modifier, so, how do cosmic rays modify the sun’s rays? As these rays hit earth, they are something which molecules use to create clouds. The correlation between cloud formation and cosmic rays is clear. The more cosmic rays, the more clouds, clouds as a negative feedback cool the earth, therefore more cosmic rays = cooler earth. The fewer cosmic rays, the fewer clouds, and a warmer earth. So, lets examine this theory. As the sun is more active, a stronger solar wind exists and pushes the rays away, reducing the amount of cosmic rays--a warmer earth. As the sun cools down, the less wind, a cooler earth. Let’s examine this theory [11]:  1) Cosmic rays cause cloud formation: Significant evidence exists of the cosmic ray-cloud formation link. According to research in the early 21st century, there exists a close correlation between cosmic rays and cloud formation. The more rays, the more clouds. Cosmic rays, therefore, are related to cloud formation.  2) Cosmic ray-temperature correlation: On a geologic timescale, there is a very strong correlation between cosmic rays and temperature. During the phanerozoic, there exists a near perfect correlation between cosmic rays and temperature.   3) Clouds serve as a negative feedback: Clouds need to be a negative feedback in order for this theory to be strong. The data on sensitivity above already agree with this assertion. Clouds, which is one of the largest feedbacks, is primarily negative.   So, to summarize, cosmic rays cause cloud formation, cosmic rays correlate to temperature, clouds have decreased, clouds are a negative feedback which means more cosmic rays cool the earth, and fewer warm it. Cosmic rays are a viable candidate in the search for a cause for climate change.   Conclusion:  Based on the failure to predict phenomena, low climate sensitivity making it nearly impossible for CO2 to have a significant warming effect, and strong evidence for a solar link contributing to the majority of recent warming, I see it unlikely that AGW theory is correct. Climate change happens, whether we want it to or not. The climate is changing, and humans are affecting it, but our influence is negligible when compared to strong natural factors. </t>

    <t>1. Greenhouse effect No one denies, let alone disputes, that the greenhouse effect exists and keeps the warm much warmer. What is under dispute is how much of the greenhouse effect, related to human emissions, causes climate change. My opponent keeps claiming that the effect of this is significant, but as I have shown, this is not the case. I have provided multiple studies which refute climate alarmism: high climate sensitivity. About half of the greenhouse effect which alarmists are worried about is due to clouds. If this is not the case, human induced climate change is extremely small. Observational evidence contradicts the positive feedback cloud assumption that the IPCC and others assume, making it very unlikely that greenhouse gasses have caused significant warming in the 20th century [1]. Further, if the climate was so sensitive to CO2, we would see this correlation  in the geologic record. However, when you look at the record, CO2 either shows no correlation or lags temperature increases. If CO2 was a large driver of climate, we would not see no correlation in the data. There have been periods where it is extremely warm with little CO2, and periods where it is cold with a high amount of CO2. But how do we know that CO2 is not a significant part of the greenhouse effect? Simple, actually. Even using IPCC estimates, human emissions only account for 0.45% of the greenhouse warming in a particular year, which means humans have only contributed to 0.1 degrees C of warming in the 20th century, or about 1/7th. To put it in other words, 99.55% of the greenhouse effect has nothing to do with human carbon emissions. How, then, could CO2, without significant positive feedback (which my opponent has not proven) cause global climate change? The fact is, sensitivity is extremely low in relation to CO2, and therefore humans have a very insignificant impact on global warming [2].  Further, her argument as to how strong the greenhouse effect is--which is correct--focuses on the wrong gas. In fact, water vapor, not CO2 or other man-produced emissions are the largest cause of the greenhouse effect. Further, the vast majority of all of these gasses is not man made. My opponent claims feedbacks are positive, but this is unlikely the case. Clouds, the largest feedback mechanism we know of, decreases the amount of radiation which hits the earths surface, which means that as CO2 causes more clouds (based on AGW theory), the feedback is negative, which often cancels out the warming from greenhouse gasses. Strong evidence suggests that, '[n]et feedbacks in the real climate system — on both short and long time scales — are probably negative.'[3]To argue that the climate system is insensitive to CO2 does not claim that the climate is not sensitive to anything. If specific feedbacks caused by CO2 is negative that does not mean the climate will remain in stasis or cooling. Clouds, a negative feedback, actually support the cosmic ray theory--which my opponent has ignored. The clouds in the case of CO2 will cause cooling, however, cosmic rays create clouds. If the sun is more active, fewer cosmic rays reach earth, and reduce cloud cover. Reduced cloud cover means a lower albedo, which leads to warming. In fact, the climate system is very sensitive to fluctuations of cosmic rays, and cosmic rays are a viable canidate for the majority of the recent warming [4]. AGW theory claims that the decrease in cloud cover is caused by the small warming from CO2, which means more light hits the surface, and more warming. However, they are confusing cause and effect. How do they know that warming caused the clouds to decrease, and not vice-versa? Do clouds cause temperature change, or does temperature change cause clouds? Observational evidence supports the first: clouds cause temperature change. This means that it is a negative feedback in the case of CO2, and a positive one in the case of a cosmic ray flux. Research has demonstrated that the climate is very sensitive to changes in cosmic rays, which amplifies the solar effect greatly [5]. The graph my opponent has is from the IPCC 2007 report, it attempts to display the different causes of climate change by demonstrating how sensitive the climate is to each forcing, and, therefore, how much of the recent warming was caused by each forcing. However, this graph is based on models which have failed to reproduce observed data. They cannot explain the pause in warming, they describe feedbacks (see clouds) incorrectly, their sensitivity is off, their predictions so far are off, they fail to incorporate cosmic ray flux and other natural forcings, etc. The graph only takes into account irradience. But ignores... Magnetic fields, Earth rotation, cosmic rays, and 1500 year cycles. The argument that solar forcings only affect climae through irradience, or that the sun has little effect, is not supported by the facts [6]. The graph underestimates the effect of clouds which is likely significant, and overestimates the effect from CO2. Further, the graph ignores things humans do to cool the climate (aerosols, for example). 2. Added emissionsDroughts always happen, crops aren't dying they're thriving, and if the third world were to develop proper government systems they would be able to clean the water sources and increase the amount of usable water. The GMO argument proves my point... If climate change is real and we are affected, humans will adopt technologies to support our society, increase efficiency, and feed the world. I don't see how that is a negative! Further, as I argued with other empirical evidence, increased CO2 will benefit agriculture and reduce the strains which we have currently put on it. Recent increasing crop yields occured regardless of GMO's. The first GMO crop was tested in 1986, and the first tests in America began in 1987 [7]. Therefore it is safe to assume GMO's were not used in crops until the late 1980s or early 1990s. Crop yields have been increasing since at least 1960, and after the introduction of GMO's I dont see a faster increase in crop yields [8]. The fact is, warming will increase agriculture and reduce deaths. Warming, as demonstrated by observations not models, actually increases precipitation and reduces the water crisis--helping crops. Efforts to reduce emissions would actually harm people around the world, not help them [9]. Dropped argumentsMy opponent has dropped all of my arguments regarding a natural cause. The more caused by nature, the less caused by humans. If nature as I demonstrated has the power to warm the world significantly, and as I demonstrated is a very viable suspect in the cause of warming, AGW theory is thrown out the window. Further, AGW's predictions fail. The true mark of a theory is without doubt its ability to predict phenomena.– Science and Hebrew Tradition, “On the Method of Zadig,” p. 20 [10]. AGW failed to predict the warming pause since 1997, cooling since 2001, and all models predict too much warming. If AGW theory cannot predict what has happened, that means the conclusion is false, and should be revised. The fact that it hasn't isnt science, its turned into politics. ConclusionAGW theory fails on all accounts. Humans play a very negligible role in global warming. Feedbacks are negative, natural causes much better explain the recent warming, AGW has made false predictions, the pause weakens the case for AGW, and the tropospheric hotspot is gone, it doesn't exist. The fact is, the scientific case for AGW is non-existent. Vote CON1. Roy Spencer.

    <t>1. Greenhouse EffectThe argument that you seem to consistently use argues largely against the idea that the majority of the greenhouse effect is caused by water vapor. That, I do not dispute. The issue is not whether or not the greenhouse effect's human contributions cause warmth, but whether they cause active warming. The greenhouse effect has been around since practically the beginning of time on Earth. Therefore the Earth remains largely stagnant in it's temperature; or else, it should. While most of the warmth on Earth from the greenhouse effect comes from water vapor, the same is not true for the warming of the Earth. You previously stated that you attributed warmth to sun flares; 'The natural cause I will be supporting in this debate is the solar cause.' [1]. I previously cited a source that reliably stated that the climate was actually more sensitive towards CO2 due to positive feedbacks than it was towards solar causes. [2] Many sources cite positive feedback trends, and this graph too supports the thought, in demonstrating that as time has gone on, and CO2 has become more prominent in the atmosphere, the temperature of the ocean has risen in response to feedbacks, which are largely caused by the ocean. [3]  'Climate feedbacks are processes that change as a result of a change in forcing, and cause additional climate change. An example of this is the 'ice-albedo feedback.' As the atmosphere warms, sea ice will melt. Ice is highly reflective, while the underlying ocean surface is far less reflective. The darker ocean will absorb more heat, getting warmer and making the Earth warmer overall. A feedback that increases an initial warming is called a 'positive feedback.' A feedback that reduces an initial warming is a 'negative feedback.' The ice-albedo feedback is a very strong positive feedback that has been included in climate models since the 1970s.' [3]  As for no evidence of CO2 causing warmer temperatures...   In fact, as CO2 in the atmosphere becomes more prominent, clouds form more slowly and less. [4]When the climate is highly sensitive to CO2, that is precisely what you are arguing. The IPCC has released a report regarding the inaccuracey of their predictions. It states several reasons why climate change is so unpredictable, and therefore possible reasons for why they were wrongs; forcing agents applied to the climate, geographical and vertical distributions, nature, the magnitude of feedbacks, and the mean climate state, among other things [5]. As these things are not solidly predictable, it's not exactly rocket science. It's a bit like the local news weather anchors, you see. 2. Added emissions True, true due to Monsanto amp; friends, and agreed. I hope we can also agree that they don't need the government's help. I personally believe it is, and that we will be drastically affected. I, simply put, do see how that is negative. There are certain things. I spent the entire day today sitting in my garden on a lawn chair, reading, drinking tea, and watering my plants. I spend the summer hiking, swimming, running through the woods. I take naps on a broken generator in the middle of my raspberry patch, surrounded by lilacs swooning over the blooming patch watching bright blue Colorado sky. Call me crazy, but I have no intention to deny the future generations this leisure. It may make it easier, it may increase our efficiency, but really, are we creating a world that you WANT to live in with that? I think that would be a world closer to F451, a haunting book that hits too close to home. Dropped Arguments Sorry, I guess I did. I sort of created my own arguments on the grounds that your argument didn't really affect my argument. I have absolutely no doubt that natural causes do contribute to climate changes in a sense, and do certainly speed it up, but they are not as pronounced as human changes. According to this, the natural changes would have created a much cooler environment than we are experiencing at the moment :    Failure to predict something doesn't make the theory wrong in all counts. Saying that the weather man got something wrong doesn't make meterology completely false. Conclusion Anthropogenic global warming is a case supported by 97% [6] of scientists, and by all reasonable accounts. My evidence has demonstrated positive feedbacks, and poor supports for natural causes. Several false predictions do not discount an entire, nearly universally accepted theory; nearly as true as evolution. AGW is a completely valid and most definitely true scientific phenomenon.</t>

    <t>1. Greenhouse effect   The greenhouse exists and contributes to some of the warming, that fact is not debated. However, the significance of this effect is.   The fact is, the direct effect from man-made gases cannot, alone, cause climate change. In order to come with the estimates of human induced climate change positive feedback mechanisms must exist. If the response is neutral, or negative, it is very unlikely that added greenhouse gases from man have a significant effect. If there are no feedbacks--an insensitive climate, “this means that the extra carbon dioxide we pump into the atmosphere is not enough to cause the observed warming over the last 100 years”[1].   So, as argued in my sensitivity argument, the debate is not whether or not there is some impact of CO2, it is not whether or not the greenhouse effect exists, it is a question of feedbacks. If my opponent cannot demonstrate a sensitive climate system, the primary mechanism for AGW theory--the direct effect being amplified to a significant level--AGW is impossible.   Research  indicates either a system with few positive feedbacks or negative ones. A study in the journal Climate Research found that climate sensitivity was only 1.8 degrees C, and could possibly be lower [2]. New research done in 2012 found a median sensitivity of 1.1 degrees C [3], which replicates a study published in Energy and Environment in 2009 [4]. The researchers in Eamp;E claimed that their evidence demonstrated a no feedback climate system with carbon dioxide. Research in 2009 and 2011 in Asia-Pacific Journal of Atmospheric Science demonstrated negative feedbacks, with mean climate sensitivity of 0.7 degrees C [5]. Assuming negative climate feedbacks, the greenhouse effect is only responsible for one third of the warming since 1979, which is a crippling blow to the theory of AGW [6].   2. Causes of emissions   I have little doubt that the recent CO2 emissions are in fact caused by man. Although there is some doubt to this theory [7], I find the doubt not convincing. However, believing that CO2 is mainly emitted by man is not endangering the arguments I have made above.   3. Effects of added emissions   Other than the temperature predictions my opponent claims (and 1.5 as the lower estimate, if true, would actually refute AGW, this is why alarmists generally choose 2-3 degrees C), this section is irrelevant. The temperature predictions are already refuted under my extensive climate sensitivity argument and rebuttal.   But I will refute her other arguments just for fun.   The argument we are running out of water is false. The oceans create water through evaporation every day, and rain gives us enough fresh water every day for a decade. The reason we are ‘running out of water’ is because it is not raining in our reservoirs. Our cities are placed where it rained 100 years ago, which has temporarily made a ‘crisis’. But this is treated by merely shipping the water. The costs of water may increase, but is it not going to run out or be catastrophic. And as the weather changes, as will the rain, meaning certain areas will gain water others will lose it. Further, all coastal settlements, if they actually did run out of water, could merely filter ocean water. The vast majority of sea level rise will not affect food production. Satellite data shows although some regions have seen sea level rise, globally, the trend is insignificant and in many areas nonexistent [8].   The fact GMO’s are keeping food production normal is actually an argument against alarm. It demonstrated that new technology will cause us to adapt and mitigate any plausible damages from climate change. As the world changes, humans adapt, and make up for the change. Her argument really shows us how brilliant humans are, really. However, research dispels the myth of falling food production. In fact, CO2 and crop yields correlate almost perfectly: more CO2, more crop yields--this is even including the period before GMO’s. And research shows crop yields should be expected to increase as emissions and temperature increases. Rice, depending on the genotype, increases yields from 2-180% at 570 ppm. In areas where agriculture has overused the land, research shows CO2 enrichment can increase plant growth and counter the lack of nitrogen and phosphorus in the soil. And in the case of drought, more CO2 increases plant efficiency and reduces the need for water [9]. These facts show that increases CO2 and temperature will benefit the planet, not harm it.</t>

    <t>1. Greenhouse Effect In the past 100 years, as this graph quite clearly illustrates, CO2 has at least doubled.The impact of that was previously illustrated, as being between 1.5 to 4.5 degrees C. As the temperature in the past 100 years has risen 1.53 degrees F, clearly that sort of impact is completely possible.I will now explain why.The climate is very sensitive to greenhouse gases, contrary to my opponent's argument. Without greenhouse gases, it is speculated that the earth would freeze. [1] Until the last couple of hundred years, anthropogenic global warming was obsolete; everything was simply climate.Without taking into account feedbacks, the warming would be around 1.25 degrees C. [2]Once feedback is taken into account, it then rises to the now three times stated 1.5 to 4.5 degrees C. Feedback is basically saying that as the Earth warms, the Earth (namely the ocean) absorbs the warmth, thereby keeping the Earth in a cycle of warmth, by releasing more heat into the atmosphere [3] Therefore, even if the effect of greenhouse gases are minimal, at only around 1 degree C, the effect that those subsequent feedbacks have, and then the warmth thereby warming the Earth again creating more feedback, is quite dramatic. [3]By arguing that the climate is insensitive to CO2, you thereby argue that the climate, in and of itself, is insensitive. This would make it insensitive to what you argue that it IS sensitive towards; such as the solar irradiance, volcanoes, etc.. While the Earth is not as sensitive as sometimes brought up to be, everything is as obsolete in changing the Earth's temperature as you claim CO2 is. This figure basically says that the Earth is more sensitive to CO2 than it is to solar instances. I know it's ridiculously hard to read, and to be honest, I have been staring at it for about 15 minutes, and still barely understand it, but that is what it says [4]. It is also hard to argue climate sensitivity at the level you seem to be inferring towards, when you look at past instances. On average, the temperature changes 6 degrees C through each interglacial period, which is tough to explain when arguing that the climate is insensitive. [4]2. Causes of EmissionsI would concur. 3. Effects of Added Emmisons Perhaps running out of water was a bad choice of words. I would have more aptly said 'experiencing water shortages', as 'running out of water' implies that water is leaving our Earth, which of course, is impossible except for the water taken to space by astronauts, which is negliible, and rock colliding into other rock, which happens at an obscenely low level. I therefore won't attempt to refute your refution, because it's entirely valid. I will defend my re-iteration of my statement quite briefly. Droughts have riddled our country [5] and many others, especially hurting vegetation prices in the U.S.A.. [6] Many crops are dying all around the globe, as stated, and we are experiencing a global crisis of getting people in 3rd world legitimate water. [7]I would rather we not get into an argument about GMOs. This is not the topic of the debate, and frankly, one side thinks the other is paranoid, while on the other side thinks the first side is apathetic towards overwhelming evidence. While quite simply, CO2 = more crops, on a more intense level, it only would do so for a backyard garden or irrigated crops. The warming from CO2 is causing droughts, thereby causing, admittedly slightly lower crop productions for non-GMOs. As I said, crop production is NOT falling, however, the only reason it hasn't gone down about 5% is because of GMOs, which have taken it up around 30%. [8] Severe drought won't help a plant, it will kill it, though I will admit that GMOs and more CO2 will decrease water need (though not to the point where a literal lack of water would not harm it at all).</t>

    <t>I will argue that CO2 is the largest contribution to global warming, at 72% [1] of greenhouse gas emissions, and that greenhouse gas emissions are a major contributor to global warming. 1. The Greenhouse EffectNearly all of the temperature increase observed in the past 50 years is due to a rapid increase in greenhouse gases [2] that cause a phenomenon called 'the greenhouse effect'. When sunlight reaches the Earth, a small proportion of it is absorbed into the Earth, and subsequently the Earth is warmed. Most of the sun rays reverberate back into the atmosphere, and usually back out into space. Greenhouse gases, such as methane, CO2, and nitrous oxide absorb some of the sun rays as they go back out into space. As a result, the atmosphere is warmed, and subsequently, the Earth. Much of the cause of the greenhouse effect is water vapor, such as clouds. [3]This is not a part of global warming, however, because ever since water existed on planet Earth, this water vapor has been present, and therefore, while it contributes to the warmth of the Earth, does not contribute to the rise in the Earth's temperature, which in the past 100 years, has gone up about 1.53 F [4]. 2. Causes of EmissionsThe majority of emissions is CO2, as was previously stated to be at 72%. Then comes methane, at 18%, and nitrous oxide at 7%. The remaining 3% is other assorted emissions that are not particularly important in this debate. The biggest causes of the emissions are : [5]- transportation fuels, (14.0%). This is indubitably an anthropogenic cause of global warming. If humans were to cease to exist, which, according to recent studies, seems increasingly likely, emissions due to transportation (planes, boats, cars, etc..) would stop going into the atmosphere, making this cause anthropogenic. - agricultural byproducts (12.5%). This is a largely anthropogenic issue. Obviously if humans went extinct, plants would go on growing, but the issue here is not the growth of plants. It is fertilizer, the amount we have to water, the waste of the obscene amount of food we throw away, etc.. Therefore this cause is anthropogenic. - industrial processes (16.8%). Since this would no longer be an issue without humans, this is anthropogenic. - power stations (21.3%). Again a clearly anthropogenic cause. - residential and commercial sources (10.3%) Will cease to exist when we do.There are many more, but this is over 50%, so I don't see my listing any more as useful. 3. What kind of effect does a rise in CO2 have? You brought up that CO2, as more of it goes into the atmosphere, becomes less potent. Indeed, for every time the amount of CO2 in our atmosphere doubles, the temperature will rise the same amount, no matter how much more CO2 is going into our atmosphere. Estimates state that this rise would be 1.5 to 4.5 C [6]. The effects of this would be massive. Already, with the 1.53 F rise that is already in place, we are seeing a drastic rise in sea levels, ice melting worldwide at rates and amounts bigger than ever predicted, some of which we can never regain, less fresh water is becoming available, the only reason our crop production isn't falling is because of GMOs, etc.. [7] These effects will be much worse the more our CO2 amount rises. An estimate says that even if we limit warming to 2 C, water levels will most likely rise by several meters.</t>
<h> This is not a part of global warming, however, the water vapor has been present, and therefore, while it contributes to the warmth of the Earth, does not contribute to the rise in the Earth's temperature, which in the past 100 years, has gone up about 1.53 F.</h>

    <t>Alex, it's been a pleasure!Well done fine Sir!Thank you for the debate, I enjoyed it!I was saving Round 5 to address the the Working Class directly - however - I don't think it would be fair as Pro would be unable to respond. Honestly, we simply ran out of time to give it a good once over - and I felt addressing the environment, amorality and utility were more important first, which leads to addressing the Working Class.Alex, I will touch on the Working Class just so we can say we did - however, voters can disregard.Pro' Closing Statement Concerns:Issue of the Morality of CapitalismThe argument often used for the morality of Capitalism is Utility! However, I don't think it prudent to clearly demonstrate Capitalism as amoral - in which the system itself (Capitalism) cannot be concerned with rightness or wrongness as it is a system used by people - but then use the argument of Utility to try and argue Capitalism as moral - that would be philosophically illogical as it would be a contradiction. In Round 4 Pro 'baited' Con and invited 'his reasoning for how Capitalism is infact moral.' The motion of the debate is: Capitalism Is Immoral - NOT: Capitalism Is Moral. Con did not need to necessarily prove that Capitalism is moral. Rather, Con maintained and demonstrated the position that Capitalism (as an economic system) is amoral - thus not immoral.To which Pro concluded in his Closing Statement, 'This is true, but Con fails to do so, he introduces data and fails to provide analysis.' If it has been demonstrated that Capitalism itself as an economic system is amoral - then - the objective has been achieved as Capitalism is not automatically immoral.Issue of SourcesThis one is funny. Let's put this in perspective; Con uses at least 6 cites amp; sources in every cited round with a total 18. Pro only uses 3 or 4 in the same rounds with a total of 11 - A DIFFERENCE OF 7! - and then Pro asks the voting populace to only critic Con's cited sources.It's true, the quality of the source is important - BUT - if two cites were deducted from Con for each cited round, Con would still finish with more cites/sources of equal quality - still.Let's keep in mind cites are not just for source references when presenting a thesis but also to protect intellectual property and to prevent plagiarisms.Issue of Communist ArgumentsThere was no endorsement or argument made for/of Communism or Marxism whatsoever! Communism and Marxism was only mentioned for contrast of economic systems and to illustrate points regarding Capitalism and the environment! The contrast of economic systems was needed to show Pro that the reasons he gave for the immorality of Capitalism are also observed in 'other' economies and, thusly, simply weren't good enough reasons for his case.Working Class (voters may disregard)Capitalism lifts general populations out of poverty. So, though we can talk about Class Warfare, child-labour in the past, and social-economic injustices, in general, the greater population is served (world wide), which was demonstrated through Utility.This is why data(s) for global Gross National Incomes (GNI) and the Human Development Index (HDI) were introduced by Con.Simply put, the individual worker is part of a system which benefits the whole.CONCLUSION:Like an inanimate object - Capitalism is not 'conscious' of it's morality or not. Capitalism is an economic system - which is used by people - in which the system itself is incapable of being immoral or moral. Rather, it depends how it is used by the people using it. Hence, Capitalism as an economic system is AMORAL - and as such cannot be immoral.Con will not try to appeal or try to sway the voting populace in final remarks but simply requests that Debate.org's voting guidelines be followed.Many thanks!</t>

    <t>A well written reply. Now it has come to closing statement. I will introduce no new evidence as I feel is proper for Round 5. Con is in no way obligated to follow suit. It will be concise and name reasons for to vote Pro. Closing Statement It has been quite a debate however there are numerous reasons on which Pro has carried the day. These are outlined below:  Firstly I would like to cite the lack of Con demonstrating the morality of Capitalism. In round 2 I explained in detail that morality is determined via cost benefit analysis. I went on to use data which supports that Capitalism has a greater cost than benefit and therefore must be rendered immoral. Con never introduced a method to determining morality nor did he apply the data he found to an expressed moral system. Even if one assumes Con operates under the cost-benefit model which I articulated, he never once named it or explained how his points can be found as amoral or moral through cost-benefit analysis. Beyond that he claims that all he has to do is show that capitalism is amoral rather than immoral to win the debate. This is true, but Con fails to do so, he introduces data and fails to provide analysis. On these facts alone I believe you, the voters, ought to vote pro.  Secondly my opponent dropped my contention on exploitation of workers, while he says he would address it in later rounds he has yet to do so. Therefore in the lack of a rebuttal one ought to vote Pro as I have fielded arguments.   Thirdly there is the matter of sources, In the arguments for the resolution academics are frequently cited and reputable sources can be found in at the of my arguments in rounds 2, 3, and 4. Con on the other hand has cited wikipedia, about.com, and slideshare. Thus I urge you to vote pro as you may put more faith in the accuracy of the sources.  Fourthly and finally one ought to vote Pro on topicality. Con strayed from the resolution and forwarded arguments in regard to communism. The arguments for Pro always link back to the resolution and only target points actually made by Con. Con on the other hand constructed a few red herrings and on more than one occasion veered from the resolution. I urge all voters to read the arguments carefully and if one discovers this assertion to be true then they must vote Pro.  Thank you for the debate and thank you for voting ~Alex</t>

    <t>Alex, nice work!I like the counterpoint ideas.The discussion is shaping up!Historical Narrative:Again, the historical narrative is invaluable here for perspective -- but let's go a little further back this time and then fast-forward to Marx: In a natural state plants and animals are inherent 'consumers' -- requiring energy and resources. It is the biological and ecological - Tao - way things are. We are governed by the Laws of Thermodynamics and there is no way of escaping this. We have to consume life of some kind (plant or animal, vice-versa) to survive. We need to build shelter(s). We need to stay warm. We need to secure resources to do these things.I wish it were different. I wish the environment and the species in it were 100% safe -- and the world and every living being lived in a happy utopia -- safe from me when I need to eat or shelter my body from the elements -- but I'm sorry -- I will destroy a tree in order to build a shelter or make a fire while out foraging for some endangered species to eat so I don't starve! HA! And I'm sure you would do the same! You could decide to eat nothing but some berries maybe in the hopes of minimizing the suffering of the little creatures, but, since meat has a higher caloric-value, in a survival situation, I wouldn't be mad at ya if you did eat the little forest dwellers, which are busy consuming to survive as we are. It's the Circle of Life my friend [Lion King, Disney]. --Least I point out you are still consuming the berries and effecting the environment and rest of the ecosystem! Now, besides being somewhat off-point and silly, the reason I bring up these ideas is because even Marx recognized this. Humans are social animals who often benefit from performing these basic survival functions together -- coming up with better and more efficient ways -- requiring less energy and resources to secure more, etc. As you pointed out in your first argument, 'Capitalism is without a doubt the most productive economic system ever created.' Marx, whose orientation was largely materialist and historicist (influenced by conditions and inherent processes beyond the control of humans), framed his analysis around four central points: 1) the physical reality of people, 2) the organization of social relations, 3) the value of the historical context of development, and 4) the human nature of continuous praxis [anthropology.ua.edu/cultures/cultures] (Marx had to study history to locate an original accumulation as an external starting point of capital -- which is an interesting point I hope we will have time to get back to in later rounds).But let me ask you a series of questions for contrast and to elucidate a point further: Did communist groups throughout history ever cut down trees in excess and accumulate a resource-surplus? Did communists ever destroy environments or species to secure these resources? Do you think communists ever produced undesirable pollutants that were expelled in the environment in order to manufacture goods or products, regardless of how they held class systems or distributed and created wealth or prosperity?If the answer is YES to these questions, you might want to consider Capitalism, as a system, is equally used by people -- like other systems even though different -- capable of being misused, abandoned, and abused to excess. Your N. Korea example is to this point; as is the spousal-cheating example. We can agree to whatever, BUT if we don't stick to the original agreement then we have violated what it was we originally agreed to. You said: 'My “beef” with Capitalism is very much so rooted in the modern capitalist system, the moral repugnance of this model is grounded in the modern realities not theoretical possibilities.' So we actually agree.But, again, it's like when folks say, 'money is evil,' when someone else might disagree and point out that it depends how money is actually used. Again, the problem isn't Capitalism.The problem is how we have chosen to be capitalistic or use Capitalism. According to what you're saying, I should then judge Marxism or Communism only by the fall of the Soviet Union! Or should I still consider variations of Marxism or Communism that might still be successful?Historic Challenge Rebuttal -- provide a historical example of Capitalism devoid of “human greed, consumerism, imperialism, overpopulation, rapid industrialization, and the institutionalization of currency and money-lending. I can't speak of the greed in one's heart but here are a couple of good examples:1) 'A strong market economy was a very important aspect of Meoamerican cultures. Although much of our information about the market economy in Mesoamerica comes primarily from the Aztec/Mexica world during the Late Postclassic, there is clear evidence that markets played a major role throughout Mesoamerica in the diffusion of goods at least as recently as the Classic period. Beginning during the Classic Period (AD 250-800/900), merchants supported urban specialists with raw materials and finished goods to convert into luxury goods and exportable items for trade'. 2) 'One interesting feature of Native American money is how something which seems to have relatively little value beyond the context of Native American life and culture can in the end become quite valuable. For instance, many Indians in North America used wampum for Native American money. Wampum consists of clam shells and was initially used by coastal tribes, until the use of wampum spread throughout the continent and was store by the Iroquois, which was one of the most prosperous and powerful tribes. Although many settlers scoffed at Native American currency in the beginning, wampum was later used by many colonists as a form of currency. For instance, Peter Stuyvesant paid his workers in wampum when they constructed the New York citadel. The island of Manhattan was purchased for wampum. Wampum was used as the main form of Native American Money because it had value as a decorative item, and many Native Americans pierced holes at the top of their wampum and wore them in a belt rather than carrying wampum in a bag' [indians.org/articles/native-american-money].Green Capitalism amp; China Rebuttal:Bear in mind 'going green' is a relatively new occurrence -- even in the US! It's going to take some time. Sure, with globalization there are other countries jumping on the bandwagon, wanting to produce and manufacture goods and create wealth in the same kind of ways the US did -- unfortunately following in many of our same footsteps and making some of the same mistakes. And for them the pros might out-weight the cons financially -- though you and I would both agree not environmentally.But it's interesting to note that this week in national news: 1) John Kerry in China -- “A unique co-operative effort” with China on the issue of combating climate change' [theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/15/john-kerry-china].2) 'John Kerry Calls Climate Change a 'Weapon of Mass Destruction'. Note the most capitalistic nation's Secretary of State is visiting China and working on these issues. Again, Civilization is now reacting to a new perspective and trying to understand and find it's environmental equilibrium while maintaining it's livelihood.Philanthropy Rebuttal:Con never asserted Corporate philanthropy is 'enough' -- but will in later rounds demonstrate capitalistic societies have and do 'give' more when presenting utility and addressing the Working Class.</t>

    <t>1. Capitalism destroys the environment.Capitalism is without a doubt the most productive economic system ever created. Capitalism, throughout history, has required an ever increasing level of natural resources to sustain itself. To quote Abramsky, Fellow at the Institute of Advanced Studies in Science, Technology and Society: ' The current worldwide system of production is based on endless growth and expansion, which is simply incompatible with a long term reduction in emissions and energy consumption. Despite the fact that localized and punctual moments of reduction may well still occur, the overall energy consumption and emissions of the system as a whole can only increase[1].'Thus Capitalism is unable to break free from the status quo of industrialization and environmental pollution. In fact it has only to contribute to the crisis. So what then are the impacts of status quo 'worldwide system of production' on the environment?A. Climate change at this point has considerable evidence to support Anthropogenic involvement. Indeed one can no longer claim, with any basis in scientific fact, that climate change is a purely natural event, outside of human agency. The following chart is provided by the OSS Foundation:  The impacts of climate change on biodiversity are unparalleled by any other disaster in recorded history. A wide variety of projections have been made by experts on the topic: The Nature Conservancy claims as much as 1/4 of ALL species on earth are at risk for extinction[2]. Depending on the projection used these figures range as high as 80/70% and as low as gt;10%. Regardless of the model used, I challenge Con and the voters to find a model supported by mainstream science that which concludes biodiversity is affected by climate change.B. further evidence of the negative impact of the industrialized capitalist era can be found in deforestation trends. E.O. Wilson, Harvard sociobiologist, in The Future of life posits that a sharp increase in Global deforestation occurred around 1852(during the industrialization of Capitalist Europe and America in the 1800's). By his estimates, 80% of All old growth forests will be wiped out. This is without a doubt human agency and the data supports that the capitalist system has deeply worsened this trend. I doubt severely that tribal collectivists and other groups outside of the capitalist system were responsible for this sharp change. Here is a chart that shows US old growth forests from the 'Atlas of the Historical Geography of the United States':  Unless Con wishes to contest that this was indeed not the result of Capitalism in America, but rather natural phenomena or the actions of tribal Native Americans then we must conclude that rapid global deforestation is the result of the Capitalist system.Why the destruction of the environment is a moral matter is simple. In fact it can be rendered morally repugnant in numerous models of morality, I will outline 2.~Species rights: Genocide, the intentional wiping out of ethnic groups is outlawed by international law and near universally condemned. What then gives the right, nor the ethical reasoning to intentionally exploit and wipe out the rest of the animal kingdom? This is totally unacceptable. Does one not treat ethically their pets? Yet on what grounds can we advocate for the intentional genocide on thousands of species. The degree to which Capitalism has exploited and wiped out plants/animals indicates a system of true moral repugnance.~'Stewards of Creation' To those voters who posses morality based on the Abrahamic religions and believe in a god given superiority of animals, I would like to point out that nature is creation. Therefor the destruction of the natural world for profit, is the very apex of Man's arrogance to God. Thus you must vote in accord with Capitalism as an immoral economic system.2. Capitalism exploits WorkersExploitation: The action or fact of treating someone unfairly in order to benefit from their work.All born into this world are free, yet most of us grew up in chains, as the Jacobin once posited.All property(with few exceptions) is owned by either a nation state or private individual in the Capitalist system. Meaning that all resources are owned, as well as the means in which to produce them. Those who have private control over the means of production, are in a naturally exploitative relationship over those who lack it. Consider I played the capitalist game right and now I - along with others like me- own the vast majority of the wealth(capital) and property. Now Con is born into this world, he graduates high school and is now a member of the working class. Now he gets to enter the world of the voluntary free market! He really has two choices: work for a private corporation -like mine- or be without the ability to produce(mooch, vagabond, starvation). If all the property is owned and all the resources within them, and additionally the means to produce material goods(factories, farms, bakeries, etc) then how may Con opt out?He really cannot, this is where the exploitation really begins. But lets zoom out, as those of us in WEIRD (Western Educated Industrialized Rich Democratic) nations do not do much of the producing. Therefor the conditions of labor in which he is subjected to, which are still exploitative is nothing near what the capitalist system does to labor involved in production. CIA World Factbook 2006 via Stephen Morley Green=Industry Blue=Service. I want to point out that all nation states with the exception of Laos, Cuba and arguably North Korea operate within the confines of a capitalist market economy.Let us consider the following thought experiment, based on the 'Original Position' of Oxford Fellow John Rawls. The purpose of this thought experiment is to determine what in a society is just and what is unjust:We have been tasked with determining a new society for humanity to live in and then we shall be born into this new world. But there is a catch: You will not get to choose your gender, economic standing, ethnicity or kin. You may be anyone.You would naturally want, at least for yourself, guarantee of adequate living conditions and the access to earn a living wage. If one posits that they would like to be born into a society with the two aforementioned attributes then Capitalism is most definitely the system you do not wish to pursue.To quote Professor James Davies 'Income inequality has been rising for the past 20 to 25 years and we think that is true for inequality in the distribution of wealth.[3]'Additionally the same article yields:' the richest 1 percent of adults - most of whom live in Europe or the United States - owned 40 percent of global assets.'Meaning that the world capitalist system is one of massive, and polarizing inequity.To frame this another way, under the social contract of Capitalism, you may be born into a family-not to mention region- with little capital and thus forced to labor and produce for society. Others in this socio-economic system inherit the means of production and a far greater level of capital. They can and will profit of your labor.J. Greene of Harvard found in a study that human beings make moral choices via cost-benefit analysis[4].Capitalism bears billions into this world with minute capital and the few profit off these impoverished masses.The benefit off the few are outweighed by the suffering of the many.Capitalism is immoral.Now I shall turn it over to Con, I await his opening statement with anticipation.~Alex1.

    <t>Well said! I like the ideas and the graphics! Nice work!  The reason I accepted this debate is precisely because there is a hidden premise lurking here -- and you have presented it in your arguments in grandiose fashion! I think this should be a great discussion!  The hidden premise you have put forward is this: Capitalism itself is inherently immoral -- or, at the very least, is an economic system which automatically leads to the inevitable consequences of 1) destroying the environment and 2) mistreating a working class -- which is simply not true. It is false.  The historical narrative is invaluable here for perspective. For example, in his Two Treatises of Government, John Locke (considered to be one of the founding architects of modern Capitalism) outlined 'rules' for being capitalistic, specifically 'limits to accumulation'. Also important was the concept of securing and setting value and how property should be defined.  Locke rightly recognized that the human element of greed could transform Capitalism into an economic system which could be abused or misused to extreme excess. A 'check and balance' set of ideas was put forward. Locke is very clear that even in a natural state of plenty:  1) There must be enough for others 2) One can use natural resources as long as it isn't stolen or taken from others 3) Natural resources can be used as long as what is taken, is replaced and doesn't spoil [Second Treatise, Sec. 85]  Do we follow guidelines like these today? No, absolutely not. There is a strident difference between John Locke's fundamental 'rules' for being capitalistic -- producing goods and creating property and wealth -- compared to what is currently practiced in the US and abroad, what we know as Capitalism today.  But then the conversation changes very quickly. We can then ask if there are different ways of being economically capitalistic? And indeed there are. Does human greed, consumerism, imperialism, overpopulation, rapid industrialization, and the institutionalization of currency and money-lending effect our brand of Capitalism and how we have chosen to be economic? And the answer is unquestionably and emphatically YES!  So the problem isn't Capitalism. Capitalism itself as a system can be broken down to a few basic components that are not automatically immoral when combined. The problem is how we have chosen to be capitalistic or use Capitalism -- combine that with many other factors like gross-excess consumerism and overpopulation, etc., and you get what we have today.  Your idealistic 'beef' with Capitalism is a good one. But I recon its like saying, 'money is evil,' when others might say that it depends how money is used. Your putting blame in the wrong place. This has nothing to do with semantics but is very much a categorization mistake -- and I want to make that clear before we go further.  Having said that, I'm not sure how useful it is to talk about the eradication of peoples, species or environments only due to Capitalism -- because there are different factors of colonization and imperialistic practices to consider -- and what you have casually done is inadvertently 'fuse' these other factors to Capitalism -- or likened them to each other, or basically suggested 'this-from-that.'  Capitalism is not a very good reason to suggest as an explanation as to why some cultures may conquer others. It's way more complicated than that. Dr. Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs and Steel is probably the best working thesis to explain why a culture may conquer another culture. In fact, it has nothing to do with Capitalism.  'Only people have responsibilities' -- Milton Friedman  Your idea of Capitalism I believe has been stigmatized by the mess the Baby-boomer-generation created -- who are responsible for the 'consume-to-excess' brand of capitalistic practices in modern times. 'He who dies with the most toys wins' type of consumer attitudes are no longer acceptable and are changing [The Success of Capitalism, documentary].  What if I told you there are capitalists who are also minimalist? Or Communist-capitalist? Or Socialist-capitalist? Hippie-capitalist? The ideas and practice of Capitalism are changing:  There are what are known as 'B' Corporations (Benefit Corps.). 'Benefit corporations differ from traditional corporations in regards to their purpose, accountability and transparency. The purpose of a benefit corporation is to create general public benefit, which is defined as a material positive impact on society and the environment. A benefit corporation's directors operate the business with the same authority as in a traditional corporation, but where in a traditional corporation shareholders with proper standing judge the company's financial performance, here they judge qualitative performance based on the benefit corporation's stated goals to the community and environment' [wiki-benefit corps].  Companies have decided to 'go green' because they recognize it's beneficial to the environment and doing so is actually good for business and Capitalism long-term now. Consumers are speaking up and demanding more 'green' products and only supporting green companies, boycotting others.  'In 2010, the number of American businesses with formal 'green' programs in place increased 54 percent over the previous year according to new research from Buck Consultants (a subsidiary of Xerox). Of about 120 businesses surveyed 'including hardware and other technology firms, government offices, consultancies, non-profits, hospitals, and the makers of consumer packaged goods' 69 percent said they took deliberate measures to improve their environmental and social impact'.  Companies that put these environmental programs and projects in place lead off with these achievements in their quarterly and annual reports!  The EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) was established in 1970, during the height of American industrialism, precisely because we started to recognize gross-excess use of resources and the effects on the environment, which prior to this we didn't quite understand, say, Co2 emissions, or what acid rain was.  History starts to reflect this very soon after:  The CCAA (Comprehensive Clean Air Act) passes in 1970. Earth Day started in March of 1970. Clean Water Act passes in 1971. DDT get banned in 1972. Endangered Species Act passes in 1972. The Catalytic Converter in 1973. Unleaded gas is made widely available in 1973. United States banned the use of CFCs such as Freon in aerosol cans in 1978. Production of CFCs was almost completely phased out by 1994.  Civilization is now reacting to a new perspective and trying to understand and find it's environmental equilibrium while maintaining it's livelihood.

    <t>Thanks for the thoughtful rebuttal, I shall reply point to pointHistorical NarrativeFirstly, the following points are indeed true:All living things consume.Consumption effects nature.We must consume to survive.There is no reason to conclude however that this makes Capitalism moral.I will remind the voters that Capitalism is not an universal to all of history and is not the defacto system of life. Civilization itself is only several thousand years old,[1] and 'Hunting and gathering was humanity's first and most successful adaptation, occupying at least 90 percent of human history'[2]. This indeed involved our specsis relying off nature and thus altering nature. In this 90% of human history there were no trans-national corportions, anthropogenic climate change, rapid deforestation, nor tozxicization of the air. Capitalism is not inherant in the humanity nor are in it's abhorent results. One cannot render Capitalism as moral even it occupied 99% of human history, simply because a model is popular does not make it anyless morally repugnant. Fortunetly Capitalism has not even done that.Marx and CommunismMarxian thought is introduced by my opponent and he goes on to pose the following questions to me:'Did communist groups throughout history ever cut down trees in excess and accumulate a resource-surplus? Did communists ever destroy environments or species to secure these resources? Do you think communists ever produced undesirable pollutants that were expelled in the environment in order to manufacture goods or products, regardless of how they held class systems or distributed and created wealth or prosperity?'While I may infact be a Socialist these questions are wholly untopical. The resolution is capitalism immoral rather then: Communism is more moral Capitalism. I have no obligation in this debate to provide an alternative economic system with a higher rate of morality. Yes to the final question though, judge Communism of it's historical accomplishments, not theoretical framework. Before I adress the rest, lets all refresh ourselves on the definition for Capitalism to be used for this debate: 'Economic system in which most of the means of production are privately owned, and production is guided and income distributed largely through the operation of markets.'This debate is meant to demonstrate to the voters the morality of the system in question. The consequent ideology in which it is founded upon or invisioned to operate under are as detacted from reality as the Jihadist's phantasm. Thus the voters ought not to base their decision in this realm of discourse but rather the very real cost and benefits. As I pointed out in Round 2, moral decisions are based in cost-benefit analysis, how may test that which does not exist? Yet alone make moral decisions.Capitalism With a Human Face1. To provide a counter I shall qoute Craig Hanson, a Meso-American Archeologist whom has authored over twenty papers on the region: 'it is possible to hypothesize apre-capitalistworld-system' (Schneider 1977:25) in which core areas accumulated precious materialswhile exporting manufactures and peripheral areas exported materials against an inflow of finishedgoods. Thispre-capitalistworld-system created the relationships that, uponEuropeancolonization, evolved into a facet of historical capitalism in Mesoamerica[3].' Hanson here is arguing for the existence of a pre-capitalist 'world system', his prime example of a pre-capitalist society is Meso-America. Meso-American society only evolved into 'historical capitalism' after European colonization, contray to the about.com article. The full paper will be linked in cited sources.2. This article does posit that currency existed in some Pre-Columbian tribes. This article does not posit the existence of Capitalism in America amongst indigeonus tribes.Thus I will affirm to the voters that both examples are insufficent to provide a historical example of Capitalism that is devoid of “human greed, consumerism, imperialism, overpopulation, rapid industrialization, and the institutionalization of currency and money-lending.” The reason I make this affirmation is due to the fact that neither are actual examples of Capitalism.China, The Enviorment, and Philanthropy'the most capitalistic nation's Secretary of State is visiting China and working on these issues. Again, Civilization is now reacting to a new perspective and trying to understand and find it's environmental equilibrium while maintaining it's livelihood.'Both nations are talking and manuevering on the issue of climate change, but the articles do not put forth evidence that Civilization is finding an equilibriam between enviormental conservation and prosperity. This was already addressed in my qoute from Abramsky from round one which i shall reiterate:'The current worldwide system of production is based on endless growth and expansion, which is simply incompatible with a long term reduction in emissions and energy consumption. Despite the fact that localized and punctual moments of reduction may well still occur, the overall energy consumption and emissions of the system as a whole can only increase.'Regardless of the current postering that the two powerful nation states are undertaking, the world system of  capitalism is unable to stop the energy consumption at the heart of the crisis. Capitalism is, as we speak, still on the present trajectory of enviormental annihiltion. I  anticipate Con's rebuttal to the 'Expliotation of Workers' in the next round and consequenstly his reasoning for how Capitalism is infact moral. I now turn it over to Con without ant further ado.</t>
<h> Thus I will affirm to the voters that both examples are insufficent to provide a historical example of Capitalism that is devoid of “human greed, consumerism, imperialism, overpopulation, rapid industrialization, and the institutionalization of currency and money-lending.” </h>

    <t>Thank you for the thoughtful reply Philosurfer. I like the lay out and how concise you kept it.  I shall reply in the same manner, for the sake of both the voters and the impending windstorm. I shall reply to three arguments my opponent has set forth in the order he arranged them:  1. Capitalism is not inherently bad 2. Green Capitalism 3. Philanthropy  Capitalism is not inherently bad Con quotes Locke, an enlightenment philosopher who would indeed-as con pointed out- influence the birth of capitalist liberal democracy. Locke though lived under feudalism and was drawing up the theoretical scaffolding for a future society. Locke’s ideal “rules”, which Con posits Capitalism today shows strident differences. But Con is right to affirm the principles that Locke outlined in the quoted passage. However the results of Capitalism are the black knight to white bishop when we compare them with Locke’s notions.  Lets put this in perspective with another political thinker’s theoretical scaffolding and the society we find today, North Korea.  The ideology of North Korea is Juche. The idea was borne in the mind of Kim Il Sung, and    the Korean State website puts it as follows:  “The Juche idea is based on the philosophical principle that man is the master of everything and decides everything. It is the man-centred world outlook and also a political philosophy to materialize the independence of the popular masses, namely, a philosophy which elucidates the theoretical basis of politics that leads the development of society along the right path.[1]”    There is nothing fundamentally immoral with this statement, the immorality of the North Korean system is presently clearly in the actions of the state: leadership of the party has passed one generation to the next, over 200,000 in prison camps, an UN report of disturbing human rights violations[2]. My point is that the morality of system cannot be judged on the ideals of it’s founders.   Secondly I challenge Con to provide a historical example of Capitalism devoid of “human greed, consumerism, imperialism, overpopulation, rapid industrialization, and the institutionalization of currency and money-lending.” My “beef” with Capitalism is very much so rooted in the modern capitalist system, the moral repugnance of this model is grounded in the modern realities not theoretical possibilities.   I can claim to my girlfriend that I will not cheat on her and that will be the foundation of our relationship. If we both proceed to do cheat, then can our relationship be judged  as one of moral strength? Of course not, nor can we judge the moral strength of Capitalism based on the writings of it’s founders.  Green Capitalism   To quote MIT lecturer Frank Ackerman: 'The apparent progress on emission reductions in rich countries has occurred at a time of widespread outsourcing of manufacturing to China and other developing countries. In the process, we have effectively outsourced our carbon emissions as well. If consumers are responsible for the emissions from making the consumer goods they buy, then we have not solved the problem.[3]'  The EPA has made these steps to appease the public. They inability to stop the destructive forces of our modern system is staggering. There is another event you ought to add to your timetable: trade with China. China is now the great industrial producer and soon to be the world’s largest economy. In Beijing the air so bad that even a Chinese Government report found the capital “barely suitable” for human life[4]. May I remind the voters that Capitalism is is a system of blatant inequity. Those responsible for producing commodities necessary to our society live in incredible suffering.     Philanthropy If Corporate philanthropy was enough then why does the previously cited global inequity deepen? It is true that is all of those with massive accumulation of capital spent it on humanitarian efforts for the poor that our present crisis would be far softened, possibly even solved. This most certainly is not the case, unless Con can introduce data that supports the contrary.  I will now turn it over to Con.</t>
<h>    Secondly I challenge Con to provide a historical example of Capitalism devoid of “human greed, consumerism, imperialism, overpopulation, rapid industrialization, and the institutionalization of currency and money-lending.”</h>

    <t>EVIDENCE ANALYSIS: Pro Cites a Wiki and an Activist Website...  Round 3-Paragraph 2 amp; 3: Beachapedia.org  In rd. 3 paragraph 2- 3, PRO’s only “evidence” to support all of his assertions is a wiki known as beachapedia. A wiki in which any anonymous blogger can post her/his opinion is NOT a reliable source. Prefer CON’s more reliable evidence from professional sources like the Bloomberg Business report, Reuters, and the International Energy Agency.  Rd.3-Paragraph 4: Environmental Defense Center  In rd. 3 paragraph 4, PRO’s can only cite an activist website. This is problematic. Its political ideology will always be one-sided, and have a preconceived conclusion before researching the issue. According to a study on environmentalist organizations, they would often spread misinformation intentionally because they believed that no one would take action unless the public believed the situation was more dire than it really was (3-i). Prefer a balanced approach that accepts the complexity of the topic at hand. Prefer CON’s professional sources like Reuters, which strives for balance and objectivity.       (3-i) PROF. SOBER, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, 1986 (Princeton University Press). Paragraph 5-6: ZERO EVIDENCE  In paragraph 5-6, PRO makes a series of claims that are utterly unsupported, such as fracking causing an “economic loss” in particular regions. Yet he provides ZERO evidence to support this. Clearly, you should prefer evidence-backed arguments over unsupported claims.     Evidence Analysis Voting Issues: I have demonstrated that CON has cited the most reliable sources. PRO either cites evidence that is not applicable to the topic at hand (as I demonstrated in round-2), or websites with zero credibility (as I have demonstrated above in this response). Since Pro’s only make baseless claims, you should disregard them due to their lack of evidence. Given that PRO’s baseless claims must be disregarded, due to their lack of credible evidence, all of CON’s arguments stand unchallenged; thus you must  vote CON.   But just in case I haven’t fully persuaded you, dear reader, I will refute all of PRO’s arguments   one by one.   I - HARMS FROM OFFSHORE FRACKING ARE FAR LESS LIKELY amp; NEGLIGIBLE ONCE REGULATIONS [VIA CON’S COUNTER-PLAN] ARE ENFORCED  A. Once an industry is regulated, accidents often decrease to a negligible probability of less than 1% . According to a study by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, new regulations of the trucking industry led to far less accidents and quote, “an estimated $280 million in savings from fewer large truck crashes and $470 million in savings from improved driver health” (3-ii).  (3-ii) US Dept. of Transportation 2004. B. There are zero significant accidents once industries are properly regulated. Offshore drilling for natural gas off the coasts of the UK, Norway, Denmark, Ireland, and other countries that drill in the North Sea have higher regulations and virtually no accidents. According to a study conducted by the United Kingdom’s North Sea Authorities Forum, in which hundreds of offshore drill sites in the north sea were audited for best practices, most drill sites followed the current regulations to avoid penalties and steep fines (3-iii).   (3-iii) North Sea Authorities Forum, UK 2013. C. A study by the EPA found that once regulations are enacted the chance of a leak is less than 0.001% for most industries (3-iv).  (3-iv) EPA, 2006.  Pro asserted that leaks will happen whether or not there are regulations. My evidence demonstrates that regulations, like the ones espoused in CON’s counter-plan, do work and will reduce the risk of accidents to a negligible probability. We will be paralyzed if we ban any action that has a small (less than 1%) risk associated with it. You have a higher chance of being killed in a car accident then there being a offshore fracking leak. Should you refuse to get into a car ever again because of a tiny risk of an accident? You could, but the definite harms of a car-free lifestyle for most people outweigh the possible benefits. Likewise, if we ban all offshore fracking then thousands of shale-gas employees will definitely lose their jobs, energy prices will definitely rise, and the US economy will definitely be weaker.The environment might be better off, but the environment would have probably been fine either way. Prefer a world in which we have a realistic understanding of risk so we can act to make the world better rather than be paralyzed by fear.     II. COUNTER PLAN EXTENSION   Detecting Problem Areas to Prevent Leaks   1. New regulation - mandate the best leak proof equipment  2. New regulation - mandate frequent random checks via submerged vehicles or by underwater cameras and scanners.  NO DUMPING: RECYCLE ALL PROCESSED WATER  3. New regulation - BAN all ocean dumping and demand that all frackers follow regulations spelled out in my round 2 response, especially fracking with recycled processed water.   COMMIT THE CRIME, PAY THE MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR FINE, AND MAYBE FACE JAIL TIME  4. New Regulation: Provide companies BIG incentives to follow all the regulations by spelling out consequences of multi-billion dollar fines and criminal charges.   By implementing my counter-plan I eliminate any plausible risk of leaks, and thereby eliminate any harms to local coastal economies that a leak might cause. CON’s counter-plan preserves the enormous economic benefits of offshore fracking, and prevents any environmental harm. Following pro’s plan would cost the US millions of jobs and not make the environment any safer. Thus, you must VOTE CON.     III. COUNTER-PLAN, JOB GROWTH EXTENSION:  A.  NEW REGULATIONS CREATE JOBS   These new regulations will create demand  for new services thereby creating jobs (3-v).  (3-v) Bloomberg Business, 2012.  B. ELIMINATE ALL ENERGY SUBSIDIES AND INCREASE TAXES ON SHALE GAS PRODUCTION, TO BENEFIT PUBLIC EDUCATION (3-vi)  POLITICO, 2012. THE ATLANTIC, 2013.  C. PRO CONCEDED THAT  OFFSHORE amp; ON-LAND FRACKING SUPPORTS OVER 1.7 MILLION JOBS: Extend all of my arguments on the economic benefits of fracking. Pro did not challenge any of them. Pro’s only comment was how leaks could hurt local coastal economies but he did not provide any evidence for this claim and the counter-plan would prevent any such leaks from occurring.       IV. COAL IS WORSE  This argument was made in round-2 and dropped by Pro. If fracking offshore/onshore is banned, then there will be greater environmental damage because it will increase the use of coal.      V. LIVING LIKE NATIVE AMERICANS WON’T WORK  A. Pro’s contention that we can erase our dependence for fuel by living like the Native Americans is pure fantasy. Present-day Native Americans do not even live like this-most of them live modern lives. We should create smart policies that actually respond to they way people will behave in the real world, not the way we want them to behave in an idealized society.   B. Living like Native Americans in a pre-industrialized society would be “nasty brutish and short.”     (3-vii)   SOURCES:   The Origins of Native Americans, Crawford, 1998.  Debating Roman Demography, Scheidel, 2001. C. ECONOMIC HEALTH REAPS BENEFITS FOR GENERATIONS  Economic health, and the benefits of a good job from a natural gas producer are not “short-term” as my opponent suggests. These economic benefits have long term impacts in building a real middle class for the foreseeable future. </t>

    <t>@joza, thank you for setting up this debate. May the best argumentation win! Cheers!  Fracking should NOT be entirely banned within the sovereign territory (including bodies of water) of the United States. Rather, it should remain legal under tighter restrictions. I will provide an interpretation of the resolution, outline the current immense benefits of fracking, and then explain how all of pro's concerns can be addressed through stronger regulations.   Interpretation of Resolution: Pro believes that all off-shore fracking should be banned. Off-shore fracking is fracking conducted on platforms a few miles out to sea. However, the only evidence he cited in his round 2 response referred only to fracking done on land. His main concern is that fracking requires too much fresh water. However, off-shore fracking only uses salt water found in the ocean. So off-shore fracking has zero impact on fresh water supplies. You should vote CON on that alone since pro's main contention is not applicable to the resolution at hand, off-shore fracking NOT on-land fracking. However, in the spirit of the resolution's intent, I will argue in favor of keeping both off-shore and on-land fracking legal under tighter restrictions.   1. Benefits of Fracking / Natural Gas A. Fracked Natural Gas is Cleaner than Other Carbon Based Fuels Pro is concerned about the environment, but banning fracking will cause greater harm to the environment by forcing more people to use coal instead of natural gas. Fracking in the US produces over 60 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day. The US has become the world's greatest producer of natural gas. Natural gas supplies 24% of energy used in the United States, and emits far less CO2 gases than coal and oil (i). According to the 2008 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, coal and oil release twice as much CO2 as natural gas into the atmosphere. If fracking was banned, there would not be enough energy produced to meet demand, thereby forcing cities to use pollution heavy coal plants for their energy needs. Can't we just use solar power instead? The technology is not yet efficient enough to meet our energy needs. According to Christine Whitman, former governor of New Jersey and former head of the EPA, solar and wind power technology is not yet efficient enough to replace even a fraction of the energy supply currently served by carbon-based sources (ii). We should continue to pursue renewable forms of energy, but we need not turn out the lights on the economy by imposing draconian measures on essential natural gas production. (i) USA TODAY 2013.  (ii) Wall Street Journal 2013.   B. Jobs Fracking currently supports over 1.7 million jobs (iii). If you banned fracking you would put all of those people back into the unemployment line. In places like South Dakota, where fracking is most prevalent, the unemployment rate is around 3%, far below the national average of 7% (iv).  (iii) Bloomberg Business 2012.  C. Energy Economy Fracked natural gas has become an essential part of the US economy. As the world's leading producer of natural gas the US exports over 1,500,000 million cubic feet of natural gas a year. This brings billions of dollars into the US economy every year (v).  (v) US Energy Information Admin. 2012. 2. Ecological Concerns Pro is concerned that fracking may harm American fresh water and the quality of our air. We both want our water to be clean and our air to be safe. But banning fracking is not a practical way to do that. There are policies we can put into place that can preserve the tremendous economic benefits of fracking while conserving precious natural resources like clean air and fresh water.   3. CON's COUNTER-PLAN: Enact New Regulations on Fracking New Regulation I: Only Use Recycled Processed Water Over and Over Again Both off-shore and on-land fracking require a great deal of processed water in order to release natural gas from the ground. However, neither method requires fresh water. Off-shore fracking uses oceanic salt water, and many on-land producers use processed water over and over again (vi). New Regulation II: All Frackers Must Be in Full Compliance with the CLEAN AIR ACT and the CLEAN WATER ACT During the Bush administration, some of Cheney's associates passed a bill known as the 'Haliburton Act' in which several energy companies became exempt from the CLEAN AIR ACT, and CLEAN WATER ACT. This meant that fracking companies were not required to disclose the chemicals used in fracking. All of these companies should comply with EPA requests and disclose all ingredients used in fracking. This way every ingredient can be studied, and companies will be encouraged to develop the safest fracking recipe possible.  New Regulation III: Enclose Each Fracking Site Within Enclosed Facilities to Capture All Fumes and Chemicals from Escaping into the Environment Every natural gas site should be fully enclosed in order to contain any chemicals or fumes that might escape into the local environment. This will keep everyone safer, and serve as a way to capture an additional source of fuel.  Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is emitted in the oil and gas sector, at coal mines, landfills and manure management facilities. These emissions represent an often profitable solution to global climate change: methane can be recovered and used to produce electricity and heat. However, while there are hundreds of methane mitigation projects successfully operating around the world, much more can be done, if the right policies are in place.  New Regulation IV: All Fracking Sites May Only Target Natural Gas Shales that are a Safe Distance Away from Sources of Fresh Drinking Water This one speaks for itself.  VOTING ISSUES A. Interpretation: Even though the resolution wants to ban off-shore fracking, PRO only discussed on-shore fracking. You ought to vote CON since PRO has only provided evidence about the amount of fresh water used via on-land fracking. However, off-shore fracking uses salt-water so it's not applicable to PRO's only attack on fracking. However, if we want to interpret the intent of the resolution to be about all forms of fracking, then you still should vote CON because I explained how processed water can be recycled by frackers rather than use more fresh water.  B. Counter-Plan/New Regulations: Con has provided an alternative course of action that solves for all of Pro's ecological concerns while preserving the huge economic benefits of fracking. Therefore, you must vote CON.</t>

    <t>I stand corrected, although I did provide information behind the reason for fracking to be banned onshore (consider it an extension, showing problems which arise from onshore fracking also), there are still unjustifiable environmental implications which arise from offshore hydraulic fracturing. The environmental implications are as follows:   On offshore sites, leakage of pipes could go on for long periods of time without detection and be widely dispersed by tides and currents. The Sockeye oil field is nearby to Channel Island Marine Protected Areas and a spill or long-term leak could do major injury to the ecosystem. The South Ellwood oil field is close to the coast and could contaminate the Santa Barbara beaches for some time without detection. The area near the Ellwood fields is known for having large natural fractures in the ocean floor. Any fracking fluids injected into wells offshore could travel through natural fractures already in the rocks into the ocean waters. Approximately half the oil platforms in federal waters in the Santa Barbara Channel discharge all or a portion of their wastewater directly to the ocean, according to a California Coastal Commission document. This produced wastewater contains all of the chemicals injected originally into the fracked wells, with the addition of toxins gathered from the subsurface environment. Oil saturated the Santa Barbara Channel and washed ashore before the well at Platform A was capped - yet even after the well was capped, oil continued to seep up steadily through fractures in the ocean floor for several years. In the end, over three million gallons of water were released, fouling 35 miles of coastline, killing as many as 15,000 seabirds and poisoning dolphins, seals and sea lions. Santa Barbara's tourist-dependent local economy, business and property owners, and the local fishing industry all suffered extensive ECONOMIC loss in the wake of the spill. This information provides the environmental implications caused by offshore hydraulic fracturing. Regardless of a short-term economic gain, a tremendous long-term environmental loss will be the resultant of continous offshore hydraulic fracturing. It is of moral obligation that our environment is protected by banning such practises. What is the real necessity of a strong economy when the environment, something for our future generations to relish, is at an undeniable risk? The ends do not justify the means. Native Americans once occupied the lands with decent lives in harmony with local environment without having paramount dependancy on 'jobs' within the energy sector - why must we be different? It must also be mentioned that, in the last source aforementioned, local economic loss was extensive in the areas local to the spill which was at cause of offshore hydraulic fracturing. No matter what the case, it is inevitable that mistakes are to be made, regulation or not. CON has asserted their argument in economic gains of hydraulic fracturing, however both the economy and environment proves to both be affected in multiple ways as consequence of inexorable error with fracking. Therefore, CON's justification of fracking through economic gains is innacurate.</t>

    <t>Firstly I would like to say thankyou to my Contender, Hierocles. May this debate be constructive and educational. Offshore Hydraulic Fracturing (Fracking), should, in my opinion, be banned completely due to the implications in which it is certain to leave behind. Simply stated, the ends do not justify the means. In 2010, it was estimated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that 70 to 140 billion gallons of water was used to fracture 35,000 wells in the United States each year. This is the average annual water consumption of 40 to 80 cities each with a population of 50,000. The extraction of so much water for fracking has understandably raised concerns in relation to depletion of fresh water zones which may also be required for human consumption. In accordance with these figures, it must be noted that it requires an average of 200 truck trips per 1 million gallons of water, this means that in 2010 there was roughly 14,000 truck trips at the lowest for the process of fracking alone. With all this being said, air quality will be immensely affected if fracking is not banned.</t>

    <t>I thank my opponent for accepting my debate.Pros CasePoint A: Man-Made Global Warming existsSub point 1: Scientific consensus'Carbon dioxide and other global warming pollutants are collecting in the atmosphere like a thickening blanket, trapping the sun's heat and causing the planet to warm up. Although local temperatures fluctuate naturally, over the past 50 years the average global temperature has increased at the fastest rate in recorded history. Scientists say that unless we curb the emissions that cause climate change, average U.S. temperatures could be 3 to 9 degrees higher by the end of the century.' Scientists are undoubtedly sure that Man-Made Global warming is indeed a real threat. As is corroborated by a collection of scholarly articles. 97% of climate scientists are in agreement.(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)Point B: man-made global warming is the primary cause of Global WarmingSub point 1: Scientific Consensus'The United States Global Change Research Program (which includes the Department of Defense, NASA, National Science Foundation and other government agencies) has said that 'global warming is unequivocal and primarily human-induced' and that 'climate changes are underway in the United States and are projected to grow.''(3)'The climate change denial machine has been working hard to discredit the latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, which confirms that climate change is occurring and that human activity is primarily responsible.'(5)'Ninety-seven percent of climate scientists agree that climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities,and most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position.'(6)Again this is a case of overwhelming scientific consensus. Scientific research has been done by a countless number of experts, and they have all come to a similar agreement. Humanity is the primary cause of global warming. To challenge this claim is to challenge the authority of research giants such as NASA. Environmental scientists are the authority on this subject, and they agree with the Pro.Sub point 2: Carbon Emissions are a major cause, and a product of humanity'The only way to explain the pattern [global warming] is to include the effect of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted by humans.'(2)'Most climate scientists agree the main cause of the current global warming trend is human expansion of the 'greenhouse effect' -- warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth toward space. Certain gases in the atmosphere block heat from escaping. Long-lived gases, remaining semi-permanently in the atmosphere, which do not respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are described as 'forcing' climate change'(7)Scientists agree that humanity has altered the balance of greenhouse gases on the earth, which is a direct major cause of global warming.Point C: The effects of global warming are extreme.Global climate change leads to:-Increased temperatures-Changing landscapes-A higher number of droughts, fires, and floods-Endangered wildlife habitats-Rising sea levels-Greater damage from extreme storms-More heat-related illness and disease-Economic problems(4)Sub point 1: man-made global warming encourages natural disaster'Hurricanes and other storms are likely to become stronger.'(2)'Anthropogenic warming by the end of the 21st century will likely cause hurricanes globally to be more intense on average (by 2 to 11% according to model projections for an IPCC A1B scenario). This change would imply an even larger percentage increase in the destructive potential per storm, assuming no reduction in storm size.'(8)With storms like sandy become more common and much stronger, Humans living in coastal regions face a very serious threat. Already hurricanes such as sandy and the recent Typhoon in the Philippines are costing billions of dollars in damages, and thousands of human lives. (9)(10)Man-made global warming is likely to cause these storms to become even more intense, therefore threatening to cost even more lives and money. These death counts and damage costs are not small, by any stretch of the imagination; with global warming left unchecked, these counts will grow.Sub point 2: Rising sea levels/flooding'Sea levels are expected to rise between 7 and 23 inches (18 and 59 centimeters) by the end of the century, and continued melting at the poles could add between 4 and 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters).'(2)'Floods and droughts will become more common. Rainfall in Ethiopia, where droughts are already common, could decline by 10 percent over the next 50 years.'(2)As polar caps warm, ice caps are likely to melt and release water into the oceans and seas, causing the levels to rise. this could result in flooding in coastal cities, such as New Orleans, that are close to, at, or below sea level.Furthermore, man-made global warming could result in more intense cycles of flooding and drought in other areas of the world, such as Ethiopia. These are real threats to human lives. Flooding, like storms, has a very high cost of both money and, more importantly, human life. Sub point 3: Future effects of man-made global warming could significantly increase the hostility of the Earth environment.There are a myriad of effects that man-made global warming will have that will make the Earth environment, generally, more hostile. 'Some diseases will spread, such as malaria carried by mosquitoes.' (2)'Less fresh water will be available. If the Quelccaya ice cap in Peru continues to melt at its current rate, it will be gone by 2100, leaving thousands of people who rely on it for drinking water and electricity without a source of either.' (2)'Below are some of the regional impacts of global change forecast by the IPCC:-North America: Decreasing snowpack in the western mountains; 5-20 percent increase in yields of rain-fed agriculture in some regions; increased frequency, intensity and duration of heat waves in cities that currently experience them.-Latin America: Gradual replacement of tropical forest by savannah in eastern Amazonia; risk of significant biodiversity loss through species extinction in many tropical areas; significant changes in water availability for human consumption, agriculture and energy generation.-Europe: Increased risk of inland flash floods; more frequent coastal flooding and increased erosion from storms and sea level rise; glacial retreat in mountainous areas; reduced snow cover and winter tourism; extensive species losses; reductions of crop productivity in southern Europe.-Africa: By 2020, between 75 and 250 million people are projected to be exposed to increased water stress; yields from rain-fed agriculture could be reduced by up to 50 percent in some regions by 2020; agricultural production, including access to food, may be severely compromised.-Asia: Freshwater availability projected to decrease in Central, South, East and Southeast Asia by the 2050s; coastal areas will be at risk due to increased flooding; death rate from disease associated with floods and droughts expected to rise in some regions.'(11)Here are some charts to illustrate further effects. (11)Current EffectsFuture EffectsHuman lives are at stake, and even the economies of the world are at stake.SummaryThere is overwhelming evidence to prove that man-made global warming is indeed real. Furthermore, the effects of man-made global warming are so massively detrimental that those who are concerned over the future of humanity ought to care greatly about the massive loss of life, cost of damage, and other miscellaneous undesirables that are consequences of man-made global warming.</t>

    <t>Outline:Most of Pro's case is focused on CO2. I will prove that CO2 as no threatening potential, even when combined with our other emissions. In order to win, Pro must prove that CO2 is a major threat, as that is the core of his argument.Rebuttal I: CO2 Global Warming PotentialPro argues that humans also give off many other emissions. I acknowledged this in my last round and discussed it's potential as well. Those gases have huge GWPs but are simply too small in the scheme of things.'Assuming the increase in the other gases ppm were the same proportionately, we would be responsible for an increase of nearly 0.20°F. This leaves 1.33°F left that human's are not responsible for.'Men's emissions simply don't account for the number needed to assume the whole of Global Warming is man-made. Methane and Nitrous, as a whole, doesn't match up to CO2 emissions alone. Making up a combined 1.31% of all Global Warming, humans making up 0.113% total (1). As for F gases, they are so few that they, with all their potential, only make up less than 0.072% of all Global Warming Potential. They are all combined to form the Misc section. We see the total GWP of Misc, Methane, Nitrious, and CO2 in a visual display.Pro's numbers are correct, but they only represent what percent of the total MAN-MADE GWP those gases make up. But when compared to the total GWP from both men and nature, it only account for 0.278%. This is far too small to be a threat to the World. I've already discussed this, and will display the chart again.GAS -- GREENHOUSE EFFECT -- HUMAN EFFECTWater Vapor ------ 95.000% -- 0.001%Carbon Dioxide -- 3.618% ---- 0.117%Methane ----------- 0.360 ------ 0.066%Nitrous oxide ------ 0.950% ---- 0.047%Misc ----------------- 0.072% ---- 0.047%Total ----------------- 100% ------- 0.278% 1). Rebuttal II: Deforestation and Indirect Emissions.I understand this argument well. I've debated it before. CO2 emissions from Deforestation is calculated into the amount listed above. Making up a pretty percent of our total emissions. Deforestation, however, isn't an issue. US forests are larger today than they were 100 years ago.(2) The US's forest growth is 42% larger than it's forest harvesting. The world replants almost every tree removed, with the UN (apart from the US) replanting 1.7 billion trees (3) and the US replanting 1.5 billion trees a year (4), the world isn't far behind it's deforestation rate. At a total replanting rate of 3.2 billion trees a year + plus ever tree planted by lumber companies. Many lumber company replants trees they cut down to ensure they always have a supply. Forests are not disappearing at close to the rate most people assume they are. It would take over 150 years for the forests in the world to be cut in half, based off US/UN replanting alone. With Lumber Companies replacement programs and all other private replantings, as well has natural Forest Growth, we may never see it at the current rate of deforestation.As for CO2 emitted by Deforestation, it's outwieghed by the amount of CO2 consumed over the lifespan of all the trees we replant. Cutting down a tree and turning it into lumber releases 1,200 lb of CO2. Ever tree we replant consumes 12,000 lb throughout it's life. This adds up, as in one year we will release 2.3 Gigatonnes cutting down trees, but the trees replanted that same year will consume 19 Gigatonnes in their lifes. A mighty profit. After the 88 years it would take to cut down every tree that is alive at this moment, we will have emitted 237.6 Gigatonnes, but the trees we replanted would have consumed a grand 661.17 Gigatonnes by then, after calculating the total consumption of CO2 every year. The first year's trees would consume 6.7 Gigatonnes by then, the next years would consume 6.67 Gigatonnes, and so on.As for ocean pollution, this is true that Ocean Pollution is a bad situation, but Pro hasn't proven that it's enough of a threat to make the Resolution true. CO2 and all it's emittions simply aren't strong enough to support Pro's case and prove the Resolution.CO2, at it's GWP, has far to go before it's a major issue. Until then, Human's aren't leaving around nearly a large enough amount to hurt the environment. Total World Emissions, including humans, only accounts for slightly above 3% of the total Green House Effect. It and every other gas Pro mentioned makes up in total 5%. If you only look at the Man-Made gases, it's only 0.555% of total effect. We know CO2 isn't that bad in the scheme of things because of how CO2 levels were around 7000 PPM in the Cambrian Period, and yet the temperature was only 10ºc higher, showing the CO2 doesn't have nearly the effect Global Warming Alarmists are predicting. Pro's own rebuttal only makes this more clear, as we will see.2 .Rebuttal III: Global Warming Cycle.Yes, CO2 is 400 PPM now, which is pretty high compared to recent cycles, temperatures are still lower than any other warming period. This is prove supporting my case. This Global Warming Period has the highest CO2 PPM (and I never said we weren't responsible for the increase in CO2, as we are, just that CO2 isn't a huge threat) and yet it is the coldest warming period to date. This is clear evidence that CO2 isn't a threat.I already knew the charts were 50 years out of date, I was hoping Pro would notice, as the charts only proof that while CO2 rises during the warming periods, it doesn't cause the warming, otherwise we would be in the hottest warming period in the last 400,000 years. Looking at the charts again, we see that, at 400 ppm, CO2 is high, but we know Global Temperatures is 1.53°F higher than 1900 at this very moment, which makes it the coldest period. Looking at the charts, we see that the coldest warming period is about 2.2°c warming than the 1950 record, while today isn't even a forth that.'As you can see, CO2 emissions are actually much much higher than they have ever been in natural history - 100 PPMs higher than ever.' -ProThis is ignorant of my arguments about how high CO2 was in the Mesozoic and Cambrian Eras. Despite the high amount of CO2, which only looks high compared to recent history, both the Cambrian and current temperatures are well under what people claim they should be. We are colder now than any other warming period in recent history, despite high CO2, because CO2 isn't that big of an issue.As for Pro's R2 points, they are mostly an Argument From Authority, from a group of people who are paid to question how humans effect Global Warming, not how Nature might also effect it.Conclusion:CO2 and all the Gases humans release do not have the power needed to prove Man-Made Global Warming is a threat. As far as numbers and data go, The mass of Global Warming we see is natural, and would happen with or without human involvememt. As said in my R2 case, CO2 has been rising since 9000 years ago, and despite high amounts of it, we still have the coldest Warming Peroid in the last 400,000 years.</t>

    <t>Points Ceded by Con-GHGs are at an all time high-Humans do emit large quantities of GHGs (which he claims is too small in proportion to general emissions)-The ocean is losing its ability to absorb GHGsDefencesI. CO2 and GHGs'Pro argues that humans also give off many other emissions. I acknowledged this in my last round and discussed it's potential as well. Those gases have huge GWPs but are simply too small in the scheme of things.''Pro's numbers are correct, but they only represent what percent of the total MAN-MADE GWP those gases make up. But when compared to the total GWP from both men and nature, it only account for 0.278%.'These arguments may seem compelling at a first glance, but that is only if one doesn't take into account climate sensitivity. Climate sensitivity is how sensitive the global climate is to energy change in the lower atmosphere. Cons argument rests on the concept that climate sensitivity is low. This is not true. Climate sensitivity is highEssentially, climate sensitivity is how much our climate warms if we double the CO2 in the atmosphere. (A) Climate SensitivityClimate sensitivity is high. If man continue to put out CO2 emissions the way we do now, the global warming trend will accelerate. The nature of global warming is such that the more heat that is trapped on earth, the worse the effects of global warming become. This is primarily because as the ocean becomes warmer and warmer, it lessens it's ability to absorb natural gas. Doubling the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere will raise global temperatures by a minimum of 2 degrees Celsius. A conservative estimate places this number closer to 4.5 degrees Celsius. (1)With the extent of man-made CO2 and its impact clearly made explicit we move on to directly address Cons case regarding the % of emissions of man-made CO2 in comparison t natural emissions.(B) The significance of man-made CO2 emissionsMy opponent argues 'Pro's numbers are correct, but they only represent what percent of the total MAN-MADE GWP those gases make up. But when compared to the total GWP from both men and nature, it only account for 0.278%. This is far too small to be a threat to the World.'Again, this may seem compelling, but when we investigate what the effect of man-made CO2 actually is, we see his point is not so compelling. Let's talk equilibrium. Equilibrium is the state where opposing forces are balanced. Nature naturally seeks this equilibrium. The massive numbers Con shows that come through natural emissions do not stay in the atmosphere (historically). Before man began to emit large amounts of CO2, nearly all natural CO2 emissions were absorbed by the ocean or the trees. The emissions were at equilibrium with the absorption. Man made GHGs have thrown this equilibrium totally out of whack. The emissions that are naturally produced do not stay in the atmosphere, and therefore do not contribute to the greenhouse effect. Man-made emissions do indeed remain in the atmosphere. (2) Consider the following graphMan made GHGs accumulate in the atmosphere and quickly accelerate the effects of the Greenhouse Effect, and thus contribute significantly to global warming. 'About 40% of this additional CO2 is absorbed. The rest remains in the atmosphere, and as a consequence, atmospheric CO2is at its highest level in 15 to 20 million years (Tripati 2009). (A natural change of 100ppm normally takes 5,000 to 20,000 years. The recent increase of 100ppm has taken just 120 years).' (2)'While fossil-fuel derived CO2 is a very small component of the global carbon cycle, the extra CO2 is cumulative because the natural carbon exchange cannot absorb all the additional CO2.' (2)'Additional confirmation that rising CO2 levels are due to human activity comes from examining the ratio of carbon isotopes (eg ? carbon atoms with differing numbers of neutrons) found in the atmosphere. Carbon 12 has 6 neutrons, carbon 13 has 7 neutrons. Plants have a lower C13/C12 ratio than in the atmosphere. If rising atmospheric CO2comes from fossil fuels, the C13/C12 should be falling. Indeed this is what is occurring (Ghosh 2003). The C13/C12 ratio correlates with the trend in global emissions.' (2)This irrefutable points out that although Con is correct in saying that the natural carbon cycle emits more CO2, the Man-made emissions have a much more potent effect on the atmosphere.Subpoint A points out the sever nature of the effects, as a rise of 2 degrees Celsius could have very severe consequences (1)SummaryMan emits a lot of GHGs. Nature emits way more, but the GHGs do not stay in the atmosphere. Mans GHGs are a major cause of global warming, as man-made GHGs remain in the atmosphere, unlike natural GHGs. The earth warms significantly. This warming further reduces the oceans ability to absorb GHGs, further increasing the damage done by Man.II. Indirect emissions(A) The effectiveness of replantingCon is correct in saying that more trees are planted than cut down, but this does not mean that GHGs are more effectively curbed. The fact is, older trees actually absorb more GHGs than younger trees.'Trees' growth accelerates with age, according to a new study in the journal Nature, which suggests that the world's oldest trees could play an important role in combating climate change. The revelation goes against the long-held assumption that trees lose their vigor with age. An analysis of more than 600,000 trees belonging to 403 species found that trees grow more as they get older, which enables them to trap more carbon than their younger counterparts.' (3) (B) The ocean, and heatingThe ocean absorbs around 40% of all carbon emissions, natural or man-made. (4)Warming the ocean significantly reduces its ability to absorb GHGs. As I have proved, Man-Made GHGs warm the earth significantly more so than natural GHGs. Natural GHGs that remain in the atmosphere due to the warming of the ocean via man-made GHGs are just indirect emissions from man. 'The world’s oceans will absorb lower amounts of carbon dioxide as they warm' (4)Therefore, you can see that humanity raises the global average by only a few degrees Celsius, and the effects of that damage 'snowballs' out of control, and results in disastrous levels of damage. SummaryI, the pro, have proved irrefutably that man-made GHGs are responsible for the warming cycles that expert environmental scientists claim to be 'impossible to be natural.' I have proved as well that man-made GHGs stay in the atmosphere longer, and therefore contribute much more to the greenhouse effect. This warming snow-balls and causes even more natural CO2 to be trapped in the atmosphere. These massive amounts of GHGs in the atmosphere heat the earth through the greenhouse effect. These GHGs are in the atmosphere because of man.Therefore, VOTE PRO! </t>
<h> Warming the ocean significantly reduces its ability to absorb GHGs. Man-Made GHGs warm the earth significantly more so than natural GHGs. Natural GHGs that remain in the atmosphere due to the warming of the ocean via man-made GHGs are just indirect emissions from man.</h>

    <t>I thank my opponent for his response.RebuttalsThe Greenhouse potential of CO2This is actually an excellent point made by my opponent. There are two problems with it, though.A) Man realeases many other, potent, greenhouse gases.B) Man contributes to global warming in more ways than just producing greenhouse gases.(A) The greenhouse gamut of gasesMan produces more than just CO2 grenhouse gases. Man is also directly responsible for CH4 (methane) emissions, N20 (Nitrous Oxide) emissions, and Chlorofluorocarbons ('F' Gases). Here is a chart depicting the full impact of these gases.  • Carbon dioxide (CO2). Accounts for around three-quarters of the warming impact of current human greenhouse-gas emissions. The key source of CO2 is the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, though deforestation is also a very significant contributor. • Methane (CH4). Accounts for around 14% of the impact of current human greenhouse-gas emissions. Key sources include agriculture (especially livestock and rice fields), fossil fuel extraction and the decay of organic waste in landfill sites. Methane doesn't persist in the atmosphere as long as CO2, though its warming effect is much more potent for each gram of gas released. • Nitrous oxide (N2O). Accounts for around 8% of the warming impact of current human greenhouse-gas emissions. Key sources include agriculture (especially nitrogen-fertilised soils and livestock waste) and industrial processes. Nitrous oxide is even more potent per gram than methane. • Fluorinated gases ('F gases'). Account for around 1% of the warming impact of current human greenhouse-gas emissions. Key sources are industrial processes. F-gases are even more potent per gram than nitrous oxide. (1)  The emissions for CO2 from man alone may not account for the upward trend, but it is certainly not natural cycles. National Geographic writes, 'Scientists have spent decades figuring out what is causing global warming. They've looked at the natural cycles and events that are known to influence climate. But the amount and pattern of warming that's been measured can't be explained by these factors alone. The only way to explain the pattern is to include the effect of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted by humans.' (2)Man produces quite a bit of methane gases as well. Every methane molecule has 20 times the greenhouse potential of CO2 (2). Man actually produces 50-100 million tonnes of methane per year. This is due to the massive increase of two forms of agriculture: Beef and rice. The digestive systems of cows happen to produce a sizeable amount of methane, and rice paddies produce quite a bit as well. (3)To give these combined gases some perspective, imagine that all human gases were measured relative to CO2. Since 1990 alone, we, humanity, have increased our GHG emissions by the equivalent of 6 Gigatons of CO2, a 20% increase. (2)(B) Man contribute to the greenhouse effect both directly, and indirectly.The direct method in which man contributes to the greenhouse effect is through direct emissions of greenhouse gases. The indirect method, though, is limiting the earths ability to curb GHGs presence in our atmosphere. The two most notable effects are deforestation and oceanic pollution. I. DeforestationThe most effective way in which the earth curbs the amount of GHGs produced (specifically, CO2) is through the forests of the earth. The earths forests converts CO2 into O2 and glucose, thus reducing the amount of GHGs present in the atmosphere. Deforestation practices, however, have significantly reduced the earths ability to reduce the presence of CO2.'By most accounts, deforestation in tropical rainforests adds more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than the sum total of cars and trucks on the world’s roads. According to the World Carfree Network (WCN), cars and trucks account for about 14 percent of global carbon emissions, while most analysts attribute upwards of 15 percent to deforestation.' (4)This results in a much higher quantity of CO2 present in the atmosphere that is a result of mans interference with the environment.II. Pollution of the OceanThe ocean is also a fairly major player in the environment, and GHGs. The ocean naturalyl absorbs GHGs and reduces their concentration. Warming the environment, though, significantly reduces the oceans ability to combat the increase of GHGs.'There’s an important relationship between the atmosphere and our oceans, which is out of balance due to climate change pollution. As oceans warm, they lose their ability to absorb carbon dioxide, causing them to become 'acidified.'' (5).SummaryEven if CO2 initially has very little effect on the enironvment, we can see that the initial effects can quickly spiral out of control and 'snowball' into a much more severe effect. Man produces many more GHGs than through simple CO2 emissions. The way in which we cause the greenhouse effect is complex, but almost assuradly the most major cause of modern global warming, as is the scientific census (see Point B, Sub-point 1).Nature and Global Warming/The global warming cycle.Up until about 1950 (where many of my opponents graphs end) the warming period was totally accounted for by natual causes. It wasn't until after then that we began to realize that natual cycles cannot account for modern global warming.Here is a chart illustrating CO2 emissions in PPMs from NASA.As you can see, CO2 emissions are actually much much higher than they have ever been in natural history - 100 PPMs higher than ever. Furthermore, my Point B Subpoint 1 argument shows that the environmental scientific community is in total agreement: Natural cycles simply do not account for modern global warming. The United States Global Change Research Program (which includes the Department of Defense, NASA, National Science Foundation and other government agencies) has said 'global warming is unequivocal and primarily human-induced'SummaryThere are countless sources in my R1 argument, and in this argument, that show that the only explanation for the massive upward trend in global average temperatures is that humanity is significantly exacerbating the natural cycle, causing a warming cycle more extreme than any warming cycles in history.I reiterate, Natual Cycles cannot account for modern global warming, and environmental scientists are all in agreement over this point. Via GHG emissions-both directly.</t>

    <t>Con's case:Premise 1: Global Warming PotentialWhat few people realize about things like Green House Gas is that they are not all born equal. For example, Carbon Dioxide has a Global Warming Potential of 1. Global Warming Potential is the total effect a single amount of gas has on Global Warming. The list is has follows: (1)Carbon Dioxide -- 1Methane -- 21Nitrous Oxide -- 298-310CFC's -- VariousWater Vapor -- 0.25With this in mind, we move on.1). Argument I: The Effects of Man-Made Carbon Dioxide.Human's release approximately 35 gigatons of Carbon Dioxide into the atmosphere each year (2). Only 4.3% of the 812 gigatons released total every year. Even at only 4.3% of total CO2 emmissions, our effect over it, is mild at most. Carbon Dioxide is very weak, as opposed to common census, having only a Global Warming Potential of 1.In total, Carbon Dioxide makes up a grand total of 3.618% of the total Gas House Effect (3). Water vapor makes up 95% of the total Greenhouse Effect. Carbon Dioxide's number increased from 295 ppm to 400 ppm, an increase of 105 ppm. 1 Gigaton of CO2 is worth 2.13 ppm (4), so an increase of 105 ppm would equal 49.29 gigatons. Since 1 gigaton of CO2 is worth 0.004% of total Greenhouse Effect, 49.29 gigatons is worth an additional 0.21% to the Greenhouse Effect, a total temperature increase of 0.15°F. That means we are responsible for 10% of total increased warming.Assuming human's did in fact raise the amount of CO2 by 105 ppm, the effect on the climate would be measly. Temperatures would raise only 0.28% since then. People gravely exaggerate to effect of CO2 on the climate. It is the second weakest Greenhouse Gas in the world behind Water Vapor. GAS -- GREENHOUSE EFFECT -- HUMAN EFFECTWater Vapor ------ 95.000% -- 0.001%Carbon Dioxide -- 3.618% ---- 0.117%Methane ------------ 0.360 ------ 0.066%Nitrous oxide ----- 0.950% ---- 0.047%Misc ------------------- 0.072% ---- 0.047%Total ------------------ 100% ------- 0.278% Assuming the increase in the other gases ppm were the same proportionately, we would be responsible for an increase of nearly 0.20°F. This leaves 1.33°F left that human's are not responsible for.Many people would claim we've caused temperatures to raise enough to evaporate enough water to make up the difference. This would be entirely irrational. At an increase of 0.20°F, water wouldn't evaporate much more than it was prior. Thats less of a difference in tempature shift than what we'd see from one minute to the next. The argument assumes 0.20°F can heat up the ocean enough to make up such a wide difference. Such an increase from only 0.20°F would mean that the ocean would be boiling in the summer (temperatures of 90°F and up, an increase of 31.88°F from normal temperature). It's a weak and unsustainable excuse. Even at 1.53°F, it's not likely.2). Argument II: Argument From Nature:Is it entirely possible for nature to be responsible? Of course. Nature has seen worse times then now. CO2 ppm is at 400 right now, but in the Mesozoic period, long before man, it reached 2000-4000 ppm.(5) 7000 ppm in the Cambrian Period. This implies that people aren't needed for absolutely unbelievable increases in ppm. It's entirely possible for nature to do this on it's own. Another issue this brings up is that, at 7000 ppm, 6705 ppm larger than in 1900 (63.8% larger than the 105 ppm increase) the temperatures were 10ºc higher then than today. Proportionately, temperatures should have been 54.23ºc higher then than today. This empathizes high little of an impact CO2 has on the global temperature.So what in nature right now could be causing such in increase in temperature? A basic cycle.5) Argument III: The Global Warming Cycle:Global Warming activists love mentioning how temperatures are higher now than they were in Human History, forgetting how Human History is only 10,000 years old at most.In the chart above, we see that past warming periods. Take into account that the temperature of today is now above anything on that list, and then look at the past 400,000 years.According to the data, the World has been heating and cooling rapidly for 100's of thousands of years, back past a few million, even. It has been the world's cycle. CO2 ppm has been following along. Right now it's where it should be increasing. CO2 has been raising in recent history (15,000 years) and it's merely continuing to, with or without humans. Temperatures, as well, have been randomly going up and down in the past 15,000 years. Long before industrialization. Of course temperatures are up... We're in the warming cycle. We are actually in the coldest warming cycle in the past 400,000 years, the fact that it isn't warmer is amazing. To assume human's are responsible is more Post Hoc then anything else. Temperatures SHOULD be increasing right now. It's only natural.CO2 is so unimportant, that despite a rapid increase around the 9,000 year period, temperatures have decreased more than increased, and quite on it's own accord.Conclusion:Human's are responsible for very little of the Green House Effect. Our biggest contribution is CO2, which (and my opponent will probably stick to CO2 as his weapon) is very uninfluencial in the overall scheme of things. The increase in CO2 has been going on steadily since over 9,000 years ago. It's nothing new.There is nothing unique about this warming period other than how cold it is. Human's contribution to Global Warming is minuscule, and isn't a threat to human life. Global Warming might be a risk, at most, in time, while not likely... But Man-Made Global Warming is not.</t>
<h>    Since 1 gigaton of CO2 is worth 0.004% of total Greenhouse Effect, 49.29 gigatons is worth an additional 0.21% to the Greenhouse Effect, a total temperature increase of 0.15°F. That means we are responsible for 10% of total increased warming.</h>

    <t>Outline: With most of Pro's argument based off the effect of CO2, I simply have to show that CO2 has a minor effect on Global Warming. I already have the historical data to prove it.Rebuttal I: Importance of CO2Pro brings up Climate Sensitivity. It's a common and exaggerated argument. The GWP measures how sensitive the Climate is to that element. 1 Gigaton of vapor has far less than the effect on the climate of half a Gigaton of CO2. Climate Sensitivity has already been addressed as soon as GWP was brought into the discussion. That being said, with a GWP of 1, not much is happening to the climate...My argument about the Cambrian Era emphasizes this. At 7000 ppm, The climate was only 10ºc. If the climate was as sensitive to CO2 as Pro claims, the Cambrian Era would have been 50ºc higher or more, and literally unsurvivable for the Dinosaurs living during it. If climate was as fragile as Pro claims, we would be in, by far, the hottest warming period in the last 400,000 year, not the coldest. Those two things are issues Pro's argument simply disreguards.A) Climate SensitiveClimate Sensitivity is hardly as intense as Pro claims. If you view my charts in R3, you will again see that CO2 is 25% higher than any other period, but the temperature hasn't followed. Why? Because CO2 doesn't have a large effect on temperature. I've already done the math in R2 showing that the increase in CO2 only accounts for 0.15°F of the total increase in temperature, which says a lot, since the total increase in temperature still leaves us freezing in comparison to other warming periods.The claim about the potention effect CO2 has and what the actual data say just aren't agreeing. Climate Sensitivity would have took effect in the Cambrian era as well, and let the tempature was well under what Pro needs to back his case.B) Man-Made CO2Much of Pro's argument is based on how much CO2 human's release... Which I've already brought up. We do tip the pot, I've said this... And we did increase the amount of CO2 in the air, I've said this... And yet the data STILL says it's doing little to nothing. Why? Because, again, CO2 is weak. The amount we release simply isn't doing anything. Again looking at my math in R2, the total increase in CO2 has had an affect of 0.15°F.Pro is arguing in circles. 'CO2 is increasing' 'The increase is doing nothing' 'But the CO2 is increasing.' Pro is simply arguing in circles, repeating his last round. We already brought up the increase in CO2, I already explained the insignificance of the increase... I even brought up how much we added... In fact, my numbers were higher than Pro's (35 Gigatons to Pro's 29 Gigatons). The increase in CO2 has been recorded, and the increase in temperature has been recording, and the correlation is small and unsupportive of Pro's case.Pro is chasing his tail, and begging the question. Claiming the increase in CO2 is bad because we are increasing CO2, ignoring every argument made showing how little of an affect that increase actually has. Pro is showing how much it's increasing, but as let to show the affect of that increase. I have shown the affect of that increase, and it is minor.Rebuttal II: Indirect EmissionsIt should be mentioned that Indirect Emissions aren't ignored when measuring PPM. The 400 ppm still includes those. That being said, Indirect Emissions have already been calculated, and do not hold some potential that was overlooked in the chart's I've shown. The increase in CO2 from Indirect Emissions isn't hidden. We see it just like we see any other. They were already accounted for.A) Tree Replanting.My math, in regards to CO2 consumption, is based on an average rate. Not the rate at which new trees consume CO2. Even if the amount consumed was much smaller, it doesn't say much against how wide the gap was. 661.17 Gigatons consumed compared to 237.6 Gigatons made. The total consumption rate by the end of 88 years would have to be cut down by 63%. Odds are, the decrease in CO2 consumption will likely never be that extreme. The gap in Consumption and Emissions is simply too large. If cut in half, the Consumption would be widely above Emission.B) Ocean and HeatingThis argument is flawed in that it ignores just how small the temperature increase from man-made emissions is. As explained, human emissions (all emission, Methane, Nitrous, and F Gases included) is responsible for an increase of 0.20°F, the rest being natural. Pro gravely exaggerates the affect of CO2 on the ocean's ability to absorb CO2. If it was as sensitive as he claims, once the extremely hot Summer season hits the ocean, it would never end. Also the increase needed, being several degrees Celsius, as Pro mentions, is far from the current increase. Assume it takes 4°c... It would take 666 years to reach that, as it took 134 years to see temperature increase by 0.85°c. This is a causational paradox. Claiming that Global Warming is causing X to create Global Warming. What's causing the temperature to rise? The Ocean's efficency going down. What's causing it to go down? The rising temperature that it was causing. Claiming that X, caused by Y, is causing Y to cause X in the first place. As well, all pro is doing is listing off new ways CO2 is building up. My data includes TOTAL ppm, including direct and indirect. That 400 ppm we are taking about doesn't somehow exclude CO2 from the ocean. For EVERY way pro claims CO2 is raising, it still doesn't prove CO2 is influential enough to be a threat, while my data shows it isn't.Final Defense:CO2 just doesn't have the needed impact to claim human's are responsible for most of Global Warming. The Cambrian Era and the past 400,000 years went unchallenged. Every variable Pro brought up would have effected temperatures in the past as well, and yet the temperature in the Cambrian era was well under what it'd have to be for Pro's claim to be true.As the data shows, the Cambrian Era (550 mya to 480 mya) was nearly 8°c above today, despite having 17x the CO2. This chart, like all my other charts, takes into account the whole temperature as it is/was. Every variable and hidden factor that Pro brings in is accounted for. If it's not, that's because the variable literally didn't effect the temperature. The temperature doesn't exclude increases from the decrease in CO2 consumption in the Ocean, if that increases temperature, we'll see it on the chart. With every variable took into effect, temperature to CO2 ratio just doesn't add up to Pro's claim. If CO2 was as capable of the kind of Global Warming Pro claims, directly and indirectly, temperatures in the Cambrian era, and today, would be much higher. Pro acts as though every variable he brought up doesn't show up on my charts, as though they only now exist. They have been involved the whole time. The temperature has increased 1.5°F, that increase is already caused by every variable Pro mentioned, and yet it's still leaves us with the coldest warming period in the last 400,000 years, and my math (using the GWP of thg gases) only makes up a small portion of that increase. To small of an increase to snowball out control. If an increase of 0.20°F is enough to cause what Pro claims, Summer would be devastating.All of Pro's arguments simply ignores the data.As seen in my charts, CO2 rises with temperature, but isn't causing (most) of the temperature increase. The argument is Post Hoc. CO2 may rise with tempature, but it doesn't cause the temperature. If it did, the Cambrian era would e 4-5x hotter, and we'd be at least 6x hotter. History simply shows that CO2 isn't strong enough to have a major impact on tempature.1). Conclusion: Men-made Global Warming doesn't make up a large part of the Global Warming cycle, and isn't a threat.CO2's effect is small, as has been seen long ago and today. In order for Pro's arguments to be accurate and right, temperatures today must be well above all the temperatures of the last 400,000 years. The fact that temperatures have barely risen with CO2 shows the minimal impact CO2 has on it.Pro's arguments are begging the question. He claims CO2 level raising are an issue because we are increasing CO2, ignoring that data, and GWP of CO2, deems the increase near harmless.CO2 simply does not bare to Global Warming Impact needed to prove Pro's case. Human's are not responsible for most the temperature increase, and our influence simply isn't a threat to humanity.</t>

    <t>Final Defense:Defense 1: Global Warming Potential of CO2The Global Warming Potential of CO2 is, simply said, weak. So weak that it does little to affect Global Temperatures even with massive sums of it in the air. Despite how focused we are on CO2, it simply isn't as big a deal to the environment, and history backs this up. At 400 PPM at the present, this should be the hottest Global Warming cycle of all time, but it is the coldest. The two don't correlate well enough. CO2 rises with temperature, but temperature doesn't really rise well with it.Temperatures are actually low. Through out history, CO2 will correlate when temperatures rose, but temperatures didn't follow well when CO2 rose, often well under the CO2 count of that era. This is for the same reason that today is colder than any other Global Warming Cycle. The effect CO2 has on Global Warming is minimal at most, and not qualified as a *threat to humanity*. With a GWP of only 1, history emphasizes the weakness of the gas, while people exaggerate the strength of it. At only 3.6% of the total GWP effect, and humans at only 0.117% of that, human emissions are not a threat to the planet.Defense II: Other Gases and Earth's Sensitivity.All other human emissions are greatly small in comparison to CO2, even with higher Global Warming Potentials. F-gases and other poisonous substances we throw into the air have massive GWPs, but are so small in number, that all put together still only effects 0.072% of the total Greenhouse Effect, and human's are responsible for only 0.047% of that. The gases, all together, contribute only 2% of what CO2 does, and since the evidence and history shows CO2 does little, we can only assume our other gases do much less.Earth's Sensitivity is high, but it is gravely exaggerated upon. History shows that, specifically the Cambrian Era. If Earth's Sensitivity was as high as people claim, and 400 PPM CO2 or anything close to it could cause a major snowballing effect, we would have seen it there. At 7000 ppm, the Cambrian Era should have snowballed into temperatures we can't measure on conventional thermostats. And the sea level would have been well below ours, not 30-90 meters above. The Snowballing effect simply isn't there, not for CO2 at least.A) DeforestationDeforestation does release a lot of CO2, but this CO2 isn't hidden from view, it is accounted for in every measurement I made. Having done the math, Total CO2 consumption from trees we replant over the next 88 years is well above 3x the amount we produce through deforestation based on an average annual consumption per tree... Even if CO2 Consumption was half as effective the whole of the next 88 years, we would still see it 100 gigatons above emissions (a decrease of 213 ppm worth, or 850 ppm at the original measurements).Defense III: Global Warming CycleThe past millions of years have seen a continuous cycle of Global Warming. Each one hotter than today's, despite lower CO2 emissions. Assuming Humans are responsible for Global Warming is more Post Hoc, since our emissions are minimal in effect. This Global Warming Cycle has been going on long before human's began throwing out emissions, and CO2 has been rising since 9,000 years ago. That being said, it's more likely that natural CO2 emissions having been growing as well, otherwise CO2 ppm should have been going down until the Industrial Age.Assuming CO2 causes most Global Warming is ignorant of the history of Global Warming, where high amounts of CO2 never correlated well with equally high temperature, as is the same today. At least, not in a way that supports the notion that CO2 plays a major part in increasing temperatures. The Global Warming Cycle in the past 400,000 years has never seen CO2 PPM this high before, being 25% higher than any other example. Temperature is, however, the coldest. This is because CO2 has never been a major part of Global Warming. Correlating with it, but not causing it. The Global Warming Cycle of the past 400,000 years prove this, as well as Global Warming in the deep past. In the Cambrian Era and Mesozoic Era, CO2 was wildly above ours, but temperature was't proportionately as high. The Current Global Warming cycle is entirely natural. Looking back at the charts, we should be in a warming cycle. Saying Global Warming is mostly man-made is ignorant of the fact that this cycle looks just like every cycle.Final Conclusion: Human emissions contribute little to Global Warming, which is evident in how cold our current cycle is. CO2 has never increased temperatures to any proportionate amount, and the Earth Snowball-Sensitive effect just isn't present in any historical data.Pro has dropped the case of CO2 consumption from tree replanting.I have proven how:  CO2 has a minimal effect, even when compiled. Deforestation isn't nearly the issue it's exageratted to be. The Earths Sensitivity isn't nearly intense enough to cause a massive Snow-balling effect. We are colder than any other Warming Period. How natural Global Warming is.  I have proven that CO2. and man-made gases, simply contributes little to nothing, as history and even today's chart prove. Thank you for this debate, Pro.Vote Con!</t>

    <t>ConclusionFinal Defences(A) Climate sensitivityMy opponent attempts to prove that the climate sensitivity is exaggerated, but gives no sources to suggest that climate sensitivity is really exaggerated the way he explains. The source I cited is written by an environmental scientist, who has posted the calculations on how he calculated climate sensitivity. He dismisses them by pointing to the cambrian era, but this is not an acceptable rebuttal. Climate sensitivity is not static. The cambrian era likely had a lower level of climate sensitivity.(B) Man Made CO2I've stated that CO2 'tips the pot' and proved it. Con cedes this. Con says that I agree that CO2 does nothing. This is not true. In my previous arguments, I've stated that although CO2 does have a low GWP, doesn't mean that it is non-existent. My point is not begging the question, as I have argued a point of instigation: when man emitted large volumes of CO2. The majority of CO2 and other misc. GHGS that remain in the atmosphere are man-made, as I proved in my R4 argument. The GWP of CO2 in particular may be low, but it still has GWP. Every fraction of a degree that the temp is raised by CO2 further accelerates the global warming effect by reducing the oceans ability to absorb CO2 (as I stated in my R4 argument). My opponents points, when freshly cross examined with my previous points, can be seen as invalid.Con cedes that Man-made CO2 emissions disrupt the CO2 cycle. This disproves his point regarding the cambrian era (as man was not present, the CO2 cycle would have been in balance). Con cedes that warming oceans have lessened ability to absorb CO2, but claims that this point is begging the question. Pro proves that that point is not begging the question, as the initial warming is instigated by the CO2 (and other GHGs) that man emits that disrupt the natural cycle.The correlation isn't low, as con states. The earth is warming, directly after man disrupts the CO2 cycle. Con may dismiss scientific consensus as an appeal to authority, but it can be argued that if literally thousands of expert climatologists are in agreement that there is sufficient evidence to say that man-made global warming is significantly changing the environment, then they are probably correct.C) TreesCon cedes that Older trees more efficiently absorb CO2, than younger trees. Forward this point.D) Warming OceansCon attempts to disprove this point simply by saying ' once the extremely hot Summer season hits the ocean, it would never end.' But this is simply forced misinterpretation of how the ocean is affected by the world temperature. One hot summer does not warm the ocean sufficiently to see a drastic change in its ability to absorb, as the entire planet is hot during one regions summer. Only global rising averages really shift the temperature of the ocean. 'Assume it takes 4°c... It would take 666 years to reach that, as it took 134 years to see temperature increase by 0.85°c.'This is an interesting point made by con, but totally fails to account for temperature acceleration. This point is only true if one assumes that the rate at which temperature changes is always constant. If one looked at the 134 year period he mentions, you would see that the rate of warming accelerated, and was fastest during the latter portion.Final StatementsMy opponents final argument has boiled down to essentially 2 points.1) CO2 has a low GWP 2) The cambrian era had a ton of CO2, but wasn't as hot as it 'should' have been. Both points are easily rebutted by my previous arguments. Point one is rebutted in that I have proved that although CO2 has a low GWP, doesn't mean that it is negligable. I have proved previously that any amount of warming caused by CO2 has the potential to accelerate out of control.Point two is rebutted by my climate sensitivty argument, and my carbon cycle argument. It is rebutted by my climate sensitivity argument, in that the cambrian era likely had lower sensitivity. It is rebutted by my CO2 cycle argument, in that the cambrian era CO2 cycle was not disrupted by unnatural interference. Note: These are cross-examinations, not new rebuttals.These are the points ceded by Con.-Man made GHGs disrupt the natural cycle of GHG emissions and absorbtion. -Man made GHGs remain in the atmosphere, unlike natural GHGs, and can build up in the atmosphere, therefore significantly contributing to the greenhouse effect.-Deforestation contributes significantly to the reduction of the natural absorbtion of GHGs.-When the ocean warms, its ability to absorb CO2 is reduced.-Therefore, warming from CO2 (among other GHGs) has the potential to accelerate the greenhouse effect.Con has zero assertions standing in his argument. The Pro has a multitude of points that all indicate that man is significantly contributing to global warming. The evidence for Pro is overwhelming. The scientific backing is solid. That is the reason why environmental scientists have come to the census that they did.Con has no argument.VOTE PRO!</t>

    <t>Thanks for accepting this debate I hope we have a great debate! Evidence is only to be presented when asked for Last speeches, no new evidence is to be presented 1st speech- opening 2nd- rebuttals 3rd- more rebuttals 4th- summary 5th- Closing statement Good luck! PRO- Case Definitions  First, we offer the CIA World Factbook's definition of 'developed countries,' which includes just over thirty nations that are generally first-world and feature service-oriented economies.  Standard- The standard of today's debate, or weighing mechanism, should be deontology. Since this topic is about moral obligations and deontology is about the morality of actions and its justification, we believe that the team that adheres to this standard should win this debate.  1. Alternative- Adaptation Adapting is the correct way to go in the process of mitigating. Since today's topic is about mitigating the effects of climate change, and not mitigating climate change, as the affirmative team, it is our ground to be able to 'adapt' to the effects of climate change.  According to epa.gov, some of the effects of climate change are that heavy rainfall or flooding can increase water-borne parasites that are sometimes found in drinking water. These parasites can cause, in severe cases, death. One instance to mitigating the effects of climate change includes vaccinating, which is cheap and extremely effective. According to givewell.org, it costs only $14 to vaccinate a child, and The UNICEF states that 9 million lives are saved from vaccines annually.  The impact is clear. It would be better to adapt to the effects of climate change. One of the effects is disease, and if we can save all these people from disease by administering vaccines, for a small price of $14 per child, we should win this debate. 2. Economy If developed countries mitigate the effects of climate change, the economy will grow. According to the UN, Renewable energy generates more jobs than fossil fuels. Worldwide, jobs in renewable energy industries exceeded 35 million in 2010. $211 billion were invested in the renewable industries in 2010. Obviously, the renewable energy industries create a bigger impact than fossil fuels, and are capable to generate more jobs in the future than fossil fuel industries will be able to.  A study done by the Natural Resource Defense Council said that if present trends continue, these four global warming impacts alone will come with a price tag of almost 1.9 trillion annually (in today's dollars), by 2100.  The Impact is that Mitigating the effects of climate change is important because of how much it is costing the world. With more jobs being created, the economy is being reboosted. Obviously countries have a moral obligation if climate change is costing them money. 3. Moral Obligation Developed countries have the obligation to fix the mess that they created. After all, it is the developed country's fault, and they should fix it. The United states is making nearly 5,500 million tonnes CO2 emissions (Guardian). Developed Countries should also have the moral obligation to not contribute to campaigns that kill human beings. For example, terrorism:  It is oil money that enables Saudi Arabia [and many other countries] to invest approximately 40% of its income on weapons procurement. In July 2005 undersecretary of the Treasury, Stuart Levey, testifying in the Senate noted 'Wealthy Saudi financiers and charities have funded terrorist organizations and causes that support terrorism and the ideology that fuels the terrorists' agenda. Even today, we believe that Saudi donors may still be a significant source of terrorist financing.' - Institute for the Analysis of Global security. Over 12,000 people were killed by terrorist attacks in 2011- according to the National Counter Terrorism Center  Judge, what this means is that many patrons of terrorism happen to be oil and gasoline investors. If we buy gasoline, these supporters of terrorism would earn money, and stuff their profits into supporting terrorist groups, leading to deaths inside our own country and other places around the world. But if we switch to green energy, we would significantly decrease the profits of these terrorism supporters, and as a result, save many lives.  The Impact is clear. Countries have the moral obligation to solve the problems that they have created, and also to try and save the lives of their own citizens from acts like terrorism, by trying to mitigate the effects of climate change.  4. The Environment Climate Change causes the environment to be affected. All the more reason for countries to mitigate its effects. According to Nasa, Approximately 20-30% of plant and animal species are likely to be at increased risk of extinction if increases in global average temperature exceeds 1.5-2.5'C.  We need to get prepared for four degrees of global warming, Bob Watson [PhD in Chemistry, Award for Scientific Freedom and Responsibility] told the Guardian last month.Weather would become extreme and unpredictable, with more frequent and severe droughts, floods and hurricanes. The Earth's carrying capacity would be hugely reduced. Billions would undoubtedly die.  The Impact is that if the Earth's temperatures rises just the slightest amount, millions might die! We must mitigate these effects before it is too late.</t>

    <t>Developed countries do not have a moral obligation to mitigate the effects of climate change. In this debate, I will be introducing several arguments. Firstly, I will be explaining how developed countries are not in the position to lessen the gravity of climate change, and therefore there is no moral obligation towards them. Secondly I will be talking about how other 'developing countries' have the biggest incentive to reduce emissions, and therefore they must share the burden and the moral obligation towards mitigating the effects. Following on from this, I will be explaining how developing nations are just as capable as developed nations of taking on the burden of climate change.  'Developed countries' are not in the position to mitigate the effects of climate change, and therefore possess no moral obligation to do this. Many economists consider the financial crisis of 2007'2008, the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Countries suddenly found themselves in debt of millions of dollars, along with unemployment rates reaching unprecedented levels. Some of the countries that were affected are indeed considered 'developed countries', and are found on the CIA World Fact book list. These countries include Greece, Portugal, Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Belgium, Ireland, United Kingdom and the United States. The figure for Greek government debt at the end of 2009 was 299.7 billion euros (130% of GDP). This led to disastrous social effects; as showed by the figure for the percentage of people living at 'risk of poverty or social exclusion', calculated at 33% in 2011. In 2011, 111000 Greek companies went bankrupt (27% higher than in 2010). Greece was not the only country that suffered. Spain's economy continues to shrink, whilst unemployment rates have reached 27%. Likewise, unemployment in Portugal is also high, while the government continues to reduce the budget in many important sectors as well as in social welfare. These countries are in no position to mitigate the effects of climate change. They possess an obligation to the peoples of their country: to reduce debt and cut unemployment rates. This must be dealt with, and is their primary moral obligation. If these problems are not dealt with, there will be many more social and political ramifications.  Developing countries have the biggest incentive to reduce the effects of climate change; and thus they must share the moral obligation. Developing countries are expected to be the countries who will suffer the worst effects of climate change, comparatively more developing countries are outside temperate zones so will be harder hit by rising temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns. Unfortunately, it is the case that countries that have the wealth to tackle these problems are not going to take the lead in reducing emissions. These countries must take responsibility and act in response to climate change; as it their responsibility.  The next point ties in with my first argument. I strongly believe developing nations are just as capable as developed nations of taking on the burden of effects of climate change. There is a common assumption that developed countries are the only countries who can battle climate change, because the solutions are technological, and the developed world has better science and research infrastructure. But this view is misleading, small solutions can potentially have a big effect in developing nations. Developing nations are just as capable as developed nations of taking on the burden of climate change, and must take the lead in dealing with the effects.</t>

    <t>Thank You for a timely response,I will first go over my opponent's arguments, then go back to my own.First, my opponent talked about how many countries are in debt, and are not in the position to mitigate climate change.However, Global warming could cost the world up to $20 trillion over two decades for cleaner energy sources and do the most harm to people who can least afford to adapt, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon warns in a new report.- USA today. Judge, 20 trillion dollars is the biggest number in this debate, and you have to look to our side for this argument. Not only that, but my second argument clearly talks about how mitigating the effects of climate change can increase jobs in the renewable energy field. Obsviously, since the benefits outweigh the harms, developed countries should have the moral obligation to mitigate climate change.   Their second argument was that developing countries are the countries who wil suffer the worst and the have a huge incentive. However, my opponent is misunderstanding that point. This is about whether these countries should have a MORAL obligation, and as the pollution of CO2 emmissions from these developing countries are going to be pushed to the devloped countries, we have a moral obligation to mitigate the effects of climate change. In the last quarter of the 20th century, the average atmospheric temperature rose by about 1 degree Fahrenheit. By 2000, that increase was responsible for the annual loss of about 160,000 lives and the loss of 5.5 million years of healthy life, according to estimates by the World Health Organization. The toll is expected to double to about 300,000 lives by 2020. Judge, if my opponent can prove that the developed countries don't have a moral obligation to save so many lives, and if he can show the justification of the deaths of so many people because of climate change, then they should win. If he cannot, you have to vote for the pro. My opponents last argument was essentially that developing countries are the ones with the better ideas. However, my opponent gives not evidence or examples backing this claim up, so it should be disregared.Now, to my side.First, I want to go over that adaptation is still an option. Adapting is always an idea. Vaccines which can save 9 million lives is a significant way to adapt, which will lessen the impacts of climate change, therefore mitigating the effects of climate change. Second, global warming can cause harms to the economy, such as a price tag of 1.9 trillion dollars each year by 2100. Mitigating the effects will enable us to avoid this number, and create more money and jobs.Third, my switching to renewable energy, we can stop sending money to terrorist groups, greatly decreasing their proft.Fourth, the enviornment can be greatly saved, saving millions of human lives as well as near extinct species.

    <t>RE: I forgot to say first round acceptance—that is my fault. I ask my opponent simply doesn’t post rebuttals last round, but he can summarize his arguments. Instead of a rebuttal I will simply write my case. Please note that I didn't make an argument in Round1. Rather I made an appeal for a more complete, less biased definition of the term 'hockey stick' and offered Wikipedia as an objective source. So far, this request has been ignored. I will make my argument in Round2, same as Con. I will refrain from rebuttals in Round4 on the condition Con does likewise. THESIS: The mean surface temperature of the Earth has risen by 0.74±0.18 °C over the period 1906–2012. Two-thirds of that increase (.6C/1F) has occurred since 1980. This peak represents both the highest global temperature of the past 1000 years and the most rapid escalation. As a kind of shorthand, some scientists refer to the graphed geometry of this peak as a 'hockey stick' to evoke a rapid rise after a sustained period of less dramatic change. To the limited degree by which the image of a hockey stick can approximate well-established recent changes in climate, the Hockey Stick is likely correct.Science is not in the business of asserting truths about our world. Rather, the process of science is to offer theories, create experiments to test those theories, analyze and publish results, offer alternative theories that might falsify results.  Theories are then adjusted in response to critique, new experiments are created to test, and so on. The scientific method is a conversation, a continuously refocused and improved loop. To the extent that experimental results are repeatable and reliable, those theories are accorded increasing degrees of certainty. One example of a theory that has acquired a very high degree of confidence in the scientific community is the assertion that the last few decades have been the warmest of the millennium in terms of global mean surface temperature. Sometimes referred to as the 'Hockey Stick Graph' as a way of describing the short, sharp rise in temperature, data supporting this theory goes back at least to Jacoby amp; D'Arrigo 1989 [1] but received an increased degree of public attention after the release of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Third Assessment Report in 2001, [2] which included a preliminary version of a Hockey Stick Graph reproducing the work of Mann, et al 1999 (MBH99). [3]What was MBH99? MBH99 was a study of 12 paleoclimatic indicators that illustrated a global pattern of annual surface temperature rise, demonstrating that temperatures over the previous decade were the highest of the millennium.What is the IPCC? The IPCC is a scientific body set up by the World Meteorological Organization and the UN in 1988 to provide comprehensive scientific assessments of current scientific information worldwide about the risk of climate change. Representing the consensus of 2500 unpaid leaders in the scientific community and 100 participating national governments, the IPCC is the single largest collective international scientific effort in history. The IPCC was awarded the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize 'for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change.' This is not to make an argument from authority or to pretend that IPCC findings are unimpeachable. However, if one wishes a careful and comprehensive summary of the scientific consensus, the IPCC is unmatched in the study of climate change, or indeed, by any other field of scientific study. Here is the IPCC Hockey Stick in 2001:Following the public attention given to the IPCC publication of the MBH99, there has more than a decade of reaction and response, including those studies provided by Con in his arguments. Many, many studies have expanded upon and, to a remarkable degree, supported the MBH99 Hockey Stick. When the IPCC released its Fourth Assessment Report in 2007, that body offered the following summary:'Paleoclimatic information supports the interpretation that the warmth of the last half century is unusual in at least the previous 1,300 years. The last time the polar regions were significantly warmer than present for an extended period (about 125,000 years ago), reductions in polar ice volume led to 4 to 6 m of sea level rise. Average Northern Hemisphere temperatures during the second half of the 20th century were very likely higher than during any other 50-year period in the last 500 years and likely the highest in at least the past 1,300 years. ' [4]We should note here that the AR4 assigns a probability to likely as greater than 66%.'the following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood, using expert judgement, of an outcome or a result: Virtually certain gt; 99% probability of occurrence, Extremely likely gt; 95%, Very likely gt; 90%, Likely gt; 66%, More likely than not gt; 50%, Unlikely lt; 33%, Very unlikely lt; 10%, Extremely unlikely lt; 5% ' [4]That is, the single most significant survey of scientific opinion up to 2007 asserted a 2:1 probability that the Hockey Stick was correct. To support these findings, the IPCC listed the following studies:  Jones et al. (1998), calibrated by Jones, Osborn amp; Briffa 2001 'The Evolution of Climate Over the Last Millennium' Briffa (2000), calibrated by Briffa, Osborn amp; Schweingruber 2004 'Large-scale temperature inferences from tree rings: a review' Crowley amp; Lowery 2000 'How Warm Was the Medieval Warm Period?' Briffa et al. 2001 'Low-frequency temperature variations from a northern tree ring density network' Esper, Cook amp; Schweingruber 2002 'Low-Frequency Signals in Long Tree-Ring Chronologies for Reconstructing Past Temperature Variability' Mann amp; Jones 2003 'Global surface temperatures over the past two millennia' Pollack amp; Smerdon 2004 'Borehole climate reconstructions: Spatial structure and hemispheric averages' Oerlemans 2005 'Extracting a climate signal from 169 glacier records' Rutherford et al. 2005 'Proxy-based Northern Hemisphere surface temperature reconstructions: Sensitivity to method, predictor network, target season, and target domain' Moberg et al. 2005 'Highly variable Northern Hemisphere temperatures reconstructed from low- and high-resolution proxy data' D'Arrigo, Wilson amp; Jacoby 2006 'On the long-term context for late twentieth century warming' Osborn amp; Briffa 2006 'The spatial extent of 20th-century warmth in the context of the past 1200 years' Hegerl et al. 2006 'Climate sensitivity constrained by temperature reconstructions over the past seven centuries'  And here those studies are graphed against MBH99:So we can see that most reconstructions since MBH have found the Medieval Warm Period to be even cooler than MBH99. None of these studies found that the MWP rivaled the last two decades for mean temperature increases.Since IPCC AR4 in 2007, there have been many more studies using increasingly large sampling sizes from increasingly disparate paleoclimatic indicators and geographies and going even further back in time. The more often the experiment is repeated, the more evident and less deniable the hockey stick becomes:  Smith et al. 2006 'Reconstructing hemispheric-scale climates from multiple stalagmite records'.

Marcott et al. 2013 'A Reconstruction of Regional and Global Temperature for the Past 11,300 Years' Ahmed et al. 2013 (PAGES 2k Consortium) 'Continental-scale temperature variability during the past two millennia'  As I stated in Round1 that last study, the PAGES 2K Consortium is the single most comprehensive study to date including 511 paleoclimatic indicators from around the world (see the map in Round1 and the graph substantiating MBH99).Here is Marcott's 2013 Hockey Stick compared to MBH99:CONCLUSION: Our confidence in any scientific proposition increases as experiments are reliably repeated with the same results. Since MBH99 and the IPCC Third Assessment, the theory that current global warming is unprecedented for at least a millennium has been supported by repeated, rigorous experimentation. To the degree that the IPCC represents the cautious consensus of Climate Change expertise and those experts have assigned a 66% probability to the data illustrated by the Hockey Stick Graph, the Hockey Stick is likely (greater than Con's defined 50%) correct.I'll offer rebuttals to Con's argument in Round 3.</t>

    <t>I forgot to say first round acceptance—that is my fault. I ask my opponent simply doesn’t post rebuttals last round, but he can summarize his arguments. Instead of a rebuttal I will simply write my case. The “issue” of the MWP Between 1995 and 2001, there was a complete revision on how the IPCC looked upon paleoclimate reconstructions. You could say there was a consensus—haha joke, funny. The MWP disappeared—it was considered a myth, a regional event, and modern warming was unprecedented. This change in views was influenced by one main graph: the hockey stick.   To understand the change in views, one has to look no further than the 1990 IPCC report. In 1990, the IPSS displayed the MWP as warmer than the current warm period, as well as a prominent little ice age (LIA). However in 2001, we see a steady decrease in temperatures—almost linear—and then exponential increase in temperatures near 1900. This was based on MBH 1998, 1999. Since then, debate has ensued whether or not these proxy studies are reliable. Criticism begins After the IPCC 2001 report, there was very little criticism of the MBH 1998 and 1999 reconstructions. Since 1999, it looked like smooth sailing for the hockey stick with official IPCC approval. But this began to change in 2003, when retired mineralogist Stephan McIntyre and Economist and statistical expert Ross McKitrick published criticism of the Mann reconstructions. The results of their study showed that the hockey stick curve happened as a result from poor data handling, obsolete data, and incorrect calculation of principal components [1]. Let me explain some terms. Principal components are, essentially, a weighted average of the original group series. These weights are chosen to maximize explained variance. MBH98 used these components to simplify both temperature and proxy data. Essentially, they shrink 1082 grid cells into 16 principal components. MBH98 described 112 proxies, 71 of which are individual and 31 are principal components computed from different networks of individual proxies, all of which contain more than three hundred original series. Mann never released how he calculated these, but 5 of the 6 of his groups were published in Nature through the Supplementary Information page. McKitrick and McIntyre both attempted to recalculate and reproduce Mann’s data. See, principal components only work when data was missing. Using the data directly from Nature and the IPCC, they found that a lot of data was missing. They attempted to contact Mann how he dealt with this issue—there was no response. After working long hours attempting to verify the tree ring data, they calculated the component value. They didn’t match Mann’s results. At all. After investigation of the errors, McIntyre and McKitrick (Mamp;M) found that Mann’s data suffered from large collated errors. McKitrick, after McIntyre sent him the data, found areas where one pair of series where two different columns had the same data for almost thirty years. After the research, Mamp;M found when odd data series—which had no place in the data set—were removed, the Hockey Stick chart disappeared. After the calculations, the MWP reappears and the 20th century isn’t so scary [2]. To further explain the issues Mamp;M found: “Almost all the NOAMER series selected for overweighting were of a single type and from a single researcher, Donald Graybill. The series were high-altitude bristlecone pine tree-ring chronologies… The sites were selected for “cambial dieback,” that is, the bark had died around most of the circumference of the tree. Graybill and Idso reported anomalously high twentieth-century growth for trees with cambial dieback, as compared with “full bark” trees at the same site.” (see [2], pg 41)  MBH98 recalculated looks like this:  As we can see, it was actually slightly warmer around 1400 than it was in 2000. Although the study doesn't measure anything previous to 1400, we see, at least, part of the MWP, and see that it is likely warmer than the 20th century. Indeed, what occurred was that Mann’s statistical techniques accidentally (as I presume no scientific malpractice was intended) weighted the trees with hockey stick shapes. This weighting was, in part, one of the large reasons why a hockey stick shape occurred. Spurious weighting amplified the warming result. In sum, the differences between Mamp;M and MBH98 are as follows: The cedar ring width series as well as principal component one—yes, these two things are the reason for the different results. For these data series, although Mann shrugs these changes as “conventional”, Mann changes his statistical techniques. The changes cause those datasets to be dominated by specific bristlecone pines which, as stated above, are anomalous. These pines are not considered good measurements of temperature. For a second dataset, the Cedar trees, Mann creates an extrapolation, unique to those 350 data series, and misrepresents the start date of the data series [3]. Yes, red noise an irregular statistical techniques always resulted in the hockey stick shape. Alternative reconstructions  Some reconstructions—who attempt to act as independent verification, but are part of the hockey team, have published reconstructions which purport to claim  “the 20th century is the most anomalous interval in the entire analysis period, with highly significant occurrences of positive anomalies and positive extremes in the proxy records.”[4] However, this view is challenged by the majority of the reconstructions published. Recent research using lake sediments in Europe have found that the MWP was likely 0.9 degrees C warmer than today. The study even comments on other literature, saying “several other reconstructions from the Northern Hemisphere also show [recent] warm inferred temperatures that were not as warm as the [MWP]”[5].   Other work, based in Russia however obtains data from elsewhere, relies on a vast array of proxies as well as historical evidence from writings. In many cases, the authors find that the MWP was warmer than the latter part of the 20th century. Furthermore, they find that the MWP and LIA was a global event—not a regional one as Mann and team espouse [6]. Work from the same year, by Esper et al. shows that the warming in the 20th century was not unprecedented at all—if anything, the MWP was slightly warmer than the modern warm period [7].   Graph from Esper et al. 2002.   Conclusion: I have presented evidence that: (1)    Early evidence opposes the Hockey Stick graph (2)    The Hockey Stick studies are flawed due to tree ring methodology (3)    New evidence, too, generally disconfirms the Hockey Stick graph     1.

To the limited degree by which the image of a hockey stick can approximate well-established recent changes in climate, the Hockey Stick is likely correct.I'll leave the body of my argument for Round2 after Con has had his chance, but we need to do some housekeeping regarding our shared assumptions.*****************I take exception to the proffered definition of the Hockey Stick Graph for 3 reasons:1) BIASED- When it comes to defining shared terminology, the offered definition should be as impartial as possible, preferably citing an objective source. Use of the word 'infamous' as the first adjective in Con's definition demonstrates significant bias. Here's a definition of the word infamous from Merriam-Webster'sin·fa·mousadjective \G2;in-fə-məs\1: having a reputation of the worst kind : notoriously evil  [2]If Con wishes to conclude that the graph is evil during the course of his arguments that's his prerogative. Obviously, we're not going to agree that the graph is evil as part of our common set of assumptions.2) INCOMPLETE- To simply attribute the graph to Mann et. all (MBH99) is to disregard the preponderance of data for which MBH99 is only an initial compilation. Dozens of subsequent studies have confirmed the 'hockey stick' geometry to greater or lesser degrees. 'Most later temperature reconstructions fall within the error bars of the original hockey stick. Some show far more variability leading up to the 20th century than the hockey stick, but none suggest that it has been warmer at any time in the past 1000 years than in the last part of the 20th century.' [3] *3) BURIED THE LEAD- Obviously, the defining element in any Hockey Stick graph is the post-1900 blade- the recent, sharp upturn. The point of the hockey stick is that temperatures have rapidly escalated over the 20th Century and have now achieved the high-water mark for the past millennium. Most hockey stick graphs document significant increases in variability correlating to older data, so the hockey stick has demonstrably less focus on subjects like the Medieval Warming Period (MWP) or the Little Ice Age (LIA) then on periods after recorded thermometer temperatures. To define the graph as primarily a description of the MWP or the LIA is misleading and ignores the central thesis of the hockey stick.We might also note that Con's definition is undermined by the Hockey Stick graph he provides. Con's definition states that the MWP is virtually non-existent and that there's no LIA, but both events are discernible in the Wikipedia graph and conveniently labeled.Therefore, allow me to offer a definition of Hockey Stick Graphs from Wikipedia, which should be more objective and complete than Con's personal definition of Hockey Stick Graphs.'Hockey stick graphs present the global or hemispherical mean temperature record of the past 500 to 2000 years as shown by quantitative climate reconstructions based on climate proxy records. These reconstructions have consistently shown a warming in the 20th century with the instrumental temperature record by 2000 exceeding earlier temperatures. The term hockey stick was coined by the climatologist Jerry Mahlman, to describe the pattern shown by the Mann, Bradley amp; Hughes 1999 (MBH99) reconstruction, envisaging a graph that is relatively flat to 1900 as forming an ice hockey stick's 'shaft', followed by a sharp increase corresponding to the 'blade'. The reconstructions have featured in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports as evidence of global warming. Arguments over the reconstructions have been taken up by fossil fuel industry funded lobbying groups attempting to cast doubt on climate science.' [4]*By way of example, here are a couple of additional graphs that qualify as Hockey Stick Graphs and which reinforce MBH99 data.Here's a graph from the a 2009 New Scientist article comparing 8 later which corroborate 2001 IPCC Hockey Stick (based on MBH99). Researchers from 24 countries spent seven years compiling data for the PAGES 2K project. They assembled 511 climate archives from around the world, from sediments, ice cores, tree rings, corals, stalagmites, pollen or historical documents and measurements to create the most comprehensive paleoclimate study yet.  Published this year in Nature Geosciences, this most recent and comprehensive analysis strongly corroborates the MBH99 Hockey Stick. Green dots are the 30-year average of the new PAGES 2K reconstruction. The red curve shows the global mean temperature. Blue is MBH99 with range of uncertainty.</t>

Further, the study also shows no Little Ice Age (LIA) in the data, either. Instead it shows a continually linear decreasing trend up until the mid 1800s, where the temperature increases.

We like trees around us because they make life more pleasant. Most of us respond to the presence of trees beyond simply observing their beauty. We feel serene, peaceful, restful, and tranquil in a grove of trees. We are 'at home' there. Hospital patients have been shown to recover from surgery more quickly when their hospital room offered a view of trees. The strong ties between people and trees are most evident in the resistance of community residents to removing trees to widen streets. Or we note the heroic efforts of individuals and organizations to save particularly large or historic trees in a community. The stature, strength, and endurance of trees give them a cathedral-like quality. Because of their potential for long life, trees frequently are planted as living memorials. We often become personally attached to trees that we or those we love have planted. This means that trees make us feel at peace during our time on earth and help us with particular things such as recovering from surgery. Trees are like to us our mothers when we were young and were sick.  Arbor 2,  Trees alter the environment in which we live by moderating climate, improving air quality, conserving water, and harboring wildlife. Climate control is obtained by moderating the effects of sun, wind, and rain. Radiant energy from the sun is absorbed or deflected by leaves on deciduous trees in the summer and is only filtered by branches of deciduous trees in winter. We are cooler when we stand in the shade of trees and are not exposed to direct sunlight. In winter, we value the sun's radiant energy. Therefore, we should plant only small or deciduous trees on the south side of homes. Wind speed and direction can be affected by trees. The more compact the foliage on the tree or group of trees, the greater the influence of the windbreak. The downward fall of rain, sleet, and hail is initially absorbed or deflected by trees, which provides some protection for people, pets, and buildings. Trees intercept water, store some of it, and reduce storm runoff and the possibility of flooding. Dew and frost are less common under trees because less radiant energy is released from the soil in those areas at night. Temperature in the vicinity of trees is cooler than that away from trees. The larger the tree, the greater the cooling. By using trees in the cities, we are able to moderate the heat-island effect caused by pavement and buildings in commercial areas. Air quality can be improved through the use of trees, shrubs, and turf. Leaves filter the air we breathe by removing dust and other particulates. Rain then washes the pollutants to the ground. Leaves absorb carbon dioxide from the air to form carbohydrates that are used in the plant's structure and function. In this process, leaves also absorb other air pollutants'such as ozone, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide'and give off oxygen. By planting trees and shrubs, we return to a more natural, less artificial environment. Birds and other wildlife are attracted to the area. The natural cycles of plant growth, reproduction, and decomposition are again present, both above and below ground. Natural harmony is restored to the urban environment. This means that trees offer many positive benefits to humans.  Epstein, Life on Earth depends on plants, algae and fungi. For humanity, all seven billion of us, they are the major source of food, clothing, shelter and medicine. Our fossil fuels were formed by them. They clean our air and water, store carbon, and protect us from floods and drought. This shows that humans cannot survive without the plants that make up our environment. Even drastically changing the amount of trees and plants that make up our environment can be fatal.  Marine Conservation Institute,  Because the oceans are the largest ecosystems on Earth, they are the Earth's largest life support systems. To survive and prosper, we all need healthy oceans. Oceans generate half of the oxygen people breathe. At any given moment, more than 97% of the world's water resides in oceans. Oceans provide a sixth of the animal protein people eat. They're the most promising source of new medicines to combat cancer, pain and bacterial diseases. Living oceans absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and reduce the impact of climate change  This shows that oceans are vital for humans to continue to live on Earth.  Thus, the standard is decreasing harmful resource production.  C1: Resource Extraction harms the Environment  NATURAL RESOURCE EXTRACTION HARMS THE ENVIRONMENT. Liam Downey [associate professor of sociology at the University of Colorado at Boulder], Eric Bonds [doctoral student at the University of Colorado at Boulder], and Katherine Clark [graduate student in environmental studies at the University of Colorado at Boulder], 'Natural Resource Extraction, Armed Violence, and Environmental Degradation', Organic Environ. 2010 December, vol. 23(4):417-445. Moreover, because natural resources are the ultimate source of all the energy and goods we produce, consume, and throw away, natural resource extraction harms the environment not only at the 'point of extraction' but globally as well. Thus, the grave environmental problems associated with industrial production and consumption (in both capitalist and noncapitalist societies) would not exist, or would not exist in their current form, if industrial societies were unable to efficiently extract and safely transport vast quantities of natural resources.  This shows that natural resource extraction harms our environment we live in and we must reduce or get rid of industries in their current system of extracting resources.  ENVIRONMENTAL DESTRUCTION CAUSES EXTINCTION  Anne Ehrlich amp; Paul Ehrlich, Professor of Biology and Senior Research Scientist at Stanford, 1/9/13 (Can a collapse of global civilization be avoided?,Proceedings of the Royal Society Biological Sciences, Proc. R. Soc. B 2013 280) But today, for the first time, humanity's global civilization'the worldwide, increasingly interconnected, highly technological society in which we all are to one degree or another, embedded'is threatened with collapse by an array of environmental problems. Humankind finds itself engaged in what Prince Charles described as 'an act of suicide on a grand scale' [4], facing what the UK's Chief Scientific Advisor John Beddington called a 'perfect storm' of environmental problems [5]. The most serious of these problems show signs of rapidly escalating severity, especially climate disruption. But other elements could potentially also contribute to a collapse: an accelerating extinction of animal and plant populations and species, which could lead to a loss of ecosystem services essential for human survival; land degradation and land-use change; a pole-to-pole spread of toxic compounds; ocean acidification and eutrophication (dead zones); worsening of some aspects of the epidemiological environment (factors that make human populations susceptible to infectious diseases); depletion of increasingly scarce resources [6,7], including especially groundwater, which is being overexploited in many key agricultural areas [8]; and resource wars [9]. These are not separate problems; rather they interact in two gigantic complex adaptive systems: the biosphere system and the human socio-economic system. The negative manifestations of these interactions are often referred to as 'the human predicament' [10], and determining how to prevent it from generating a global collapse is perhaps the foremost challenge confronting humanity. The human predicament is driven by overpopulation, overconsumption of natural resources and the use of unnecessarily environmentally damaging technologies and socio-economic-political arrangements to service Homo sapiens' aggregate consumption [11'17]. How far the human population size now is above the planet's long-term carrying capacity is suggested (conservatively) by ecological footprint analysis [18'20]. It shows that to support today's population of seven billion sustainably (i.e. with business as usual, including current technologies and standards of living) would require roughly half an additional planet; to do so, if all citizens of Earth consumed resources at the US level would take four to five more Earths. Adding the projected 2.5 billion more people by 2050 would make the human assault on civilization's life-support systems disproportionately worse, because almost everywhere people face systems with nonlinear responses [11,21'23], in which environmental damage increases at a rate that becomes faster with each additional person. Of course, the claim is often made that humanity will expand Earth's carrying capacity dramatically with technological innovation [24], but it is widely recognized that technologies can both add and subtract from carrying capacity. The plough evidently first expanded it and now appears to be reducing it [3]. Overall, careful analysis of the prospects does not provide much confidence that technology will save us [25] or that gross domestic product can be disengaged from resource use [26]  Since resource extraction is harming the environment, and if the environment keeps getting worse due to resource extraction, the human race may no longer exist. All plants and animals will be wiped out and oceans will be ruined. Also, many resources needed for human survival will disappear  C2: Resource Extraction harms oceans. OIL SPILLS WILL POLLUTE ENTIRE OCEANS Allen, 12 (Greg, NPR, 'U.S. Watches Closely As Oil Drilling Begins Off Cuba') There are big plans for oil exploration in the Caribbean, not far off the coast of Florida. A Spanish company recently began drilling in Cuban waters ' just 55 miles from Key West. The well is the first of several exploratory wells planned in Cuba and the Bahamas. The drilling has officials and researchers in Florida scrambling to make plans for how they'll respond in case of a spill. The U.S. currently doesn't allow any drilling for oil off its Atlantic coast or in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. One reason is what's at stake. Florida's tourism-based economy depends on its beaches, fishing and clear Caribbean water. Environmental Concerns The U.S. ban on drilling off of Florida, however, doesn't affect America's Caribbean neighbors. The exploratory well being drilled off of Cuba has many here concerned, including people like Richard Dodge. Dodge is the dean of Nova Southeastern University's Oceanographic Center in Dania Beach, near Fort Lauderdale, and what he's really concerned about is coral. At the school, Dodge and his graduate students raise staghorn coral in outdoor saltwater tanks. Live coral grow in the crystal-clear water, some just finger length. 'These are relatively new ones that we're starting out,' Dodge says. 'But over here, these are ones we'll be transplanting to the wild.' In another tank, large branches of coral will soon be used to help restore damaged reefs. Florida is home to more than three-quarters of the nation's coral reefs ' and they haven't been doing so well. Development and warming oceans have already weakened many. On a map, Dodge points out the location of what he believes is an even bigger potential threat ' the spot where Cuba has approved offshore oil drilling. 'The site that will be drilled,' he says, 'is only about 50 miles from Key West.' The rig drilling off Cuba's northern coast is operating in water that is more than a mile deep. But it's not the depth that concerns Dodge. In the case of a blowout, it's the operation's proximity to the Gulf Stream. 'We're worried that it could get into that stream fast and therefore, within days, impact our coastal ecosystem and coastline,' Dodge says. A spill could potentially affect hundreds of miles of beaches, mangroves and estuaries from the Keys to Palm Beach. Dodge and other marine scientists in Florida are asking the federal government to fund research that would help identify the resources most at risk, and develop guidelines to protect them. Embargo Could Complicate Cleanup Complicating matters is the fact that this new well is being drilled in the waters of a country that's under a strict U.S. embargo. Unless they apply for and receive special permission from the government, U.S. companies are banned from doing any work on the well ' even if there's a spill..  Oil is a natural resource, and this is one case in which people are worried that oil can ruin the oceans and the ecosystems that are very essential to Earth. And without these ecosystems from the ocean, the human race is in danger of extinction.</t>

    <t>I accept this debate.  I negate, Resolved: Developed countries should prioritize environmental protection over resource extraction when the two are in conflict. For clarification, I offer the following definitions: From Oxford Dictionary Prioritize- designate or treat as more important than other things From OECD Environmental protection- to maintain or restore the quality of the environment From Merriam- Webster Resource- a source of supply or support Extraction- the act or process of extracting something Observation 1: The Aff and the Neg must consider all types of resources in this round. Observation 2: The Aff must show that environmental protection doesn't require economic aid in order to win this round. The value for this round shall be country's framework. This shall be the value because a civilization cannot function properly without a good economy and austere social programs. This should be valued because it allows for developing countries to progress by having more and more in similar with developed countries. The criterion shall be strengthening a country's foundation. The criterion allows for the value of country's framework to be achieved because by strengthening the basic components of a country, we are creating a better framework for the developing countries to work on. Thus by strengthening a country's foundation, we can achieve the value of country's framework. CONTENTION 1: Economic development is necessary to solve many of the environmental issues of developing countries. Walter, Ugelow '79: 'The available evidence seems to suggest that environmental policy in developing countries remains comparatively permissive. The developing countries do have major environmental problems, but most of them are the product of poverty rather than affluence. Non-separation of storm and sanitary sewers and the use of open fires for cooking and heating, for example, serve to create environmental problems in developing country urban centers that rival the worst conditions in the advanced nations. Yet only economic growth can generate the real resources required to alleviate such conditions. This fact, together with myriad competing social needs far more pressing than pollution control, contributes to a generally permissive set of environmental attitudes in developing countries. Nevertheless, there is substantial variance among developing countries in environmental policy, partly because of differences in levels of development and partly because of differences in environmental preferences-and environmental attitudes have sometimes demonstrated rapid change. Past environmental 'disasters' like the dramatic losses in the Peruvian cotton crop after introduction of pesticides, the stripping of the Haitian mahogany forestand the ecological effects of the Aswan Dam in Egypt are not as likely to be repeated quite as readily in the future. In general, though, environmental constraints specifically in the extractive sector are not likely to serve as a major obstacle to growth of the industry.' Environmental protection is important; however, for developing countries to protect the environment, money is necessary and money comes from economic development. Resource extraction is a great contributor to helping the economy, thus resource extraction is needed in order to produce the money needed for protecting the environment. By creating a better economy, the developing countries will achieve the criterion of strengthening the country's foundation, therefore the value of country's framework is achieved.  CONTENTION 2: Economic growth is required to achieve environmental protection. Beckerman '92: 'The important environmental problems for the 75% of the world's population that live in developing countries are local problems of access to safe drinking water or decent sanitation, and urban degradation. Furthermore there is clear evidence that , although economic growth usually leads to environmental deterioration in the early stages of the process, in the end the best- and probably the only- way to attain a decent environment in most countries is to become rich.' This is a good time to go back to the old clich': the ends justify the means. A developing country can only protect the environment by spending money and resource extraction produces money. In the beginning, it may harm the environment, but in the end, enough money will be available to supply funds for environmental protection programs. Environmental protection shouldn't be prioritized over resource extraction because resource extraction is required for environmental protection to occur therefore resource extraction must come before protecting the environment. By growing the economy, a developing country can achieve the criterion of strengthening the country's foundation, therefore the value is achieved.  CONTENTION 3: Extracted renewable energy is correlated to less poverty, better health services, and improved education, such as cases in Sub- Saharan Africa. Kammen and Kirubi '08: 'After five decades of rural electrification, less than 5% of the rural population has access to the central grid in SSA, and new connections barely keep pace with population growth (TABLE 1). The patterns of regional energy production and consumption are far from uniform, however. North Africa is heavily dependent on oil and gas and the Republic of South Africa, on coal and nuclear power; in the rest of SSA, biomass (charcoal, fuelwood, dung, and crop residues) supplies 70%'' 90% of energy demand. The Republic of South Africa accounts for 50% of installed electricity generation on the continent. Moreover, energy use and energy investments SSA are clearly mismatched. Despite serving a minority, large-scale conventional energy sectors (electricity and petroleum) receive most energy investments. This is at the expense of the abundant, mature, and cost-effective small-scale renewable energy technologies, such as microhydro, solar energy, and improved biomass cookstoves. Many studies in SSA and elsewhere demonstrate strong empirical linkages between renewable energy technologies and a wide range of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, including reduced child and maternal mortality, poverty alleviation, improved education, and health services.' Extracted resources can help create better hospitals, better schools, and more jobs. Environmental protection may create more jobs but it spends more money than it can bring in and therefore cannot create better schools and hospitals. This is why environmental protection shouldn't be prioritized over resource extraction. Resource extraction has more benefits to a developing country than environmental protection does. In order to strengthen the country's foundation, its government must create better social services and create more jobs and this can be done better by resource extraction rather than environmental protection. By achieving the criterion we have achieved the value.  ATTACKS: The value: It is not moral to deny the citizens of a country better education, better hospitals, and more jobs in an excuse to protect the environment when resource extraction allows for all those benefits and in the end allows for environmental protection. Standard/Criterion: It states decreasing resource production; however, the con is extracting resources not producing resources, so the standard doesn't justify the prioritization of environmental protection over resource extraction. Also, when the aff's contentions don't decrease resource extraction but rather decrease resource production, the con's viewpoint remains untouched and the aff's arguments are atopical. Contention 1: 1)As I said in my case, resource extraction does harm the environment in the beginning, but in the end it allows for more environmental protection than could've been possible before and so the end justifies the means. 2)And are poor countries to stop developing their countries for their countries and therefore leave most of the citizens in poverty. This is not moral and therefore the aff doesn't acheive its value.3) I would like to say extinction is good and will offer the following arguments as to why: ' The version of progress enunciated in Hawking's story of cosmic colonisation presents a view whereby the solution to the negative consequences of technological action is to create new forms of technology, new forms of action.Does his mode of reflection pay enough attention to the irredeemable moments of destruction, harm, pain and suffering inflicted historically by human action upon the non-human world? There are, after all, a variety of negative consequences of human action, moments of destruction, moments of suffering, which may not be redeemable or ever made better.What we try to do paper is to draw out some of the consequences of reflecting more broadly upon the negative costs of human activity in the context of environmental catastrophe. This involves re-thinking a general idea of progress through the historical and conceptual lenses of speciesism the only appropriate moral response to a history of human destructive action is to give up our claims to biological supremacy and to sacrifice our form of life so as to give an eternal gift to others. From the outset it is important to make clear that the argument for the global suicide of humanity is presented as a thought experiment. The purpose of such a proposal in response to Hawking is to help show how a certain conception of modernity, of which his approach is representative, is problematic. Taking seriously the idea of global suicide is one way of throwing into question an ideology or dominant discourse of modernist-humanist action. [3] By imagining an alternative to the existing state of affairs, absurd as it may seem to some readers by its nihilistic and radical 'solution', we wish to open up a ground for a critical discussion of modernity and its negative impacts on both human an</t>

    <t>Round 3: Refutation of opponents argument 'This is a graph of CO2 concentrations and global temperature. If you look closely you can see that every time an ice age ends and the temperature starts rising CO2 levels lag behind a few hundred to thousands of years.'Point 1 Temperature and CO2 - Vostok ice-coreIn Con's graph associated with the above quoted text, what you actually see is Co2 levels increasing fairly consistently with a rise in temperature. However what you also see is the temperature dropping suddenly with a much greater lag in Co2 levels dropping that you see on the rising side of these peaks. If Co2 is the main contributing factor in global temperature, then how could the temperature drop thousands of years before the Co2 levels.Con's graph in this case actually serves to illustrate that Co2 levels are NOT the main contributing factor in global temperature. Point 2 The next graph provided by Con only covers the years between 1850 and 2013, We definitely see a rise in temperature along side the rise of Co2 levels, but what does this mean?In the previous graph which covers 450,000 years, we see the exact same relationship between Co2 and temperature. The only problem is that humans were not present in our current industrial state during the peak shown between 350,000-300,000, nor were we present during the peak between 250,000-200,000, and AGAIN we weren't present during the peak between 150,000-100,000! The only peak we are present for is the one between 50,000 and current, and this last peak looks identical to all the other peaks that have occurred during this ice age!The final graph provided by Con shows a speculative difference between our current measured temperature and then the 'blue line' shows what would have happened with 'NO HUMAN INFLUENCE'. This is pure speculation and has zero bearing on reality. Unless the creators of this graph have somehow managed to visit a parallel universe where Earth has no human inhabitants, this graph should be disregarded entirely because it is pure fiction.Lastly, Con provided a link to Perfluorotributylamine, this gas is extremely rare less than 1 part per trillion. precisely 0.18 parts per trillion, that is less than 2/10ths of 1 part per trillion. I can't even begin to explain how rare that is.This is a big part of the problem with Global warming science, many of these exaggerated claims like this last graph are based on nothing but speculation. They are based on a consensus which is fueled by our desire to 'Not break the planet' I understand this desire, there is no argument that pollution is good. But blaming naturally occurring events like interglacial periods on pollution isn't going to help us better understand our environment. If our Co2 centric models are actually the least accurate, then how can we expect speculative models like the 'NO HUMAN INFLUNCE' model to mean anything but 'PLEASE SUPPORT US EVEN THOUGH OUR SCIENCE IS WRONG'Consensus is only evoked when the science isn't strong enough.</t>

    <t>'In the previous graph which covers 450,000 years, we see the exact same relationship between Co2 and temperature' This statement is false. In the graph of graph of 450000 years and the graph of 1850-present the relationship between CO2 is different. What's different is that CO2 and temperature start rising simultaneously when before they didn't. It's also interesting to note that the'unimportant' perfluorotributylamine gas started to be produced in the Mid-20th century is only a decade or two off of the time when global temperatures started rising more drastically. The last peak is actually quite different. It shows that the temperature started to rise less rapidly and then it suddenly started rising at a much higher rate when you look at it closer up in the 2nd graph.'The final graph provided by Con shows a speculative difference between our current measured temperature and then the 'blue line' shows what would have happened with 'NO HUMAN INFLUENCE'.

    <t>Round 4: closing arguments amp; response to R3 refutations if you so desire.In my closing argument I would ask the readers to 'put aside' their preconceived conceptions of global warming as it has been told to us repeatedly and LOOK at the graphs that Con provided. Everyone can clearly see the same event repeating over and over again as we enter an interglacial period. A sudden rise in temperature and Co2 on each peak. Mankind was only here during the very last peak. Con argued that 'This statement is false' in round 3 but why is it false? we can all see the graph for ourselves.We can see that on each peak, The left side of the peak rises sharply, and then there is a much slower decent on the right. the temperature of the Earth on the left side of each peak rises sharply, then slowly descends back down into glacial periods.Just because we are measuring a rise in Co2 and the temperature, doesn't mean that correlation is causation. Correlation is not always causation.The 3rd Graph might be based on data from the biggest super computer the world has ever known, that doesn't change the fact that they are not observations of the REAL WORLD. Someone wrote those models to support their own theory, and all of our Co2 centric models FAILED to predict real world events. That is why the IPCC can not explain the 20 year pause in warming, That is why Germany wanted to DELETE the pause in global warming from the IPCC reports.'Germany called for the reference to the slowdown to be deleted, saying a time span of 10-15 years was misleading in the context of climate change'. </t>

    <t>Firstly I would like to thank Con for accepting this debate.Resolved: Ice Ages are real, we are currently in an interglacial period and the Earth will warm further with or without the influences of mankind.Ice Ages are real (I don't expect you to argue that ice ages are NOT real)The Earth has experienced five ice ages that we know of Huronian, Cryogenian, Andean-Saharan, Karoo Ice Age and the Quaternary glaciation.The current ice age that Earth is in is the Quaternary, within the Quaternary we are in an interglacial period known as the Holocene Epoch. 'The Holocene is a geologicalepoch which began at the end of the Pleistocene[1] (at 11,700 calendar years BP) [2] and continues to the present.' As you can see from the table ^ posted above, The earth has experienced temperatures far warmer than we currently are experiencing, and likewise has experienced temperatures far cooler than we are currently experiencing. And this is just in a relatively short period (geologically speaking) and within our current ice age.The Greenland ice sheet is thought to be fairly young, only to have formed in the Oligocene epoch, and most likely to have retreated and advanced many times. The beginning of this ice age is referred to as the time when permanent ice sheets were established on Greenland and Antarctica, thus the end of the last ice age was set by the absence of those permanent ice sheets.In summary, we know there have been five separate ice ages and within those ice ages there are multiple glacial and interglacial periods where these ice sheets have retreated and advanced.I contend that with all the geological evidence available to us, the Greenland ice sheets would retreat with or without the impact of humans. We may in fact be having an impact on glaciation, but regardless of that impact, glaciation would occur with or without us as it has for hundreds of millions of years.There are forces at work that affect our global climate far greater than the man made Co2 which is measure in ppm (parts per million)These forces include but are not limited to:Solar Output.</t>

    <t>This is a graph of CO2 concentrations and global temperature. If you look closely you can see that every time an ice age ends and the temperature starts rising CO2 levels lag behind a few hundred to thousands of years. This is a graph showing the same thing except for the years 1850-2000. At the year around 1975 a big change takes place in the way CO2 levels and temperature are related. Unlike in the past 400000 years where CO2 levels lagged behind temperature; starting around 1975 the CO2 levels rise almost Simultaneously. In the past 25 to 40 years there have been no worldwide effecting volcanoes, asteroids, or anything else that could cause that change the relationship between CO2 and temperature other than humans.Another element of evidence is that 'when climate model simulations of the last century include all of the major influences on climate, both human-induced and natural, they can reproduce many important features of observed climate change patterns. When human influences are removed from the model experiments, results suggest that the surface of the Earth would actually have cooled slightly over the last 50 years. The clear message from fingerprint studies is that the observed warming over the last half-century cannot be explained by natural factors, and is instead caused primarily by human factors. 'With this you don't even have to be a scientist to find that with no human influence it's incredibly different.Also even if CO2 isn't enough; scientists have found a new green house gas that produced by humans and is 7100 times stronger than Carbon Dioxide.</t>

    <t>Current weather modification programs should be banned because cloud seeding is a toxic, inadequate and unpredictable solution that may have disastrous consequences.  This debate is to help clear up the misconceptions about geo-engineering and weather modification (see last paragraph), and to call attention to the real problem: we are constantly, DELIBERATELY modifying the weather, and it's affecting the Earth's climate.  There are exceptions, but in general the artificial clouds formed by aircraft ('chemtrails') that we see are NOT from 'geo-engineering' programs. They are NOT from HAARP (suspicious as HAARP is, it does not create jet contrails, aircraft do). They are NOT from military experiments (though there are those). They are not intended to provide sunscreen (SRM) to reduce global warming (though that is proposed).  Artificial clouds formed by aircraft are PRIMARILY the result of the steam (super-heated water vapor) in the jet engine exhaust mixing with enough cloud condensation nuclei to form visible and persistent clouds. See reference [14] below.  The cloud condensation nuclei are MOSTLY water (relative humidity) in the form of tiny ice crystals (it's below zero up there) AND artificially-created nuclei. [4] This initial argument explains how it works, and why I think it's a very bad thing...  BACKGROUND 'Weather modification' is mostly cloud seeding for precipitation enhancement; that is, we seed clouds to bring more rain and snow to dry areas. (Other purposes are minor exceptions; e.g., breaking up hailstorms, a service insurance companies pay for.)  LOCAL governments globally (in at least 68 counties in 12 US states, and in about 50 other countries) hire weather modification companies to increase water supplies, and see this as a good value... 10 to 15% more precipitation at a much lower cost than other alternatives. [1] [12] This is important since nearly every large city in the world needs more water.  THE ARGUMENT While humans do need more water to avoid drought and starvation, weather modification (cloud seeding) is a terrible solution in a growing industry that has been underway for over half a century. [8] There are at least two huge problems with our current, ongoing weather modification programs:  1. We 'seed' clouds using extremely toxic flares (typically fixed to the wings of aircraft) [2] [7] that consist of silver iodide (Agl) and salt chemicals as well as strontium, aluminum, magnesium and other toxic chemicals. [13]  Millions of these flares are burned over our heads each year, dispersing invisible cloud condensation nuclei in front of and above the paths of incoming storms, most commonly at about 16,000 to 22,000 feet. [3] [4] [10] The resulting abundance of cloud condensation nuclei causes more and thicker clouds to produce more water.  Since these cloud condensation nuclei are aerosols (tiny particulates small enough to permeate a membrane), they cannot be contained and move up as well as down- anywhere the wind blows them. And because weather in the US tends to sweep across the states left-to-right... that is, eastward... when western states from California to Colorado seed the clouds with these metallic aerosols, they end up blowing across the entire country, enhancing cloud formation wherever they end up. And ultimately, of course, they end up in our soil, water and lungs.  And cloud seeding professionals cannot answer the obvious questions about their growing business: How many cloud seeding flares do we actually burn every year, and exactly how many would be a safe amount? [3] (Why would we ever think that burning these toxic metallic aerosols into our limited breathing space is a good idea?)  2. Water vapor injected into the atmosphere by aircraft fuel combustion (trillions of cubic feet added annually) bonds with these constantly-added CCNs to form artificial clouds. [10]  NASA tells us that the abundance and location of CLOUDS AFFECT THE CLIMATE MORE THAN CO2 OR OTHER GREENHOUSE GASES. [5]  Since we have been creating more and more persistent artificial clouds since the 1960s, we should be concerned with the worldwide scale on which this is now occurring. In fact, artificial clouds from aircraft ('chemtrails') were first reported by the DOT to the Department of Commerce in the 1970s, following which the US Congress declared 'inadvertent climate variation' to be a national security issue. That was in 1978, an important historical fact in analyzing current climate conditions on Earth. (You can use Google for more on this history.)  The constantly-increasing cloud condensation nuclei deliberately added to the atmosphere, combined with the increasing size and frequency of jet aircraft injecting more and more water vapor, results in more average global cloud cover. (Time-lapse documentation of this shows it clearly if you haven't seen this for yourself.) [11]  Why is that so important? If clouds affect the climate more than CO2, researchers should be aware that WE ARE MAKING CLOUDS and drastically affecting the abundance and location of global cloud cover. [9]  Unfortunately, climate researchers at large are unaware of our quiet but prolific deliberate weather modification activities. Even 'normal' cirrus clouds have at their nucleus 'mineral dust' and 'metallic aerosols'- the exact ingredients of cloud seeding flares. [4] Water vapor is a far more powerful 'greenhouse gas' than CO2, trapping and re-emitting heat. [15]  Clouds cool the ground during the day, but they also prevent heat from escaping at night, warming the air below. In other words, artificial clouds we are creating (jet condensation trails that persist and grow to form thick clouds) ARE AFFECTING THE CLIMATE. [11]  Remember: when we talk about 'climate change' we are referring to changes in WEATHER over time. Since we have been MODIFYING THE WEATHER in more and more locations, and with greater force of technology (and budget) every year for over half a century, we'd better look at this very critically. And scientifically.  And meanwhile, I think we should stop it.  IMPORTANT NOTE: Weather modification, which MOSTLY consists cloud seeding for precipitation enhancement, should not be confused with geo-engineering, which MOSTLY consists of proposed solar radiation management (SRM)- using sulfur dioxide, not cloud condensation chemicals.[6] SRM is a NEW idea proposed since the 1990s to counter global warming by reducing solar radiation, while cloud seeding with Agl started in the 1960s and has increased drastically every year, especially over the past 20 years.  If you want to debate me, please be sure to read through the documentation.</t>

    <t>On the topic of not underestimating the ecological crisis in comparison with the economic crisis.Firstly, I would like to point out the length of the ecological cris in comparison with the economic crisis. The existence of the ecological crisis is, ofcourse, commonly known. The latter applies to the economic crisis as well. Though, there is a significant difference in first noticeable negative change. The economic crisis started in the autumn of 2008 with the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers. The ecological crisis however is noticed much earlier. Being first of all initiated by the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain, the rise of Co2 in the atmosphere started rising, without stopping.(Note 1)In the following graph, the correlation between the rise in Co2 density and temperature rise can clearly be seen. This correlation is one of the fundamental dangers of the global warming. As recently pointed out by the IPCC (Note 3), the International Panel on Climate Change, this temperature rise is irreversibly caused by the human kind: 'Human influence on the climate system is clear. This is evident from the increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, positive radiative forcing, observed warming, and understanding of the climate system. ' (Note 4).(Note 2)To conclude, the ecological and economic crisis are evenly proven. Though, the ecological crisis is a much longer lingering problem, and should thus deserve more attention, concerning the more advanced stage the problem is in.Secondly, I'll mention the characteristics of the effects of both crises. When taking a look at the history, economic crises are common. Observe that the economic crises were always contested and overcome. This could be explained by the general incentive to develop a more sustainable economy. A period of welfare often follows upon an economic crisis, and vice versa. The traits of these cycle always differ, but are there.(Note 5)Notice that climate change is irreversible as stated in the IPCC document: 'Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen, and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased. '  (Note 4)This difference in the effects of the ecological and an economic crisis should be thoroughly considered when debating about this topic.Lastly, I would like to direct Con's attention to the following graph, where global economic growth of the past 2000 years. When you compare this graph with the former graphs, there is an obvious relation. The rise in economic welfare matches the trend in the earlier graphs. This indicates that the world financially corresponds with it's climate change. This correspondence can be explained by the general increase in world population, a result of the economic development, or for example by the rise in frequency of economic activity. Acknowledging that the ecological crisis is a forthcoming effect of the economical situation, one should always take the ecological status in mind when evaluating future development of the local or world economy. This implies that the ecological crisis should be considered when talking about the economic crisis. When combined with my first and second argument, my point that the ecological crisis should be higher prioritised than the economic crisis is logical.(Note 6).</t>

    <t>Here are my arguments for why I disagree with the statement that the ecological crisis, e.g. climate change, should be focused on more than the economic crisis.  First however, I would like to assert a few things. I do not disagree with the theory of global warming and I do not oppose taking actions. I am arguing that the economic crisis should take priority. Also, I will not be giving suggestions on how to address the economic crisis. For instance, stimulus bills, tax cuts, printing money, or any other actions a government may take to address an economic crisis. I will simply make the case that something along these lines should be done to address the economic crisis first. Lastly, while our economy is not necessarily good, the economic crisis is technically over so I will present my argument as being what should have been done in 2008 after the most recent economic crisis but as if that time was now.  With that being said, my first point is that the timing of the economic crisis is very short in comparison to the longer ecological crisis. There is much more time to fix the ecological crisis and it takes longer to address while an economic recovery can be done very quickly. That is why it is possible to solve both problems but to do this, the economic crisis must be addressed first. By using the methods I stated earlier, a speedy recovery can be made which will alleviate the pain of the economic crisis, and by doing so, it will open the door for a more meaningful approach to address climate change.  Using the following links, you will see that at the time of the economic crisis, government revenues dropped about as quickly as it's spending increased. Note how the revenue and spending changed around the time of the GDP changing. The significance of this is simple. The faster we fix the economic crisis, the faster revenue rises and spending goes down. With deficits down, there will be a greater willingness to spend additional funds on clean infrastructure, alternative energy, and investments in green technology research and development. This will be an even more efficient method of confronting climate change than in a slow recovery where the willingness to allocate additional funds to new green programs will not be present. A speedy recovery will quickly bring about this willingness and make a larger ecological impact in the long run.  At the same time, as this article shows. The economic costs of environmental regulations are significant, and for these to be put in place during an economic crisis would only exacerbate the problem. The positive impacts of these regulations are undeniable, but these should be implemented in a strong economy that is able to bear the burden of these regulations without jeapardizing our economy or economic recovery. That is why we should solve the economic problem first, because we can then move on to regulating the environment without causing a significant economic impact in a weak economy.  With these things being said, I will conclude by stating that while it is important to address the ecological crisis, it would be more prudent to solve the economic crisis first, before moving on to the ecological crisis. There is a huge amount of time before the full effects of climate change are upon us, while the economic crisis is here now. It should take priority.</t>

    <t>I made clear that my reason for not providing a suggested solution for the economic crisis is that that is another debate because there are so many options. However, it appears as if Pro would claim that my argument is invalid due to my not providing suggestions so I will elaborate more. There are numerous things the government and federal reserve can do to combat the effects of an economic crisis. First, a stimulus package of sorts that invests in infrastructure, education, AND some of the more minor environmental projects that can be put in place would make a positive impact on both crises while keeping the focus on the economic crisis. Second, governments can cut taxes in addition to stimulus in order to increase consumer spending. The Federal Reserve can do several things too. By keeping long term interest rates low, buying bonds in the process called quantitive easing, and lending to banks, the Fed can stimulate the credit market and get the economy going. These solutions have all been tried and have all shown some success. While there is debate over which of these to use, there are plenty of options that can be taken to promote growth. As for Pro's suggestion that growth must come by stimulating consumers. This is true of course, however, pro forgot to mention that all of the stimulus suggestions I made are designed to pump more money into the economy and into the wallets of consumers. Therefore, this argument is invalid.  Pro stated that the reason that my arguments are invalid is that they are based on uncertainty. This is not true. My arguments are based on the truth that there are steps that can be taken to stimulate growth. Even in the slowest recovery, the economy would still recover before the ecological crisis is upon us, and so my argument is not invalid or based on uncertainty. There is uncertainty in a recovery, but this uncertainty is based on how fast the economy will recover, not whether or not it will. The uncertainty is also mainly based on which recovery strategy is best, not based on if a specific strategy will help.  Whether a recovery is fast or slow, it will still be complete far before the ecological crisis is upon us. Because of this, I am baffled by pros suggestion that we should ignore the crisis that is already on us and instead focus on one that will not be fully felt for another half century or more. Yes, there are economically viable options that can and should be taken during a recovery, but these will not solve the entire problem. In order to fully solve the ecological crisis, there are many things that will have to be done including several things that would hinder a recovery. By solving the economic crisis using the methods I proposed, minor steps could be taken to fix the ecological crisis first, then when the economy is better, major actions must be taken to reverse the effects of climate change. This strategy allows us to fix both problems in a timely manner.  It is not a smart strategy to solve a distant ecological crisis instead of an economic crisis that is already here. The quickest and best method would solve both and it would involve addressing the economic issue first, and then the ecological issue second. This strategy solves both problems and it is clearly the most efficient strategy that could be taken.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank my opponent for his arguments and his first statement, which was really spot-on.Though, while reading his first argument, I couldn't agree with it. Con's statement that a economic crisis can be solved quicker than an ecological crisis is ofcourse valid. However, his solution for the economic crisis is unclear. I acknowledge that this debates isn't about the details of solving any of these two crises, but my point is this: as Con stated, many measures can be applied to possibly solve the economic crisis. While every economic crisis has different causes and effects, one can not rely on proposed solutions, hence the massive debates about the solutions for the economic crisis. And this is exactly the problem: for the economic crisis, one is not sure about the solutions; for the ecological crisis, solutions are reayd to be put in use. The point is that the governments need to adopt them. That being a side issue, if the governments put the economic crisis in front of the ecological crisis because it is possibly quicker to solve, this will only worsen the ecological crisis. The uncertainty is key for the economic crisis in contrary to the ecological crisis.Furthermore, on the topic of Con's second argument. I would like to notice Con on the fact that his second argument depends on his first argument: íf we fix the economic crisis, the measures mentioned in his second argument can used. This is, again, based on uncertainty. Directing to this article. The article states that the most useful thing one can do in times of uncertainty, is to be informed. That being said, the main area of the uncertainty in the economic crisis is the one of the customer. I believe that the economic crisis shouldn't be approached from a governments point of view, but from a customers. From this, one can conclude that the customers in fact are in the end the one to recreate or solve the economic crisis, whether or not supported by the government. To conclude, the uncertainty this argument is based on makes the argument almost invalid. For solving the uncertainty, this should not be by government spending or saving, but, as mentioned, but by stimulating the people/customers.Lastly, I would like to note that currently, enough ecologically safe options are available that are economically viable. Hydrogen engines in use for example do match their costs. The same goes for solar panels. The point is that as the technology improves, the viability to implement this in the current economic situation grows. This implies that solving the ecological crisis while being in a period of low economic activity is not only possible, but also economically interesting.Concluding, I believe that the arguments I put show that the ecological crisis is in fact the wiser option to choose when talking about priority. It is not only more urging to solve the ecological crisis in comparison with the economic crisis, but again, also economically doable. I hope Con agrees, and if not, I'm eager to see why in round #4.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank my opponent for his arguments. While going through his response, it seemed that some of his views were based on misapprehensions, which I would like to correct.First of all, Con suggests I disagree with his first argument because of him not elaborating enough on suggestions for solutions. I would like to repeat my last sentence from my first argument in Round #3: 'The uncertainty is key for the economic crisis in contrary to the ecological crisis.' By this, I meant that one can not be certain of effects of certain measures Con mentioned on the current economic crisis. That's the difference with applying measures for solving the ecological crisis: their outcome is certain in this current situation.Secondly, Con states that my argument of his argument being invalid because of uncertainty does not work out. In my second argument of Round #3, I believe I stressed enough that Cons second argument was based on the uncertain scenario of the economic crisis being solved, meaning his second argument is based on a presumption. I believe that the content of arguments should not be meant to be applied in a future moment, but in the present. The future is insecure, the present is not.Lastly, on his response to my first arguments. I'm of the opinion that Con responded insufficiently, taking my three arguments as a whole, and not responding directly to either of them.  Con states that the cological crisis is not yet upon us; I think I proved the opposite with, for example, the graphs and citations taken from Note 1, 2 and 4 in my arguments from Round #2. Furthermore, Con stated that my approach was to ignore the economic crisis. I think that I made clear in for example my last sentence, that I meant not to exclude the attention for one crisis from the other, but to prioritise the attention. I hope that Con can agree with me on the above. From my point of view, Con had not, in Round #3, adequately disproved my arguments from Round #2. For that reason, I suppose the outcome of the debate is for now, evident. As proposed, the ecological crisis should be prioritised above the economic crisis. I would like to thank my opponent for his debate so far. I await his entry for Round #4, and look forward to the Voting Period.</t>

    <t>First, I agree that there is some uncertainty in which methods will be effective, however, it is certain that the economy will eventually recover. It may be fast or slow but it will happen and so I disagree with Pro saying that when there is uncertainty in something then you should not do it.  Next, Pro suggests that I said that the ecological crisis is not here yet. That is not true, I said that the full effects of the ecological crisis are not yet here. Also, the reason I did not rebut Pro's first arguments was because they were not false. I clearly stated that I do not disagree that Climate change is coming and those arguments were proving that it was. Why would I rebut a statement that I agree with?  Finally, Pro never rebutted my argument that it is unwise to solve a problem that is already here as opposed to one that will not be fully felt for another half century or so. Millions of people are directly affected right now by the economic crisis and if we work to fix this problem now, we will be able to effectively combat the ecological crisis once the current suffering has been alleviated.  Throughout this debate, I have consistently proven why it is not a good idea to focus on the ecological crisis over the economic crisis and I hope that voters see this. Thank you.</t>

    <t>Utilitarianism is not a self-consistent moral system because utilitarianism is not moral in the first place. Since utilitarianism is doing the greater good for the greatest amount of people, we are forgetting about the minority. According to probe.org, ''utilitarianism cannot protect the rights of minorities if the goal is the greatest good for the greatest number. Americans in the eighteenth century could justify slavery on the basis that it provided a good consequence for a majority of Americans. Certainly the majority benefited from cheap slave labor even though the lives of black slaves were much worse.' Also, Adolf Hitler justified the Holocaust by using utilitarianism. He thought that in the end, the majority would be much happier once he had 'purified' the human race.  Utilitarianism cannot be self-consistent because morality is not constant. To be self-consistent, utilitarianism has to be constant. Situations are always changing and something that might have been moral once is not anymore. In different communities and areas of the world, morality is very different. In addition to that, morality varies from person to person.  Another reason why utilitarianism is not self-consistent is because it cannot uphold itself. Utilitarianism goes hand in hand with the quote 'the ends justify the means' and crumbles without it. Being self-consistent means to agree or be accordant with oneself but there are different types of utilitarianism, many of which disagree with each other. There is negative, act, rule, preference, and hedonistic utilitarianism. Negative utilitarianism is preventing the most harm from harming the most people while hedonistic util. is producing the most pleasure for the greatest number of people. Preventing harm and providing pleasure are completely separate things.  To go over my case one more time: 1 Util. is immoral  2 If morality is not constant, neither are the moral systems a) When situations change, morality does too b) Morality is different in different communities and areas of the world c) People have different opinions on what morality is  3 Util. is inconsistent a) Can't stand alone b) Different types disagree with each other</t>

    <t>'Europeans and Americans thought they were maximizing happiness for the Africans because 1) they thought they were already being overly kind to 'animals' and 2) the Africans were already being enslaved by other Africans and being a slave in Europe/America was much better than being a slave in Africa. Also, they were maximizing happiness for themselves because they could leave most of the hard work to the slaves. We know now that the Holocaust increased suffering, but Hitler and the majority of Germans believed they were maximizing happiness by ridding the world of lesser beings. So both these examples show the immorality of utilitarianism.'  You just completely ignored the definitions of 'moral system' I posted. And my opponent still continues not to explain how the Holocaust was 'minimizing suffering'. I also would argue that it is inaccurate to say that the reason these actions are immoral is not because of utilitarianism, but because of the inaccurate assumption that there are in fact 'higher' and 'lesser' people.  'The topic is 'Utilitarianism is a self-consistent moral system' but utilitarianism is not a moral system much less a self-consistent moral system. So although the debate is not about whether it is ideal or even good, whether it is moral or not must be involved for the debate to work. Again, the topic says 'Utilitarianism is a self-consistent MORAL system.' Utilitarianism cannot be a moral system if it is not moral.'  Yes, it can. I explained the definition of 'moral system' that I would be using in R1, yet you continue to ignore it. To reiterate: 'A system of ideas of right and wrong conduct; religious morality'  'Example: You are texting and driving and when you look up, you see five kids crossing the street in front of you. It is too late to stop so your only option is to swerve to the side but if you do you will hit one kid reading on the sidewalk. In this case, you only have to choices, hit five kids or one. Although it is neither choice is right, it is most likely that you will hit the kid on the sidewalk because you would be saving more lives.'  In a utilitarian mindset, yes.  Now let's change the situation. Instead of five kids crossing the street, there are felons and you are aware of that. Instead of child reading on a sidewalk, there is a well-known philanthropist checking the time so he doesn't see what is going on. Which would be moral? If you kill the philanthropist you will have saved five lives but the philanthropist is now no longer able to help more people in need. But if you kill the felons, you have no idea whether they have changed their ways or not. You may have destroyed five lives and families. In this case, neither choice is more moral than the other. You don't know which choice would bring greater happiness to more people and thus proving my point that morality is immeasurable and so are the moral systems.'  Here is the thing. If you change the premises, but keep the same fundamental logic, you are going to come to a different conclusion. Anyways, a system does not have to make a statement on absolutely everything to be self-consistent, unless you want to argue that climate change theory is inconsistent because it doesn't explain why gravity exists.  'Also, if something is meaningless without backup or examples, then I should win this debate because my opponent has no evidence, sources, or examples.'  BOP is on you, as I established in R1.  'This is unrelated to my point so this attack is void.'  It is not related, because both of the examples of subsections of utilitarianism only fulfill one criterion without consideration for the other.  'But if consistent means in agreement and not contradictory, the different kinds of utilitarianism must agree with each other to be consistent.'  This is not true. To apply this thinking to another situation: Say two people like cars, but one person likes Toyotas better than any other cars, and another person likes Hondas better than any other car. The two claims are inconsistent with each other, but the root idea of 'liking cars' is still SELF-consistent.  '3 Reliable; steady: Utilitarianism is not reliable or steady since the Holocaust, slavery, Stalin's genocides, and many more horrible things were justified using utilitarianism.'  These things can only be seen as utilitarian if one takes the view that there are in fact 'superior' or 'inferior' races (as the perpetrators did, but I do not, and I am sure my opponent does not either.)</t>

'I also would argue that it is inaccurate to say that the reason these actions are immoral is not because of utilitarianism, but because of the inaccurate assumption that there are in fact 'higher' and 'lesser' people.'  Hitler, although he was not a moral person, he was an amazing orator which is how he convinced many people that Jews were less than them. He justified himself by using utilitarianism. He convinced most of Germany that he would be increasing happiness and decreasing suffering by starting genocide against the Jews. Without utilitarianism, it would be much, much harder to persuade people to kill an entire race.  'Yes, it can. I explained the definition of 'moral system' that I would be using in R1, yet you continue to ignore it. To reiterate: 'A system of ideas of right and wrong conduct; religious morality'.'  If the definition was 'a system of ideas of right OR wrong conduct', then utilitarianism would be able to be a moral system without being moral. It would mean that a moral system could be a system of ideas of right conduct or a system of ideas of wrong conduct. But the definition is 'a system of ideas of right AND wrong conduct'. This means that a moral system is a system of ideas showing the difference between the right things we should do and the wrong things we should avoid. An immoral concept cannot be a system of ideas showing the difference between the right things we should do and the wrong things we should avoid if there is nothing right about it.  'Here is the thing. If you change the location, but keep the same basic logic, you are going to come to a different conclusion. Anyways, a system does not have to make a statement on absolutely everything to be self-consistent, unless you want to argue that climate change theory is inconsistent because it doesn't explain why gravity exists.'  I did not say that a system has to make a statement on absolutely everything; I just meant that morality is not constant since situations will change and there will not always be a choice that is more moral than the other or a choice that may have been moral before becomes immoral because of a change in situation.  'This is not true. To apply this thinking to another situation: Say two people like cars, but one person likes Toyotas better than any other cars, and another person likes Hondas better than any other car. The two claims are inconsistent with each other, but the root idea of 'liking cars' is still SELF-consistent.'  Utilitarianism is a completely separate idea than liking cars. Although two different claims of liking cars do not make the idea inconsistent, it does for utilitarianism because there is no root idea of utilitarianism. There is no such thing as 'just utilitarianism'. We are not even debating plain utilitarianism right now; based off the definition my opponent has provided for utilitarianism, we are debating about negative utilitarianism. If two different ideas of utilitarianism disagree with each other, it makes it inconsistent because there is no root idea.  'These things can only be seen as utilitarian if one takes the view that there are in fact 'superior' or 'inferior' races (as the perpetrators did, but I do not, and I am sure my opponent does not either.)'  Although, I do not believe in superior or inferior races and my opponent has made clear that he does not either, there are many people who believe so and like I stated before, a great orator, such as Hitler, can convince masses of people that there are higher and lesser people. There are many utilitarianistic extremists and they could start another genocide using utilitarianism as their foundation. So since there are still many racists in the world today ' some of who may be utilitarianistic extremists ' utilitarianism is not reliable or steady.</t>
<h>    To reiterate: 'A system of ideas of right and wrong conduct; religious morality'.'  If the definition was 'a system of ideas of right OR wrong conduct', then utilitarianism would be able to be a moral system without being moral.</h>

    <t>'I specified in my opening that when I said 'utilitarianism' I referred to maximizing happiness while also reducing suffering. Neither of the examples given minimizes suffering, rather, they increase it hugely.' Europeans and Americans thought they were maximizing happiness for the Africans because 1) they thought they were already being overly kind to 'animals' and 2) the Africans were already being enslaved by other Africans and being a slave in Europe/America was much better than being a slave in Africa. Also, they were maximizing happiness for themselves because they could leave most of the hard work to the slaves. We know now that the Holocaust increased suffering, but Hitler and the majority of Germans believed they were maximizing happiness by ridding the world of lesser beings. So both these examples show the immorality of utilitarianism.  'As I stated, this debate is not about whether utilitarianism is ideal or even good, but only whether it is consistent.' The topic is 'Utilitarianism is a self-consistent moral system' but utilitarianism is not a moral system much less a self-consistent moral system. So although the debate is not about whether it is ideal or even good, whether it is moral or not must be involved for the debate to work. Again, the topic says 'Utilitarianism is a self-consistent MORAL system.' Utilitarianism cannot be a moral system if it is not moral.  'To say something 'might' happen is meaningless without any kind of backup or examples, hypothetical or real.' Example: You are texting and driving and when you look up, you see five kids crossing the street in front of you. It is too late to stop so your only option is to swerve to the side but if you do you will hit one kid reading on the sidewalk. In this case, you only have to choices, hit five kids or one. Although it is neither choice is right, it is most likely that you will hit the kid on the sidewalk because you would be saving more lives. Now let's change the situation. Instead of five kids crossing the street, there are felons and you are aware of that. Instead of child reading on a sidewalk, there is a well-known philanthropist checking the time so he doesn't see what is going on. Which would be moral? If you kill the philanthropist you will have saved five lives but the philanthropist is now no longer able to help more people in need. But if you kill the felons, you have no idea whether they have changed their ways or not. You may have destroyed five lives and families. In this case, neither choice is more moral than the other. You don't know which choice would bring greater happiness to more people and thus proving my point that morality is immeasurable and so are the moral systems. Also, if something is meaningless without backup or examples, then I should win this debate because my opponent has no evidence, sources, or examples.  'Again, I stated in the opening that when I say 'utilitarianism' I refer to the idea that the most moral course of action is one that both reduces suffering and maximizes happiness to the greatest degree.' This is unrelated to my point so this attack is void.  Utilitarianism is inconsistent and I will prove that using each of these definitions from the freedictionary.com.  Consistent, n. 1 In agreement; compatible 2 Being in agreement with itself; coherent and uniform 3 Reliable; steady 4 Holding true as a group; not contradictory  1, 2, 4: So my opponent said, 'Anyways, two different philosophies that stem for the same idea disagreeing does not make the stem idea inconsistent with itself.' But if consistent means in agreement and not contradictory, the different kinds of utilitarianism must agree with each other to be consistent. 3 Reliable; steady: Utilitarianism is not reliable or steady since the Holocaust, slavery, Stalin's genocides, and many more horrible things were justified using utilitarianism.</t>

    <t>'Utilitarianism is not a self-consistent moral system because utilitarianism is not moral in the first place. Since utilitarianism is doing the greater good for the greatest amount of people, we are forgetting about the minority. According to probe.org, ''utilitarianism cannot protect the rights of minorities if the goal is the greatest good for the greatest number. Americans in the eighteenth century could justify slavery on the basis that it provided a good consequence for a majority of Americans. Certainly the majority benefited from cheap slave labor even though the lives of black slaves were much worse.' Also, Adolf Hitler justified the Holocaust by using utilitarianism. He thought that in the end, the majority would be much happier once he had 'purified' the human race.'  I specified in my opening that when I said 'utilitarianism' I referred to maximizing happiness while also reducing suffering. Neither of the examples given minimizes suffering, rather, they increase it hugely. Also:  moral system, n. 1. The quality of being in accord with standards of right or good conduct. 2. A system of ideas of right and wrong conduct: religious morality; Christian morality. 3. Virtuous conduct. 4. A rule or lesson in moral conduct.[1]  Here, I am referring to the second definition. As I stated, this debate is not about whether utilitarianism is ideal or even good, but only whether it is consistent.  'Utilitarianism cannot be self-consistent because morality is not constant. To be self-consistent, utilitarianism has to be constant. Situations are always changing and something that might have been moral once is not anymore. In different communities and areas of the world, morality is very different. In addition to that, morality varies from person to person.'  To say something 'might' happen is meaningless without any kind of backup or examples, hypothetical or real. And while it may be true that different people follow different rules, this does not make utilitarianism inconsistent.  'Another reason why utilitarianism is not self-consistent is because it cannot uphold itself. Utilitarianism goes hand in hand with the quote 'the ends justify the means' and crumbles without it. Being self-consistent means to agree or be accordant with oneself but there are different types of utilitarianism, many of which disagree with each other. There is negative, act, rule, preference, and hedonistic utilitarianism. Negative utilitarianism is preventing the most harm from harming the most people while hedonistic util. is producing the most pleasure for the greatest number of people. Preventing harm and providing pleasure are completely separate things.'  Again, I stated in the opening that when I say 'utilitarianism' I refer to the idea that the most moral course of action is one that both reduces suffering and maximizes happiness to the greatest degree. Anyways, two different philosophies that stem for the same idea disagreeing does not make the stem idea inconsistent with itself.</t>

    <t>'Jews, gays, disabled, etc. are not vermin.'  I do not believe they are vermin which is why I put the word vermin in quotation marks because that's what they believed back then. In fact, some people still believe they are.  'How does this relate to utilitarianism?'  This was just a lead in to the rest of the paragraph; it was never meant to be part of the debate.  'The majority of people being convinced of something does not make it true.'  Since the majority was convinced, it was maximizing happiness for them because they had fallen into a pit of believing they were higher than the Jews. Hitler's lies became their reality and even after Hitler died, some continued being cruel to 'lesser' races. Once enough people believe something, it can become true in our society.  'Yes, it can'  How?  'It just wouldn't be an accurate system of ideas.'  Exactly. If we attempt to follow an inaccurate system of ideas, we will be messed up.

'You are saying a moral system must make a statement even when neither choice is more moral than the other in order to maintain self-consistency.

    <t>Is there an environmental crisis in the US? My answer to that question is no. The affirmative side lacks the correct evidence to support this claim. Before we venture further in my constructive, we need to find out what a crisis is. The Noah Webster's dictionary defines crisis as, 'an unstable or crucial time or state of affairs in which a decisive change is impending.' Currently, unless I am incapable of thought, there is nothing horrible in which we need to make a decisive change. This is not just my personal conclusion, expert opinions and sources also support this conclusion. During the course of this paper, I will explain why there is no environmental crisis. To begin, I will discuss Alternative Energy and how the fuel we have right now is cleaner than ever. Then, I will discuss pollutants and how they are being controlled. Then I will conclude my constructive by reviewing the evidence. Fossil fuels are hydrocarbons primarily coal, natural gas and oil. These fuels are primarily formed from dead plants or animals over the course of thousands of years. Many environmentalists claim that fossil fuels will run out in the near future. They claim that we are consuming fossil fuels at such an alarming rate, that we will soon run out of them. Science contradicts, however. Based on a graph Professor H.D Maher Jr of the University of Omaha, the amount of oil has actually increased since 1994. It went from 539 billion barrels to 635 billion barrels. Also on the same graph, Natural Gas also went up from 90 BBE (Billion Barrel Equivalent) to 270 BBE. Clearly, we have not discovered all the oil and natural gas in the world; therefore we are not running out resources such as oil.  Many environmentalists claim that due to fossil fuels, the air is getting more polluted. However statistics disagree, 'In spite of the twentieth century's steep population rise, massive industrialization, and the nationwide proliferation of the modern automobile, the air we breathe is cleaner than it has been in decades. Data from the Environmental Protection Agency also confirm that U.S. air quality has improved since 1970,' according to Drew Thorley, writer for the Manhattan Institute. The EPA even agrees that the air we breathe is cleaner than before. What is up with the claims that emissions and air quality when statistics and the EPA clearly contradict? Even with this staggering evidence, Environmentalists claim that much of the technology that helps with pollution is very unstable. However many technologies involving coal, which is considered the dirtiest of all fossil fuels, are very stable and are actually helping coal greatly. Technologies such as Flue Gas Desulfurization and Low Nitrogen Oxide Burners are examples of this. The SO2, Sulfur Dioxide, removal performance of scrubbers has been reviewed. Data reflect that most wet limestone and LSD installations appear to be capable of ~90% SO2 removal. Advanced, state-of-the-art wet scrubbers can provide SO2 removal in excess of 95%... Low Nitrogen Oxide Burners reduce the creation of NOx, a cause of ground-level ozone, by restricting oxygen and manipulating the combustion process. Low NOx burners are now on 75 percent of existing coal power plants' says the NETL and NMA. These technologies are not only reliable; they are currently being used today. Petrogel, a technology developed by Dr. T.C. Chang, helps with pollution caused by oil spills. Here is how Dr. Chang described his technology, 'The difference with PETROGEL is its ability to absorb the oil, not the water, as well as more effectively release the recovered solid wastes. With PETROGEL, the resulting polyolefin/oil mixture can be treated as regular crude oil, suitable for the regular refining processes' There is no waste of natural resources and no pollution in the air or water' Not only does his technology help with oil recovery, it also conserves natural resources and adds no pollution in the air or water. Environmentalists claim renewable forms of energy such as solar, wind and geothermal energies are much better than fossil fuels. They also claim that not only are these energies unlimited, they also come with no repercussions whatsoever in the environment. Science once again contradicts. Solar energy has some very unique disadvantages. Charles Barnheart, lead author of the study at The University of Stanford's Global Climate and Energy Project, explains these costs. 'Batteries with high energetic cost consume more fossil fuels and therefore release more carbon dioxide over their lifetime. If a battery's energetic cost is too high, its overall contribution to global warming could negate the environmental benefits of the wind or solar farm it was supposed to support. Storing energy consumer's energy, and curtailing energy wastes it.' Not only are we wasting resources, the high-end batteries are consuming fossil fuels. The point comes back to the need of fossil fuels to power grids or power plants. The technologies to make solar power the primary source in which people gain power simply does not exist. Wind energy, which can technically function on its own, can be a hazard to avian animals. An environmentalist site by the University of Wisconsin supports this claim. 'Concerns are the avian and bat mortality. These creatures fly into the rotors of the turbines. Federally protected birds and bats near wind farms have raised awareness with the fish and wildlife agencies. Industries and their engineers have been busy however to improve these issues through more proper siting, insulated materials, and research on landscape and the organisms living there.' This can lead to extinction of these federally protected birds. Geothermal Energy Plants can cause earthquakes. Christopher Joyce of the NPR, National Public Radio, says that, 'A geothermal energy plant near the Salton Sea in California taps deep underground heat from the southern San Andreas Fault rift zone. A new study ties the amount of water pulled from the ground by the geothermal plant here to the frequency of earthquakes.' Therefore with these solid evidences I say that even renewable energies have its bad effects on the environment.</t>

    <t>Foreword to the Debate:Debates are both opportunities for idea sharing and competition. The competitive element of debate reinforces the desire of both parties to present well researched and logically sound analysis of controversial topics. We want to be 'right' about our ideas and views... but we also want to develop the ability to explain why we think the way that we do. Debate allows these ideas to compete in an objective forum. In this case, Con is not calmly stating a defensible argument. He is not making the case that, 'fears of a widespread environmental crisis are overblown,' or 'Many well-known environmental causes are misguided.' Instead, he is speaking in wild, angry extremes, and arguing that there are no negative environmental events happening anywhere in the US. The language that he is using is polemic, presenting an 'all or nothing' doctrine that is well known to students of debate as being impossible to defend. This position states that no 'horrible' environmental crises are happening at all... including naturally occurring ones that are not caused by human behavior, pollution or negligence. Even the infamous Koch Brothers would not go quite that far. The resolution is simply too broad and incautious to be defensible.   Is there an environmental crisis in the US? My answer to that question is no. The affirmative side lacks the correct evidence to support this claim.  The Noah Webster's dictionary defines crisis as, 'an unstable or crucial time or state of affairs in which a decisive change is impending.' Currently, unless I am incapable of thought, there is nothing horrible in which we need to make a decisive change.  He is saying that there are no environmental related crises anywhere in the US, because of air quality regulations by the EPA,  pollution capture safegaurds in the coal industry, and new oil discoveries. He also says that the flaws in electrical and geothermal power generation mean that there are no steps that we can take to keep our world clean. No endangered animals, no polluted waterways, no Superfund sites, no radioactive waste, no coastal erosion... and no natural events that negatively impact the environment, such as fire ants. Really? No environmental crises at all? He also suggests that the fuel that we are using is cleaner than it was during the Industrial Revolution. This fact, while reassuring, does not prevent wetland erosion from threatening New Orleans. It also does not replenish the honeybee population. At some point in the debate, Con will be required to admit that there exists somewhere a crisis that is harming something that is not man-made. There is a forest fire or flood somewhere, or a disease. He will have to admit that some animal somewhere is endangered, and should be protected. He will have to concede that oil is becoming more scarce in the US - and that deforestation is causing a loss of jobs. He will have to acknowledge that aquifers that provide drinking water to millions of Americans should not be jeopardized by toxic waste.  In short, Pro has taken on an impossible Burden of Proof in this debate. It cannot be argued convincingly that there are no environment related crises occurring in the US at all.</t>

Environmental Crises in the US The United States rests atop one of the most diverse ecological regions on the planet, and includes arctic tundra, mountains, plains, coastal regions, forests, swamps, deserts and dense urban areas.
There are several serious ecological disasters and crises that are currently underway in America, or that present a serious risk.
500 Mountains in America's Appalachians have been destroyed by Mountaintop Removal coal mining.
Google Maps Coordinates, showing deforestation' /gt;37.800832,-81.841133 Google Maps Coordinates, showing Massive deforestation Perhaps most horrifying, the human toll is almost unimaginable. We produce 17.28 metric tons of carbon emissions each year in the US.Con points out that many environmental protections have been implemented, and many successful strategies have been implemented to address the dangers caused by over-consumption and the use of fossil fuels. This political control has given rise to the astonishing practice of Mountaintop Removal coal mining. Each of these environments requires a delicate equilibrium in order to maintain it's continued existence, and many of them face unique challenges and potential crises. Overpopulation The US population crossed the 100 million mark as recently as 1915, and has tripled since then.
[8] I am sure that Con will deny that any of these environmental disasters are actually happening. This is Jarrell Cemetery, surrounded on all sides by mining operations. Unlike most European nations, the US population continues to grow rapidly, and will become unsustainable within 100 years, Carbon Emissions Although Con points to improvements in the amount of carbon emissions that are pumped into our air each year, the US remains the world largest polluter of carbon emissions.
Every other resident has been bought out by the coal company, Alpha Natural Resourses (formerly Massey Energy.
What is Mountaintop Removal?Put simply, Mountaintop Removal mining automates the process of coal mining, replacing workers with high explosives.
[4] Conservative estimates of the dollar cost related to premature Mountaintop Removal coal mining from all causes is $42 billion annually.
Roger and his mother Quinnie are the last remaining residents of Lindytown, West Virginia.
Several towns have been erased, and the coal industry is being wiped out - along with the careers and traditions that go along with it.
Above: Areas where Mountaintop Removal mining operations are occurring have the highest rates of cancer deaths in the entire United States.
Nevertheless, I will demonstrate that some environmental crises, some of them very serious, do in fact exist in the US. </t>

Please provide some links that will provide information on the number of vehicles per household in Nippon and Indonesia and the laws effect on traffic. I tried to find info and found none. So for now I will say that your claim is not accurate at best and a lie at worst. Since you have decided to make the debate more personal with name calling I choose to believe the latter until some evidence is provided.  I am sure that here in my home country of the United States that there are areas with greater numbers of vehicles per household yet less traffic than other areas with an opposite situation and effect. An example would be New York city (where many households only have 1 car if any) and any suburb of the same city (where there is on average several vehicles per household). Yet New York city has more traffic than the suburbs. I am providing no evidence but I trust the readers to know that this is true from their own life experience with any city vs suburb living.  Now I expect you to counter this with saying that people from the suburbs are entering the city in their vehicles and creating the traffic. Or, that there are greater numbers of people in the city...therefore more traffic even if they have less vehicles per household. If that is your response then I would say you are absolutely correct! This proves that number of vehicles per household is not a decisive factor in traffic that it is based on many variables and that your argument is simplistic and naive.  If your concern is the planet...and you feel like cars are the problem...then why not ban all vehicles? Or why limit by household? Why not limit by building? Such as each apartment building is allowed 1 vehicle for communal use. According to your logic this will reduce driving and therefore pollution.  On the pollution subject...do you have any data on how a car effects the environment? On how it contributes to global warming? If so please provide it. You may think it is common knowledge but if so then you should very easily be able to provide some facts.  I will say that if you eliminated all vehicles then the environmental damage would be even greater. As people lost the ability to transport themselves to central work locations then they would eventually resort back to a subsistence living of growing and raising their own food and burning wood to heat and cook with. This would lead to even more CO2 along with other particles released into the atmosphere. If you doubt me try this experiment. Cook a pot of rice in your home over a wood fire....then try cooking it over a gas or electric stove. You will find that the smoke from a wood stove will make your home nearly uninhabitable unless you vent the smoke to the outside. You will find that a gas or electric stove does not need to be vented unless you burn your food.  One last point. You mention traffic as if it is a bad thing. I think that is the initial thought of most people. They do not like traffic. I know I do not. However it is better than the alternative of no traffic. I know...that doesn't seem true or possible. But if it isn't the case then why do so many people suffer through it every day? They could simple stay at home and avoid traffic all together. Yet they do not...because they find it more rewarding to deal with it than any alternative that they have.</t>

    <t>Singapore does not limit the number of vehicles per household. They do have a rationing system however. Yet that is not what we are debating. We are debating if vehicles should be limited by household.  I maintain that it should not. I have stated previously that the number per household does not have any effect on traffic or the environment. You continue to maintain that it does. Yet your links embedded in your argument do not back this up. You continue to reference that it works in Japan yet still you provide no documentation (one link I had to sign in to see, I wasn't going to do that, if it was that one I am sorry). The link to Singapore discusses rationing but based on income not household.  I still maintain that the number per household does not effect the number on the road at any one time. I could give every person 10 vehicles yet each person can only drive 1 at a time. If a person has a need for vehicle transportation that doesn't change depending on how many are in each household, even if that number is zero...they will simply pay someone who has a vehicle to take them where they need to go. The miles driven may actually increase under that scenario.  I will freely admit that vehicles cause pollution but I also argue that the economic alternative to a petroleum based economy can result in greater pollution. Vehicles increase a person's economic opportunities, resulting in a greater standard of living, resulting in more wealth...and wealthy societies can more effectively fight pollution. If you doubt that take a look at wealthy cities verse poor cities throughout the world. And it isn't cheap transportation that makes societies poor...its expensive transportation and energy that makes a society poor, or at least some of the main factors.  The Pro has not proved how limiting vehicles PER HOUSEHOLD will help her concerns about traffic and the environment. I have even challenged that her concerns are a problem. Yet even if a voter finds her concerns valid and overriding then I still do not see how her proposal will alleviate those concerns.  Vote Con.</t>

    <t>That's so funny. You said that you only can drive a vihicle at one time. Of course that's right, but how about ur family? If the member of ur family is 4 - 6 members, does we need the vihicle in ur house until 4 - 6 vihicles? I totally disagree about that. The reason why I can say if we limit the number of vihicel in very household in a country, it can decrease the traffic jam in a country who legalize this programe. In Indonesia, Indonesia doesn't legalize this programme. And the capital city of Indonesia (Jakarta) from 24hours in a day, that 20hours there's happened the traffic jam and every household in Jakarta, they can have the vihicle 3 - 4 vihicles in every household. And because of this, Jakarta is the 1st rank as the biggest donatur of carbon dioxide in Indonesia. That's why, if we limit the number of vihicle in every household, not only decrease the posibility for the traffic jam but also decrease the number of carbon dioxide in the Air.  We know, Japan (Nippon) run this prgramme, and in Japan (Nippon) the traffic jam is so seldom. And why not we run this programme in every country in this world, so we can decrease the tic jam and can decrease the number of carbon dioxide in the air of this world and it's one step to avoid this world from global warming.

Traffic and global wraming are the only two from a lot of bad impact from the vihicle itself. The other bad impact, their country wil be so full because of this. And we know in every year, the number of citizen increase in every country, so their country will be full by the vihicle and the citizens.

    <t>Well, if you limit the number of vehicles per household you still do nothing to limit traffic. Each individual in the household that had somewhere to go before placing a limit on vehicles, still has someplace to go after limiting the vehicles. Someone will have to drive them. So, there is no change except life would be more complicated for members of a household.  I would also like to mention that it would punish larger households (such as ones with extended family or many kids) while single individuals would be able to drive as much as they wished. The limiting of vehicles per household would set off a chain of unintended consequences, such as people putting off marriage in an effort to avoid being without a vehicle.  If the limiting of vehicles will not change traffic then how would it affect the environment? I do not know that cars affect the environment but if they did your proposal still would not help.  It is very possible to be both for less traffic and a cleaner environment while seeing that your proposal will do neither...but the unintended consequences will be great. In addition it cannot be implemented in a fair manner.</t>

    <t>yes Good reason, no, simple, stupid, oversight. Design = creation. Accident = evolution. Reason.
So in fact I had actually written my round 3, simply neglected to actually submit it it. I talked about complexity of design, indicating design rather than accident, and therefore indicating a designer, someone who organised the appearance of everything we see.
I really don't see any way of making it more complex than that. I had I admit forgotten it in all that is happening in my life at the moment, but when I went to post my 'round 4' what did I find? I found the text below ready and waiting for me.
To me it is very simple, things either happen by accident, or they happen by design.
The Earth has undergone many cataclysmic changes in its history. Again, to me the way our Creator works is extremely logical.' Again I apologise for my oversight. This does backup the idea of diet triggering adaptation within a kind, or what was once referred to as a species before the meaning of the word species was expanded.
To me all of this helps prove the truth of Scripture, and therefore the creation account, which if true can also only be the most logical explanation of how we got here. Again I apologise. There are also, or have been, a number of theories of evolution, but the whole basis of evolution is that it simply happened will stop no creator, because that means God and most evolutionists will tell you that God doesn't exist, it just happened.Our highly intelligent designer, has as I said earlier simply employed a great economy of design.
And when you stop to think that one of the things which humanity shares many of its DNA characteristics with is a banana, all that demonstrates is intelligent economy of design. Of course there are various understandings of what creation means many of them depending on only a very brief reading of Genesis without any real consideration of what it is saying.</t>

    <t>Apology accepted, my friend! Let's debate!  My opponent essentially makes two arguments to support his position: 1) Evolution and life are too complex to have happened by mere chance and 2) Creationism (in the Bible) is logical as it fills in all the gaps that evolution leaves out.  First and foremost, my opponent's first argument does in fact do nothing to support his position. This is because: Even if evolution was wrong, that wouldn't make Creationism automatically right - there are more options. Correct version: If X (evolution) and Y (creationism in the Bible) exist. And X is wrong. Then Y is right. OK, but the reality is: X, Y, Z, A, B, C, D etc... exist. The lists for arguments for life go on and on, and on! Since we live in a reality where the second is more accurate and true, then even if X was wrong, Y isn't right. Thus, your position of Creationism is the most logical answer is not strengthened by flaws in evolution.  Having said that, I will still refute you. My opponent makes an appeal to ignorance (or at least appears to) in stating the evolution states that life, organisms etc... all came about my chance. The reality is almost opposite, although chance does play a part. The basic premise of evolution is: DNA can mutate - random and chance. But... The process of natural selection decides whether these gene mutations are useful to the organism and thus whether they should be kept. Natural selection is not chance, quite the opposite. With this, my opponent's objections to evolution crumbles, after this appeal to ignorance is revealed. However, I would still disagree with:  'How can a complete system like that have come about through random development? Simple it cannot have.'  even if it were true, because appeal to probability is another logical fallacy. But since this is not how evolution works, it does nothing to de-stabilize evolution.  I agree that Creation tell us X and Y, and Z did A and had the foresight to see B etc... That would be brilliant. But these are just claims and not supported by evidence. (If they are, my opponent has not shown any and the X is wrong therefore Y is right is invalid.) Not logical.  Now onto my contentions!  Contention 1:The distribution of fossils supports the Theory of Evolution. The Theory of Evolution predicts that as we move up the higher levels of strata, we should see more complex life forms fossilized, because animals will have evolved more over longer periods of time. However, the Argument for Creationism (should) predict that fossil distribution is random as bunnies were made with cyanobacteria which were made with mammoths which were made with homosapiens etc... OK, fair enough. But which does the evidence support? The Theory of Evolution. The fossil record shows the distribution as predicted by the theory of evolution. You never find mammoths with humans! I conclude that this fact (of the distribution) supports evolution.  Contention 2: Transitional forms support evolution. The Theory of Evolution predicts that because of random mutation and natural selection, we will see animals in transition from one form to another. We should see these in fossils. However, the argument for Creationism states that we shouldn't see any at all, because all animals were made how they are now. What do we see? Transitional forms, supporting evolution. 'From fish to amphibian: The fish Eusthenopteron and the early amphibian Icthyostega share so many characteristics as to constitute a virtual bridge between fishes and amphibians.' As an example. As I understand it, my opponent doesn't believe that we were all made in our current form (or kind, as my opponent calls it, though 'kind' isn't used in science) - so I am not using this against him. Instead, I am posting as a reference and to point this out to any other Creationists who disagree with my opponent. Contention 2 should not affect voting as it is not disproving Creationism as the definition agreed upon by myself and my opponent. Thank you.  These conclude my refutes and arguments. Thank you, I await my opponent's response.</t>

    <t>First may I apologise for taking so long to answer.  My argument is simple.  Evolution tries to teach that we came from a primordial soup of single celled organisms which changed and developed through a whole range of life-forms into what we are today.  When you consider the complexity which some organisms need to maintain in order to exist at all, one wonders where the logic lies in assuming that it all happened by accident.  Not only are so many of the creatures which we see around us, including some which are known not to have changed in millennia. Some are even called 'living fossils' because they are still precisely as they were when their ancestors were turning into fossils.  Watch some nature programs, or DVDs and what do you find? So frequently the presenter, scientist or whoever, speaks of design. Who can you have design in something which all happened by accident, by sheer chance? you cannot, for design you need a designer.  Another illogical element to evolutions as an explanation is the way in whihc so much of life on this planet is interdependent.  If it were not for insects, we would have very few plants, if it were not for Ramora, I wonder how well sharks would be able to hunt and eat with the tooth problems they would have, and those are just two simple examples, there are so many more, as ecologists are trying so hard to make us understand.  The interdependence is so great that our causing the extinction of so many species is threatening our own survival, and also affecting the weather patterns adversely.  How can a complete system like that have come about through random development?  Simple it cannot have.  Creation on the other hand tells us where everything came from and why, it gives us not only the origins of everything but the purpose of mankind.  It also shows that the creator had the intelligence to anticipate that the climate and other environmental circumstances, and build into his creation the ability to adapt to their surroundings and food sources.  The biggest example of that being that all of creation, including mankind was originally given fruit and vegetation as food, and yet, when it became necessary, after the flood those who needed to were able to adapt to a carnivorous diet.  Genesis 1:29, 30 'And God went on to say: 'Here I have given to YOU all vegetation bearing seed which is on the surface of the whole earth and every tree on which there is the fruit of a tree bearing seed. To YOU let it serve as food. 30 And to every wild beast of the earth and to every flying creature of the heavens and to everything moving upon the earth in which there is life as a soul I have given all green vegetation for food.' And it came to be so.'  The whole bible story simply expands on the marvellously intelligent working of the designer, and his amazing ability to plan, millennia ahead, and then make sure that his plans work out.  I look forward to seeing how my opponent counters the logic of these impressions of creation</t>

    <t>Design = creation.' Accident = evolution. 'To me it is very simple, things either happen by accident, or they happen by design. Allow me to narrow this down a bit further: '...design, indicating design'. I would ask my opponent to see my refute in round 2 to show this. My opponent, despite my refute in round 2 (which he appears to have ignored), is still making an appeal to ignorance fallacy by stating that evolution occurs through accident alone. My opponent's first statements are: 'I have to admit I am very curious to try and understand what alternatives there are in the creation versus evolution debate. Now, onto my opponent's arguments! 'I talked about complexity of design, indicating design rather than accident, and therefore indicating a designer, someone who organised the appearance of everything we see.'
In fact creationism makes no predictions whatever about the distribution of fossils.
The Theory of Evolution in itself doesn't try to explain where life came from, which is what [the ToE] I'm defending.
I thank my opponent for his arguments and apology; I accept the apology. My opponent appears to be saying that if DNA doesn't mutate then children cannot 'take place' [be born/conceived] because the DNA wouldn't be able to change.It does not. 'One thing my opponent appears to forget is that evolution is based on theories such as that expressed by Darwin which attempt to explain where life came from.'
It's satisfying to know that creation doesn't object to natural selection; but my opponent appears to be using this as proof for a Creator.
'The Earth has undergone many cataclysmic changes in its history.
'Creation, as described in Scripture merely explains the reason for that ability to adapt.'
For example, uranium decay, carbon dating, argon-argon dating, fission track dating helium, iodine-xenon, lanthanum-barium, lead-lead, neon-neon etc... 'Creation has no argument with DNA being able to adapt, though I do object to the use of the word mutate, because if DNA could not do that the birth of a child could never take place will stop since DNA changes every time a different type of cell needs to be formed to create that complex structure which is the human body.' I need not make a refute when no logical claim has been made. As he has not even attempted to refute it, merely ignore it; I extend my refute for that. It's true, however, that now the theory is being applied to try to explain how life originated (or 'came from', as my opponent puts it). This fits in with the geologically proved fact that the Earth was originally a single continent, and the geological layers were once flat, but are now tilted at various angles.
Creation has no argument with DNA being able to adapt, though I do object to the use of the word mutate, because if DNA could not do that [mutate, then] the birth of a child ((could never take place)) will stop since DNA changes every time a different type of cells needs to be formed to create that complex structure which is the human body.''
However, based on my round 2 and my opponents first claim, I need not do anything as it shouldn't affect the voting or debate in any way.
My point from round one, therefore, stands; that my opponent attempting to debunk evolution will not strengthen his position whatsoever.
So, this is like me making a fire truck that 'makes no predictions on how to tackle fires'. 'As for 'natural selection' creation has no objection to that either, because all [it] laterally describes is the process which the creator built into every creature to allow it to change to fit the circumstances it finds itself in. I need not refute this. ' </t>

    <t>I thank my opponent for his arguments, refutes, and closing statements. My final responses are below.  My opponent asks the question: 'Is the thought that evolution happens by accident alone a fallacy?' Yes. Please see my previous rounds. 'Certainly every theory of evolution I have ever read, and there have been a few, has denied any thought of design or deliberate direction, and that is largely because the minute you introduce deliberate design and / or direction you have creation.' I believe my opponent is clumping scientific theories with the more common use of the word. There is only one theory of evolution (that I'm aware of - and my opponent gives no reason for me to edit my belief in this), scientifically speaking. Other 'theories' (e.g., the 'Hovind Theory') are not scientific theories or, for that matter, scientific. They are, at best, hypotheses.  My opponent defends the idea of evolution being 'accident' by asserting that the process of natural selection is 'controlled only by the accident of the creatures being born into a particular set of circumstances.' I'll respond. a) Natural selection is its own master and is controlled by nothing - although its selecting process might be influenced by the organism's environment. b) It is not accident as much as chance. The two words have slightly different meanings - it's not an accident.  'We have a Universe which literally runs like clockwork, to the extent that NASA can predict years in advance when is the best time to launch a rocket to another planet.  Everything happens according to rigid laws. Did those laws simply evolve by accident or are the the product of a lawmaker?'  Laws do not 'evolve', as far as science can tell, laws of nature are the same, always were, and always will be. My opponent asserts that there must be a 'lawmaker' because there are 'laws'. Allow me to point out that the laws my opponent is referring to are called the 'laws of nature', so called because they are nature's laws - not made by anything (as far as the evidence suggests). So there is no need for a 'lawmaker'. 'Could that have happened by accident? I don;t think so.' I need not do anything here as my opponent confirms that this is just his opinion and nothing more. Opinion does not equal argument.  My opponent also suggests a sort of 'programmer' to account for the information 'programmed' into the DNA. Again, this just looks like an opinion, not an argument.  My opponent sums up the crux of his argument as follows: 'creation [is] far more logical than evolution since whilst creation gives us reasons for everything all evolution gives us is more questions.' Just because something gives us reasons doesn't make it logical. By that rather flawed logic, I can argue that because every religion gives us 'answers' then every religion is right. But they all contradict each other, outlining why 'it gives us answers' isn't the basis for an argument.  I thank my opponent, MadCornishBiker, for an entertaining and interesting debate. I accept my opponent's apology, don't worry about it! I also would like to thank the voters for taking the time to read this debate through.  Kind regards, J</t>

    <t>I did not exactly ignore my opponents refutation of the simplicity of the equations, but really there was nothing more to say to that.  Is the thought that evolution happens by accident alone a fallacy?  Certainly every theory of evolution I have ever read, and there have been a few, has denied any thought of design or deliberate direction, and that is largely because the minute you introduce deliberate design and / or direction you have creation.  Since most evolutionists deny the existence of God then there really is no alternative left. You either have a creation or you have simple accident and 'natural selection' which is controlled only by the accident of the creatures being born into a particular set of circumstances.  Creation means design, deliberate intention. Even the built in ability to adapt is deliberate.  But still, is creation the most logical answer? For that we have to look at much more than just animals, to everything in fact.  So what do we have?  We have a Universe which literally runs like clockwork, to the extent that NASA can predict years in advance when is the best time to launch a rocket to another planet.  Everything happens according to rigid laws. Did those laws simply evolve by accident or are the the product of a lawmaker?  As Ecologists are continually discovering to greater extents, this world is an ecostructure so man parts of which are interdependent. Could that have happened by accident? I don;t think so.  I do not see any relevance in what past cultures have believed, all that matters is what the observable evidence shows.  Not a bad interpretation of what I said but the point I was making is not that DNA mutates to allow for the changes in types of cells, but that it adapts according to a predetermined program built into it. Mutation is never beneficial, adaptation always is.  I admit I did not word that every well. I should have said that creation has no pick with what evolutionists call natural selection, simple as. My apologies for that, however it does not change my point . What evolution sees as natural selection is simply the ability to adapt to situations and circumstances to improve the chances of future generations. because it is designed in it is still natural selection, just not in the sense in which evolutionists mean it.  In a very real sense that is the crux of my argument, and to me it makes creation far more logical than evolution since whilst creation gives us reasons for everything all evolution gives us is more questions.  I thank my opponent for an interesting debate, and for the forgiveness of my error in missing round three, as well as for being gentleman enough not to take undue advantage of it.</t>

    <t>I will first address the issue of deforestation. My opponent states that we are taking out approximately 4.5 billion trees a year but at the same time replanting many of the trees we cut down. This does not account for the reported contribution to carbon dioxide emissions. According to (3), 'it is estimated that more than 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide are released to the atmosphere due to deforestation, mainly the cutting and burning of forests, every year.' In this same article, they also state that 30 million acres (121,406 square kilometers, 46,875 square miles) of forest are lost per year to deforestation. That would mean that not all of the forests we slash down are being replaced. The act of deforestation accounts for up to a third of the total anthropogenic carbon dioxide discharge according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC) (1). Another source that sites the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is (4). It states that approximately 1/4 of world greenhouse gas emissions come from tropical deforestation. This problem is worldwide. The effects of deforestation are due to not the replanting of the trees, but the removal of them, and in fact they do not contribute a large amount of oxygen to the atmosphere (2). The majority of O2 reserves produced by forests are used up by the creatures that inhabit them (2). I concede that due to the efforts we put towards reforestation, we help to mitigate the problems we are creating due to deforestation. These efforts only help in that they remove carbon from the atmosphere and mitigate the effects of the deforestation we are already committing. This does not stop us from committing the act of deforestation and it is still a problem that contributes to the effects of climate change (5). Global warming is the result of a rise in the average temperature of Earth's atmosphere since the late 19th century (6). The causes for global warming vary. My opponent states that global warming is a result of nature's contribution to Carbon Emissions and man has made insignificant contributions to the greenhouse effect. However, as (7) states, 'the global atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased from a pre-industrial value of about 280 ppm to 379 ppm in 2005. The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide in 2005 exceeds by far the natural range over the last 650,000 years (180 to 300 ppm) as determined from ice cores.' Even though we have taken measure to prevent the increase of greenhouse gases already present within the atmosphere, our contribution cannot be neglected. In (8) the graph shows the pre-1750 topospheric concentration of several gas compounds. It shows that in pre-industrial times many of the chemicals now in our atmosphere are due to man, not nature. These chemicals include many which were not around previous to the pre-1750s. In (9) a graph of the Glacial-Interglacial Ice Core Data is shown for the past 600,000 years. It shows that within the past 255 years the concentration of atmospheric CO2 has increased from 280 ppm to 379 ppm. While over the previous 8,000 years and before Industrialization in the 1750s, CO2 had only increased by 20 ppm. This can be shown in (9)(12) as well as the IPCCs fourth report. This almost certainly shows that man has had a significant impact on the increase of Carbon Dioxide emissions as well as other greenhouse gases(8)(10)(11, table 2.1). Now, my opponent has stated that the effects of mankind on the climate are negligible. The data above shows that this is not the case, and that Industrialization of nations is a direct cause to anthropocentric global warming. These are just the reasons for why man is one of the causes of global warming. There are also drastic consequences to the planet becoming warmer. These include various changes in weather such as an increasing amount of, 'irreversible dry-season rainfall reductions in several regions comparable to those of the 'dust bowl' era and inexorable sea level rise.' (13). This is just one of the results of abrupt climate change, as there are others. One of the problems that we face is pollution, which global warming contributes to (14). Pollution can be defined in this instance as the act of contaminating an environment with harmful or poisonous substances(15)(16)(17). There are many kinds of pollution and some of them are as follows: Air pollution, light pollution, soil contamination, and water pollution. The health effects of air pollution are egregious. Due to the insidious nature of many of the gases we release into the air through fuel consumption, industrial production, non-industrial sources, and transportation (18), we breath these in and they can have lasting health deficits for the living organisms of our planet. The top method in which particles are released into the air is through combustion. What is released in the air after this is not only water and carbon dioxide, but a host of other small particles and gases, include carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide (18)(19). These when breathed in have a wide range of negative health effects on human beings. The effect of particular matter including, ' (1) inhibiting and inactivating mucociliary streaming (2) killing or neutralizing alveolar macrophages (3) constricting airways (4) causing vasodilation and excess mucous secretion (5) causing changes in alveolar cell wall structure through abscesses and thickening which causes scar formation (6) traveling to other parts of the body, e.g., blood and heart.' (18). The dangers of Carbon Monoxide include poisoning and problems with the cardiovascular system (chronically). It is a result of emissions from fossil fuels and the burning of biomass. The impact of pollution on death is very serious, and strong correlations have been established between air pollution and death. In the Guardian, Professor George Knox wrote, 'Correlations with pneumonia deaths were exceptional. High mortality rates were observed in areas with elevated ambient pollution levels. The strongest side effect was an increase in pneumonia deaths.' (20). This is just an example of the many problems that can be associated with air pollution. Light pollution is another form of pollution that is a result of human activity. There are actual documented effects from that of increased lighting concerning its negative effects on animals, including humans. First and foremost, it is a use of energy to keep lights on at night. This is not only a waste of energy, but a misuse of it. When the energy consumption for lighting in the US is about 461 billion kWh in 2011 (21), it is no wonder you can see the lights very easily from the ISS(International Space Station) at night. To mention only the amount of energy we give to lighting would not do this topic justice, as there are adverse effects to lighting up the night sky. Not only does it prevent Astronomers from looking up and seeing the Milky Way, it also can have adverse effects on human and animal health and psychology (22)(23)(24)(25)(26)(27). There is evidence as late as December 2010 for light pollution increasing air pollution. Nitrate radical, which is destroyed by sunlight, is one of the chemicals in our atmosphere that breaks down smog and ozone. Due to the light energy emitted by Los Angeles, there are indications that there is a reduction in the amount of nitrate radical in the sky (28). Light pollution can also affect birds, sea turtles, and even salamanders (29). Light pollution is no joke and it is affecting our world. Soil contamination is when hazardous substances mix with the naturally occurring soil. It results when these hazardous materials are spilled or directly buried into the soil or move to the soil from a spill. Contaminants in the soil can hurt living organisms by coming into direct contact with the soil. For humans and animals they can also be exposed when they consume plants which have absorbed contaminants from their root (30). An index of all the various contaminants that can inhabit our soil is provided in (31). Many countries have their own criteria for soil contamination and often give values of the contaminants that are acceptable or that require immediate cleanup. For example, in China, soil contamination is a growing concern, and is only recently being addressed (32). Water Pollution is the result of natural bodies of water being contaminated by chemical, physical, radioactive or pathogenic microbial substances (33). Chemical water pollutants are atoms or molecules that have been distributed into naturally occurring bodies of water. Physical water pollutants are larger particles or physical factors such as temperature change, which can cause a variety of harmful effects (33). Common pathogens in natural water bodies are from untreated sewage and surface runoff from intensive livestock grazing (33). The problem with our food supply is not that of quantity, but of distribution. We have enough food to feed the world, yet they go unfed. This is a problem with the economic and political systems in place. This is a question of whether or not we can change our habits to fit the needs of the people worldwide. It is estimated that nearly 870 million people, or approximately 1/8 people, are chronically undernourished (34). Due to unequal income distribution and lack of resources, hunger prevails around the world. The World Bank estimated that 1.345 billion people live on $1.25 a day or less (34). In order to produce food, we need sound agricultural practices. These have gone out the window with modernization. There is a growing concern about the sustainability of the modern food production system 35). 'Evidence has accumulated showing that whereas the present capital- and technology-intensive farming systems have been extremely productive and competitive, they also bring a variety of economic, environmental, and social problems.' (35). I have more but there is a character limit I will comment with rest. =)</t>

    <t>Pro. The Rounds held a 10k limit. This is the highest I could set it, but is the limit none-the-less. It's poor conduct to post well beyond the limit, and into the Comment Section. I will reply to as much as the 10k Limit allows for.----------------------------------This does not account for the reported contribution to carbon dioxide emissions. According to (3), 'it is estimated that more than 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide are released to the atmosphere due to deforestation, mainly the cutting and burning of forests, every year.'1.5 billion tons of CO2 is only a number, not a statistic. By this, I mean it's meaningless. It equals only 1.5 gigatonnes.This makes up around 0.178% of all CO2 released into the atmosphere. This number is easily made up for by the current system, where (like in the US) Forests are getting larger, and are growing 42% larger than Harvest.(1)As we can see in the above image, while cutting down 2 trees make a one time deposit of 1,200 lb of CO2, the 3 tree replacing them will consume at least 12,600+ lbs in their lifespan. Your messurements on the number of forests lost only account for Deforestation, and doesn't take into account forest growth. It's simply a cherry picking. This can be seen in the US, where '215,200 hectacres are lost each year.'(3) The number's listed never account for regrowth, as again the US's forests are larger today than 100 years ago(2).3). The act of deforestation accounts for up to a third of the total anthropogenic carbon dioxide discharge according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC) Your sources is horribly wrong, as is your statistic.Human's release 29 gigatons of CO2 in the air. Around 3% of total emissions. Deforestation would make up only 5% of total Human Emissions, and again, only 0.178% of all emissions.(4) 4) The effects of deforestation are due to not the replanting of the trees, but the removal of them, and in fact they do not contribute a large amount of oxygen to the atmosphereOxygen has nothing to do with this...With forests larger today than 100 years ago, your argument is unwarranted. There are 400 billion trees in the world today,(5) If the US deforests 1 billion trees, and grow 1.5 billion, than after 50 years, the forests will be 25 billion trees larger. While 50 billion trees were removed, 75 billion were regrown. It's in investment profit, and the US's larger forests are a testiment to it's success.5). This does not stop us from committing the act of deforestation.In total, CO2 make's up a small portion of the Greenhouse Effect, with only a GWP multiplier of 1. Tree Deforestation's 1.5 gigatons of CO2 account for 0.0064%of the total Greenhouse Effect.(6)6) The act of Deforestation is not bad, nor a problem... It's only a problem if we aren't fixing it. I concede that due to the efforts we put towards reforestation, we help to mitigate the problems we are creating due to deforestation.case closed.Global warming is the result of a rise in the average temperature of Earth's atmosphere since the late 19th century.A total increase of 1.3*F.(7) With Human's making up around 0.28% of all the increased Greenhouse Effect, we are responsible for around 0.003*F. The difference in temperature from day to day across the year is larger. 7)the global atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased from a pre-industrial value of about 280 ppm to 379 ppm in 2005.That is irrelevant. Being the largest is as natural as being the smallest. We do in fact know that Nature can reach that high on it's own, therefore saying that it reaching that high makes it man-made is unwarranted. In the Mesozoic period, long before man, it reached 2000-4000 ppm.(8) 7000 ppm in the Cambrian Period. While this doesn't prove it's not man-made, it does make any claim that it's too big to be naturial unwarrented. 8) These chemicals include many which were not around previous to the pre-1750s.These man-made chemicals like CFCs make up around  0.072% of the total Greenhouse Effect. Equalling 0.00009*f increase.a graph of the Glacial-Interglacial Ice Core Data is shown for the past 600,000 years. It shows that within the past 255 years the concentration of atmospheric CO2 has increased from 280 ppm to 379 ppm.  You are bringing up simple numbers, but are not actually debating my argument with them. Increase and Descrease in ppm occurs all the time, naturally. Looking at the chart shown in R2, you will see how naturally the rate at which ppm increases and decreases changes on a regular basis. Just because it started changing 255 years ago does not mean it is man-made.Now, my opponent has stated that the effects of mankind on the climate are negligible. The data above shows that this is not the case, and that Industrialization of nations is a direct cause to anthropocentric global warming.The data above shows nothing more than how climate is changing, as it always has. The above data only makes assumptions about human involvement. No hard data specifically links human's to it.The data only says that climate is changing and human's exist, a case of Post Hoc. Throughout Human's existance, temperature and CO2 have risen and fallen, as is seen in the Roman Warming and Mineon Warming and the Little Ice Age. While they were not as large of an increase as the current, we have been through 3-4 warming periods, one is going to be larger than the others.These are just the reasons for why man is one of the causes of global warming. Are only reason's you think... Claiming an assumption to be fact is terrible debating. One of the problems that we face is pollution, which global warming contributes to. I will now show you the hard data... The first chart shows the percent of the Greenhouse Gas (with GWP multiplier added in, and baselines measured) while that second chart shows the percent of each that human's cause.GWP Multipliers are as follow...Water Vapor = 0.25CO2 = 1Methane = 21N2O = 310Misc = Depends. 9) The health effects of air pollution are egregious.People's health today is of far higher quality than any prior year. Despite Obesity, the overall Health of the world is growing year by year. In fact, obesity rates amoung children are dropping(10). Health is not a problem. 10) Soil contamination is when hazardous substances mix with the naturally occurring soil.Both Government and Large Companies use tactics for fixing soil and keeping land usable. This isn't an issue.and is only recently being addressed Therefore it's not a problem. Overpopulation implies we have grown to the point where we can not fix our negative influence.This also applies to Global Warming. If Global Warming is completely man-made, than it still doesn't prove we have begun Overpopulating because Global Warming is easily fixed.This also Applies to Water Population.The Pro must prove we have, without a doubt, begun Overpopulation and can no longer fix our negative influence. If we can fix our influence, than we haven't begun Overpopulating, we've just become wasteful.The problem with our food supply is not that of quantity, but of distribution.This does not imply Overpopulation. It implies we don't like sharing... If the World can no longer feed everyone, we have begun overpopulating it... It can still feed us... At most, it can feed over 36 billion people.The Resolution is that we have begun Overpopulation, not that we've became a greedy culture.It is estimated that nearly 870 million people, or approximately 1/8 people, are chronically undernourished The Pro, like so many, through around numbers, but not data. Is 870 million bad? Yes, but the number isn't relevant, the percent is. Since 1990, the population has increased by 1.8 billion, the number of hungry has decreased by 130 million.(11,12)The percent of hungry has decreased greatly over time, a sign that we are becoming a better species, not that we are overpopulating. The rest of the Pro's argument falls into the prior statements.The World Bank estimated that 1.345 billion people live on $1.25 a day or less (34).This is irrelevant to Overpopulation. The Pro is only bringing up typical social issues, not Overpopulation issues. The Mideval Times saw a tiny population around 200 million, and they had far worse unemployeement and pay. Same in the Roman Period. Social Issue =/= Overpopulation.The average person eats 2 lbs of food a day.It'll take half the food we are already producing to feed everyone adaquately. This is only a portion of what we can produce.The Pro has spent over 10,000 characters listing off fixable problems, miusreprented numbers, and irrelevant issues. Unemployeement, Low pay, Underfed... These are social issues, and they have been decreasing for centuries. While population increases, quality of life (food, paycheck, etc...) increase, and social issues (hunger, unemployeement, poor wealth) have decreased over time.With this, I conclude that not only have we not Overpopulating the world, but that we are growing as a civilization able to grow much, much bigger.I pass it on to Pro.</t>

    <t>Is Deforestation really a problem? This means that the forest population could last around 88.8 years.
The UN now plants 1.7 billion trees a year 12 billion total. According to NASA, there are 400 billion trees in the world.
Deforestation would be a problem if it weren't being solved, but it is.The world deforests what amounts to 4.5 billion trees a year (I averaged between 3-6 billion. According to the UNEP Billion Trees Program, all the trees grown under the UN program equaled 2 billion in 18 months after launch. If you leave out Water Vapor.Does Water Vapor really effect Global Warming?
We are in the Global Warming period of the cycle. You see, Urbanized areas (Cities, Towns, Villages) take up 3% of Earth's land...(12,13) If all of the Urban Areas was, by some odd chance, on Arable land, it would cover 28.76% of all Arable Land. Human's responsible for 3.6% of all CO2 emissions. Total number of plants planted would include this amount + all the other Replacement programs.
Argument starts now.-Deforestation.Deforestation verb: To cut down and clear away the trees or forests from. What defines a problem is that it can't, or isn't, being solved. Most companies that deforest have a Replacement Program, obviously they aim to keep their product growing.
After adding this gas in, with it's tiny GWP, it has a maasive effect on human's total effect on the Greenhouse Effect.How much?
The US alone plants 1.5 billion trees a year from nurseries alone.
This number also does not include the trees regrown in corporate Replacement programs, or volunteer programs.

    <t>Lets define Overpopulation.over'pop'u'la'tion noun: the condition of having a population so dense as to cause environmental deterioration, an impaired quality of life, or a population crash(1): Excessive population of an area to the point of overcrowding, depletion of natural resources, or environmental deterioration.(2): to fill with an excessive number of people, straining available resources and facilities: Now the generally shared issue listed is Population Damage and Environmental Damage.The world has seen overpopulation in terms of impaired quality of life many times, and the human race simply adapts and moves on. Are we too populated for our own quality of life? Lets do the math. New York City's population density is 27,550/sq mi.(4) I suppose you could say it's comfortable there. Very comfortable for some. The World's population is 7,101,513,000.(5)7,101,513,000 / 27,550/sq mi. = 257,768 sq mi.Texas size = 268,581 sq mi. With the whole worlds population fitting nicely in less a space than Texas, comfortably none-the-less, it's safe to say that overpopulation hasn't yet occurred in terms of quality of life.Now lets discuss Environmental Deterioration. Hmmm Lets think... Trees! Deforestation is a major concern, right? Wrong.The world deforests what amounts to 4.5 billion trees a year (I averaged between 3-6 billion.)(7) According to NASA, there are 400 billion trees in the world.(8) This means that the forest population could last around 88.8 years. That doesn't sound very long, does it? Think again. Actual deforestation estimates don't include the number of trees replanted. The US alone plants 1.5 billion trees a year from nurseries alone.(9) This alone increases the forest lifespan to 133.3 years. If the rest of the world planted 1/20th that amount per person, we'd be replanting enough trees to make the forest last 326.5 years. That's a little better. How many trees does the world grow, though? Well it's hard to tell. With Europe and (yes, shockingly) China, the number is far from small. This number also does not include the trees regrown in corporate Replacement programs, or volunteer programs. According to the UNEP Billion Trees Program, all the trees grown under the UN program equaled 2 billion in 18 months after launch.(10) If it kept up like that, we would see the program produce 1.33 billion trees a year. Has it kept up with that number? No. It's increased. The UN now plants 1.7 billion trees a year (12 billion total.) Between the UNEP program, and the US Nurseries, we replant 3.2 billion trees. Total number of plants planted would include this amount + all the other Replacement programs. Most companies that deforest have a Replacement Program, obviously they aim to keep their product growing. It also does not account for the trees that grow naturally on their own.How many trees do we think are grown each year, compared to the number of trees lost? Ask the US, whose forests are larger today than they were 100 years ago (when industry and war led the nation.)(12) The US's forest growth is 42% larger than it's forest harvesting. But what about Global Warming? Not an issue. The world as always gotten hotter for short periods. It's a natural process that helps burn up and refresh the world. I don't mean get rid of people or cities like in the movie 2012. I mean it helps to start Wild Fires and melt the ice caps a little. A very natural process. This time around, the warming process is hotter than ever before, not to be confused with being overly hot. Why is it hotter? Because of Humans? No. Humans mostly contribute to the greenhouse gases by adding in Carbon Dioxide. Humans only make up 5.53% of all the greenhouse gases.Well, actually. One thing everyone leaves out is Water Vapor. Gases don't have to be filthy in appearance to be a greenhouse gas. Water Vapor is the largest greenhouse, making up 95% of all the gases in the sky. With this added, Humans only make up 0.28% of all Global Warming. So what is causing this global warming to be worse than prior global warming? A growing Earth in general. All populations are growing, not necessary because of people. Global Warming this time around still is not hot enough to do harm, and if it were, it still wouldn't be because of the Human Population.But what about the Polar Ice Caps? What about them? They aren't really melting. Global Warming fanatics love to post pictures of the Ice Caps melting, but never speak of the ice cap growth. All ice melts over time, and it's only natural the Ice Caps melt to refresh the water and even the ice itself. For every bit of ice that melt, more takes it's place. The Ice Caps melt in the summer and grow in the winter.The Ice Caps have been growing, but for how long? All 33 years we've been studying them.(15) This mean they were growing when the Global Warning fanatics were just being born, and have been growing the whole time they've been shouting at us. Since we started viewing them, they've been growing, and have likely been growing long before. They have grown 26% since 2007. So while there is Global Warming, it's both natural and temporary, and is only slightly worse now than it was back then. Global Warming is, also, highly unaffected by Human activities, who only affect 0.28% of all greenhouse gases. The Ice Caps aren't getting smaller, and we aren't taking up nearly that much space. With so little negative affects on the world, Humans have yet to overpopulate. The Resolution is that Overpopulation is a current issue, but it isn't.When do humans start to overpopulate? When they can not prevent the negative effect we have. Tearing down 4.5 billion tree a year is a negative effect, but we can and are preventing it's effect with our own programs. If we get to a point where we can't undo our annual impact (which is very small right now) and the impact left over after all our attempts are (more than damaging) deadly to the Earth, than we are overpopulated.As of right now, the Resolution does not hold up. Right now, Overpopulation is not a concern.</t>
<h>    Global Warming this time around still is not hot enough to do harm, and if it were, it still wouldn't be because of the Human Population.But what about the Polar Ice Caps?</h>

    <t>A FF, I shall carry on with another set of arguments for fun!Food Supply.If everyone ate around average (2lb a day) than it would take 2,584,400,000 tons to feed them.That's good, because the world produces up to 4,000,000,000 tons of food. We could feed 11,000,000,000 people. The UN doesn't think we'll reach that many by the end of TWO century from now (start of 2300). (b) This is good because you can feed that many people with just the land we are using for farms. Another good thing is that most city and town expansions do not intrude on the farm land we use. Most farmers in the world aren't using up-to-date technology either. The UN's High Estimate is merely an extreme assumption. They stick with the Medium Assumption.It's important to remember that as population grows, so does farming technology and the number of farmers.ANOTHER factor... Arable Land.They believe 10.43% of all land is Arable.(c) Of all that land, they estimate only 37.5% of all Arable land is being used.(d) This means we could increase our population to 266.6% before needing a new way of farming (or better Technology, you have to remember that as time goes by, and number of people one acre can feed increases.) This is assuming we still throw away half our food. If we stopped throwing away so much food, we could increase our population to 514%. Of course some of that land is likely being used. No more than 30%. You see, Urbanized areas (Cities, Towns, Villages) take up 3% of Earth's land...(e,f) If all of the Urban Areas was, by some odd chance, on Arable land, it would cover 28.76% of all Arable Land. Leaving 33.74% left open. This means you could still almost double the population (assuming technology doesn't increase and Urbanization growth doesn't take up more Arable land.) Of course it's highly unlikely urban areas take up that much Arable Land. In fact, the 10.43% of the land that's Arable might exclude urban land, but I'm not sure. To put this into realization for you... Off of open Arable Land, we could hold a population from... (I'm posting the year the UN's High Estimate believe we will reach this number.)2175 = 18,888,660,000 (if we wasted half of our food still.)2300 = 36,538,000,000 (if we used all our food by then)Again, the dates are based on UN High Estimate, and the population is assuming we are using the same technology. It also assumes the same portion of Farmers are using up-to-date technology. Under the UN's actual estimate, we won't reach that number until LONG after 2300, if ever.By the way, some say it would take 10 earth's to sustain life if everyone were like Americans. I did the math... It'd take us not throwing away half our food, and increasing farming to 140%. Does that seem like a lot? To an extant... But that increase would leave Earth with 47.5% of it's Arable land left. That is far from needing 10 Earths... In fact, if each earth had the same amount of Arable land, it'd take 4.75% of that much land to feed everyone the same amount Americans eat.(g) We could still double+ our population.Current Food Production = Around 5 bn tons.Production need to eat like Americans = 7 bn tons. Of course, not everyone eats like an American, and America's eating problem is fixable. Only when you can't fix the problems, have Human begun to overpopulate.With this, I conclude my prior statement.</t>
<h>   Of all that land, they estimate only 37.5% of all Arable land is being used.(d) This means we could increase our population to 266.6% before needing a new way of farming.</h>

    <t>First off, I would like to provide a wider range of definitions of intelligence that you have provided; yes, intelligent beings are often described as needing to be able to solve problems head on, but it is far larger than that. Intelligence can be described as (per dictionary.com) the 'capacity for learning, reasoning, understanding, and similar forms of mental activity; aptitude in grasping truths, relationships, facts, meanings, ect.'. Whilst the ability to solve problems comes under some of the definitions provided, it also entails communication, speech, self-awareness and the ability to learn.  But with that said, onto the rebuttals;  1. They cannot solve problems like warfare - Often times, problems such as conflict and warfare cannot be sorted out by simple communication and diplomacy, as much as we would want. Warfare comes about by a number of reasons, often long standing tensions, such as what happened in both of the World Wars. The failure to make peace with the perceived enemy often chalks up, not our disability to make intellectual peace, but to make emotional war. Humans are animals, and like a number of animals, not only do our brain make rational decisions, but our emotions make irrational decisions. Emotions are the feeling often dissociated with rational, intelligent thoughts, and the way we evolved, as animals, often dictates that we should use emotion, not intelligence, as our prime mover, despite the fact that the intelligence is still there. Think about times during which warfare could of perceivably broken out (the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Berlin Blockade, ect.), and think of the damage that could of been done. Even in times of heightened emotion, humans can pull together, and use what they learnt, discern the facts, and come to a completely rational, intelligent compromise.  2. Our inability to explore space - This argument essentially fails to realize that space exploration is incredibly expensive and dangerous. Our ability to advance so far is an achievement within itself, but our lack of knowledge about said exploration is lacking. This, however, doesn't mean we're not intelligent, for as I stated before, intelligence is also the ability to learn, and that is what we have been able to do; learn from previous mistakes and build on them. Our scientific achievements, whilst obscured by governments in the past (the European dark ages for instance) chalks down more to human corruption (emotion) than it does to our lack of intelligence. Besides, would you be saying that we aren't intelligent if, in the future, we made advanced spaceships and planetary colonisers; scientific advance just takes time.  3. Humans destroying nature - I would like to say, before the modern age (1800 to now), the popular conciousness didn't know of global warming, or the far reaching effects of pollution; but as I've said before, lack of knowledge doesn't equal lack of intelligence. Today, thousands of people are protesting against large scale pollution caused by corporations, but our failure to do anything comes down to emotional corruption, caused by the greed of people and corporations (but let's not get into that). As I have already stated, emotions, and the ability to control them, would not make us any more intelligent than we could presently be, and would, in theory, make us less human (but again, let's not get into that). Governments around the world, together, right now, are bonding together to fight back against carbon emissions and global warming. This togetherness, this ability to (attempt) to solve problems, is something that is said to be defining attribute for intelligence, and our disability to completely solve it today can be chalked up to our complete misunderstanding and lack of foreknowledge in the past.  4. Medical advances - This could possibly be rebutted with the same arguments put out by the 'space exploration' rebuttal, but contains language that needs to be looked into. As I stated before, our lack of scientific advance in the past doesn't mean we are any less intelligent, and the fact that today we are advancing more quickly than ever before is a testament to our intelligence, not a detriment. The fact that you bring up human cloning is an interesting point, and is more of a moral debate, especially after stating they would be used for harvesting internal organs; something of which is going to be completely unnecessary in a few years, due to the advent of 3D printing, and the advances into the bio-engineering of internal organs.  Conclusion - Humans, no matter how emotional we get, no matter how much knowledge we lack, we still are intelligent beings, especially today, with the advent of technologies and innovations in all field of life that were not thought possible 10 years ago. Our progress today is a testament to our intellect, with the ability to cure many diseases, solve problems peacefully through international co-operation, and our opening advances into a new age of space exploration is truly a mark of our true intelligence.</t>

    <t>I apologize if my language wasn't appropriate for a debate. Can you give me some advices of something not to do..? This is one of my first times doing official debates.Because my English isn't that good, there are some points that I don't fully understand. I will summarize your rebuttals so that you may fix my understandings if I am wrong. (it's ok if the summary is only a little off and doesn't cause much misunderstandings)1. Warfare could not be solved because they are caused from from long lasting conflicts. The failure to stop wars isn't from the lack of intelligence but is from making irrational decisions based on their emotions. Learning from the past, it is better to make decisions based on emotions. However, at intense times, humans could pull their minds together and make rational decisions. 2. Humans had been learning from past mistakes and developing their sciences, achieving what is now an amazing achievement. The reason humans don't advance that much is because of human corruption and not the lack of intelligence. Also, the cost of space exploration is incredibly high. The technology humans have nowadays is a proof of intelligence itself. Scientific advance takes time. 3. Understood4. Current medical advancement is a proof of humans' intelligent. It could not advance so fast due to insufficient funds. Conclusion: UnderstoodMy rebuttals1. The failure to control emotions and let emotions control is a proof of our lack of intelligent. Looking back at the past, most conflicts occurred from emotional conflicts; most irrational decisions were made based on emotions. Not being able to surpass emotions, humans are no different from other animals; getting mad when hit or being scared when threatened. If humans really are smart, they should be able to intact their minds all the time and solve problems rationally, whether it's their daily life problems or warfare. 2. Being an intellectual being, humans should learn the fact that sticking with the current space exploration programs, the advancing of technologies would be slow. However, by changing the materials and goods used to build spaceships to other less expensive alternatives would be a large help to the advancement of the technologies. 3. It is humans' fault that the facts about global warming wasn't available in the past. If only humans are intelligent, the problem would have been known long time ago and easily solved before it gets out of hands. Also, protestants don't change the fact that nothing had been done to help reduce and prevent global warming. Something that would be more effective should be done instead. It shows that they are not learning from their actions. Humans falling for greediness is to blame the fact that they aren't intelligent enough to overcome it. Being able to control emotions would largely help humans become intellectual beings. Being able to control emotions is also being able to control greed. Without greed, things that aren't beneficial to humans won't be done and instead, only beneficial things would be done. The government slowly bonding to fight back against carbon emissions is so slow that by the time the have bonded and is ready to seriously stop global warming, the Earth would've become the Sun. 4. Many medical advancements didn't come from our intelligent. They came from mistakes. For example: Penicillin. Being able to advance faster than humans could in the past doesn't make them intelligent. Being intelligent means learning and adapting to problems. Nevertheless, being able to do it fast enough so that you don't die is also a must. Conclusion: Humans, no matter how many rational decisions they made, no matter how much knowledge they have obtained, as long as they still lose to emotions and greed, they are not intelligent. You could call this advancements less stupid, but not more intelligent. Only stating that humans learn from the past makes them an intellectual being, humans always advance, whether it's slowly or rapidly, not solving problems such as global warming because the knowledge wasn't acquired in the past, is not rational. Animals do learn. By intellectual beings, I agree with the given definitions. However, I would like to add that by being an intellectual being, it means that these intellectual beings are high in intelligent and is on average smarter than other existing species. (on Earth)</t>

    <t>Wow, my computer has been acting up lately, but I'm back for some rebuttals;  1. Failure to control emotions - Your criticism of our failure to control our emotions is a noted one, but it doesn't make sense when you get down to the core of it. Since when did humans have to control our emotions all the time to be considered intelligent. Throughout history, extremely intelligent men and women have made blunders, but that doesn't mean we lack intelligence. Intelligence can still be compatible with emotions, such as in the case of brutality. I don't want to get to graphic here, but if you have a victim (for any reason), it would be more intelligent to gang up on them than to go in alone. This emotional response is wrong on almost all accounts, but as already stated; intelligence comprises of many factors, including working together, for right or for wrong.  2. Space and technology - I agree, staying with our current models and technologies of space exploration would make our push away from Earth far slower over time, but you also must remember, we still need to discover, produce (on a mass scale) and sell these future technologies. Materials such as carbon nano-tubes have taken years to create, and it will be even more years before we can actually create them on a mass scale. Using our intellect and combined knowledge, we will be able to achieve this in far fewer years than ever before.  3. Global warming - I get the point you're trying to make, but humans had the knowledge they were limited to before the evidence for global warming began to appear in the 1950's. If we did not have the knowledge beforehand, we would never of known what could, or could not have happened. This is the same as the nuclear bomb; debate raged over what the bomb could do, and it would be humans first testing of it in 1945 in which we finally found out. Whilst this didn't stop us from dropping the bomb on Japan, we have been able to learn from these mistakes, and since WW2, we have been able to avoid nuclear war, using our knowledge and intellect. We now have the knowledge and intelligence to be able to bind together and stop global warming in very much the same manner as avoiding nuclear war since 1945.  My final thought on this point is that governments are combining quickly to put an end to climate change and the runaway greenhouse effect. The Kyoto protocol has been in effect since 1997, and in that time, the vast majority of nation-states have joined (with either binding or non-binding) targets of ending global warming. The same goes with the internal USA; whilst the government may support growth of the polluting corporations, the majority of citizens within the US do want to protect and defend the environment. Just because a minority of humans are 'not intelligent' doesn't mean the rest are.  4. Medical advances - Yes, many advances have occured by accident, but a large amount has not. Take Louis Pasteur for instance; his advances in the field of micro-biology, vaccines and medicine have significantly improved the health and well-being of men, women and children across the globe. Taking the knowledge and information he had been given, he used his intellect to make significant leaps forward for the human race. Whilst his story may only be one, it is one of many, as thousands, if not millions of humans throughout history have been able to set aside differences and work together, using the knowledge they had available, and advance as a species using their collective intelligence.  Conclusion - Intelligence comes in many forms, either for good or for bad, it encompasses many aspects. From the deceleration of a war, to the ability to work together to advance humans overall well-being, we use our collective knowledge and intelligence to move forward everyday. And whilst some, the vast minority for instance, may have other plans for our world and our species, I can assure you that the vast majority is ready and willing to actually use the organ between their ears and progress.</t>
<h>    We now have the knowledge and intelligence to be able to bind together and stop global warming in very much the same manner as avoiding nuclear war since 1945.</h>

    <t>Thank you. I wish you luck too.First of all, I would like to specify intellectual beings as suggested by Piccini. Intellectual beings are beings that have a considerately high EQ and IQ compared to other beings. Also, intellectual beings would be able to solve problems head-on, whether it's as small of a problem as quarrels between individuals or as big of a problem as a global crisis like global warming. 1. Humans claim that they are an 'intellectual being'. However, looking back at the past, the Great War and World War II were caused from greediness and small quarrels between leaders of countries. If humans really are smart, they would have sorted out the problem peacefully and would not have any means of using forces and military armies. 2. Humans had been discovering about the universe and trying to build spaceships to go out and conquer other planets. They call this an 'advanced technology' and 'in-dept knowledge'. In truth, what humans currently know about the universe is so little it couldn't even be compared with a pin in the ocean. 3. Humans had been destroying the nature; polluting rivers and oceans, contaminating the air, and cutting down trees. If humans really are intelligent and wise, they should know beforehand the problems they're creating for themselves; the problems that won't be fixed in time and cause a disastrous effect to the human race, like the saying 'Only after the last tree has been cut down. Only after the last river has been poisoned. Only after the last fish has been caught. Only then will you find that money cannot be eaten.' Furthermore, fish and other animals are being killed at an extremely rapid speed, causing species after species to go extinct. Without any prevention, mankind would be the last living race and would have nothing to eat. 4. Medical cares are improving all around the world. However, it is not good enough. Cloning had been successful in laboratories. Animals had been cloned. What about humans? Why aren't you being cloned so that your internal organs could be replaced in case of some accidents. I am looking forward to seeing your replies.</t>

    <t>Here we are, the final round of debating, and without a further ado;  1. Humans and emotion - Survival of the fittest doesn't fit with our world view today; we humans, right now, living on Earth, need to look out for ourselves, the environment, and countless other small things. Emotions and intellect (as you stated, working together) can often be used in unison, such as the protection of animals. We often stop the brutalisation of animals because of two reasons; 1. We care about animals due to our emotions, and 2. Without a large number of animals, the ecosystem would probably fall into itself, an example of intelligence. Without sympathy, we wouldn't have a planet, without intelligence, we wouldn't be trying to put a stop to the gross destruction of our forests and environments. Emotions and intelligence can often work in unison, and when this happens, it works.  Doesn't this point go against what you stated in your previous one; 'survival of the fittest is not always a bad idea' and 'ignore any sympathy'. Yes, humans over hunt and yes, we do do it for inane, ridiculous reasons, but look around you, people are now fighting back. With the advent of new technology, we have been able to kill more efficiently, but with that efficiency came more and more people fighting against it. Today, the amount of people that support the slaughter of animals and the environment is grossly outnumbered by those who want to save and protect, and our ability to work together collectively, as a species, towards the protection of the enviroment shows our true emotions, and our true intelligence.  2. The cost of resources - This proves nothing to the question at hand, and besides, humans have been making breakthroughs into discovering and/or developing these 'scarce recources', I've already said it. All that is needed now is a matter of time, and it will happen; humans will develop far better materials, humans will develop new and better ways of getting to space, it is all there in my previous arguments. Our ability to move forward, using the information we have is not a burden on the question of intelligence, but lifts the idea that humans are intelligent beings.  3. War and peace - But it proves they're intelligent. You stated in the second round, one area of intelligence could be defined as humans ability to solve problems, and they have done that. Dictators or democratically elected people, despite the amount of corruption, have been able to not ignite a nuclear war. Whether is was for themselves or not (we don't know what was going through their heads) one thing is certain; we are not dead and dying from the radioactive fallout of nuclear war, something that proved the quick thinking of leaders in times of crisis. On your second point, yes, humans care for the enviroment for financially beneficial reasons, but they also care for its protection. Does the UN, which is primarily an international, 'not-for profit' organization protect the enviroment because of its financially stable when its intact. Did so many nations sign the Kyoto protocol just to protect their income, and finally, are so many nations right now (like my home Australia) SPENDING billions of dollars on protecting the enviroment a proof that they care for it 'just for the money'. For all of the points, I do not think so; I believe that nations, and their inhabitants, as the majority, wish to protect the enviroment to actually see it survive, and continue, another proof of our intellect.  4. The bumps in the road - Yes, there are bad things going on in the world, and yes, there have always been bumps in the road, but if you looked around the world, you would see those bumps are filling. Wars are no longer as conventional and destructive as they once were, racism and bigotry is falling all over the world, humans are truly beginning to come together to help protect the enviroment, save animals, as well as people, in need, and further our knowledge and information about the sciences. It may take time, but our 'bad' emotions are no longer getting in the way of progress like they once were, a final proof of our true intellect of togetherness, and progress over many fields.  Conclusion - We have gotten so far in the 200,000 years of our existence. We started off as hunter-gatherers, followed by small settlements, followed by kingdoms, followed by empires, followed by the democratic world we live in today. All over, progress is furthering, our knowledge is furthering, or ability to grasp what it means to be human and our continuing quest for peace is furthering. Yes, the bumps have been the road, and there are plenty more ahead of us, but by the rate we are going, we will be able to protect the enviroment, we will be able to save animals and planet species that are at risk, we will put an end to war, we will see out the end of the century, together as one species, knowledgeable and intelligent.  I would like to thank Pandas for an incredibly interesting debate, and the time he has given up to debate over the past few days, and I too wish him well in the voting period.</t>

    <t>Thank you for your reply, and I too wish you luck for the final round;  1. Humans and emotion - Except for moral choices. Humans need emotion sometimes to guide them, as individuals, through tough times in their lives. Just because they had to make a hard decision doesn't mean they aren't intelligent; all it means is that we are emotional creatures, with the capacity of understanding and intellectual conversation. Humanity, and modern life, isn't as simple as a game of 1's and 2's; its far more complicated. Without emotion, we would basically be robots, willing to do work without a forethought of morals or sympathy. We would continue to take down the environment to help ourselves, we would continue to slaughter animals just to further our own comfort. We will feel bad about pulling that leaver, and there will be sorrow, but we can't act like robots, if we aren't to lose our humanity, and our true intelligence for togetherness and sympathy.  2. Technology and resources - What I meant with the 'mass production' and 'selling' aspect of the argument is that you shouldn't sell to the population, but to private companies or investors. These technologies will cost a lot of money up front, and you would need both the support of both companies (who would probably be the ones to invest and partake in astronomical mining) but also the population, who through taxes, would probably be investing in some way or another. I don't want to get too far away from the question asked, so I'll stand behind my argument; these technologies will cost a lot of money, and our failure to progress into far flung future technologies is not due to a lack of our intelligence, but to funds, lack of knowledge at this time, and the fact that technological process, whilst slow, is speeding up thanks to innovations brought about by our intelligence.  3. Global warming - Was it truly fear and greed that didn't bring about nuclear war? Perhaps, but it is probably more likely that they (government leaders) saw the destructive events that happened at both Nagasaki and Hiroshima, and believed that they, and their population, shouldn't be brought to a nuclear end. The want to survive appears in all populations, and that isn't stimulated by greed, but by nature. The leaders knew damn well that they could escape somewhere more safe, perhaps a bunker, but they still didn't bring doomsday to their people. Is it because of greed? No, it is because they probably truly cared for their people, and they wanted to protect not just themselves, but also the citizens. This want to protect human beings, and the environment (to an extent) from certain death proves of the leaders compassion for the masses, and them having the intelligence not to blow up the world.  I think the point I'm trying to make is that protecting the people, as well as protecting yourself, is as much a part of nature as it is human intelligence and sympathy. We need to get back on track with this argument, and not stray to far into new subjects.  4. Human togetherness - Yet it doesn't make them non-intelligent either. Your argument is that humans beings need to have substantial 'intellect' and 'knowledge' to be considered intelligent. Further more, you have stated that human beings, as a species, need to be intelligent as a majority. Where do you draw these lines; the ability to speak, the ability to work together, the ability to do one basic human action. Humans, throughout history have been working together towards goals, and every time their was a bump in the road, we have moved past it. Slavery is all but gone, homophobia is on the decline, women having voting rights now. This is a sign that we, humans, as a species, are beginning to become more open, and more intellectually aware of each other, and our compassion has all but gone up ten fold. Our new fond ability to work together is a sure sign that we are intellectual creatures.  Conclusion - Life isn't simple, it is a hard game to play. Intelligence cannot be defined by a simple action, nay a line drawn in sand. Our actions taken today may be based around emotions, but our true intelligence is found within working together, and that is what we have done. Progress, both in technology and in society have allowed us to go to the deepest trench of the ocean, to the moon itself. Today, we are progressing faster and faster, and our emotions, whilst they sometimes get in the way, don't distract from our true capacity for knowledge and problem solving.  Again, I would like to thank Pandas, and wish him luck in the final round of debating.</t>

    <t>I would like to thanks my opponent for his thoughtful arguments. It is finally round 4. I wish him luck in the final round.For now, my rebuttals:1. Humans never have to control their emotions all the time. It is because they are yet to be considered intelligent. It is a normal thing for you to gang up on your enemies. It is a basic common sense. If you go alone and die, then it is you being stupid. Right or wrong, without emotions, humans will be able to make the best choices. Suppose a train is coming and your friend is standing on the track. You are standing right next to the switch and could switch the track for the train. However, there are two strangers on the other track. What would be best here? Normally, people would choose to save their friend and let the two strangers die due to their emotions. Without emotions, people won't switch the track and only one life would be lost instead of two. With emotions, two lives lost for one. 2. Advanced technologies don't always need to be produced on a mass scale to be sold to normal people. Sometimse ignorance is needed for better advancement. It is like a chess game; a strategy called gambit. Looking at our world right now, it could be predicted that resources on Earth would be completely depleted in the near future. Instead of producing advanced technologies on a mass scale and selling it to the population, scientists might as well ignore the population for the time being and continue advancing the future technologies so that they would be able to get resources from other planets at a lower and beneficial cost. After that, they could start producing high-tech materials for the population.3. The fact that the nuclear wars are being prevented with our knowledge and intellect is half right. However, it is mostly being prevented by the fear and greed of humans; fear of dying and greediness, wanting to have things for themselves and their country. Without fear and greed, many problems would have resulted in a nuclear war by now. Only the minority of the population trying to stop global warming is like trying to move mountains with a tea spoon. It is moving forward but isn't going to reach its conclusion.Governments binding to prevent the greenhouse effect from going from worse to worst is like making war; what you see isn't what it is. Wars are created for the money and resources of the opposing countries. Likewise, the governments who control countries, being controlled by greed, just want money. Making new products and satisfying the population would allow them to continue the position as the government, allowing them to corrupt even longer and get wealthier and wealthier. 4. In order for humans to be considered intelligent, the majority of the population would have to have an appropriate amount of knowledge and intellect. Yes, there are some less stupid people who exists or existed. However, that does not makes the human race an intelligent species. I agree it is not a bad decision for people to join up and work together though. That would be more effective as an individual and as a whole. Conclusion- The only thing between the ears is air. It is true that people are working together to advance humans overall well-being and to move forward. Nevertheless, the majority of humans are still being manipulated by greed and emotions, causing them to make irrational decisions. This, proves the fact that humans are less stupid from before but is yet to be an intellectual being.</t>

    <t>1. Humans and emotion - As you have stated, life is not a simple game. However, that is only as it is right now; living life with emotions. If humans could control their emotions, life would be even more simple than drinking water or breathing itself. Make decisions that are best for themselves. Help others by taking care of yourself. Don't be a burden to others. Ignore any sympathy. Remember the rule 'survival of the fittest'. The weaks will die and that is not a bad thing. Instead of suffering through their life and end up dying miserably, they could be reborn or go to heaven or the afterlife. Nowadays humans are already taking down the environment to help themselves, let alone slaughtering animals just to further their comfort. Tigers, bears, whales, and many other animals that are not meant to be hunted to be eaten, are hunted down for decorations or unreasonable reasons. There is no sorrow or sympathy in these slaughterings. There is nothing; only the thought of living on. (and greed)2. Monies are things people use to pay for things and define how much things are worth. Rare materials are worth more so it cost more. Rare things that are hard to find cause 'scarcity'. If only humans get rid of the scarcity of materials needed for space exploration, whether through experimentation or obtaining from nature, the cost would be significantly lowered. 3. I still stand my point that corruption and greed are what prevented nuclear wars. Government wanting to protect their country and continue the post as the government is so that they could continue with corruption. When the country is in a poor state (after wars), there would be less things for them or it would be harder for them to corrupt. No one wants to protect human beings. Wars are going on all around the world right now and barely anyone cares. They also care for the environment to a minimal extent; they will always care for the environment as long as the environment is financially beneficial to them somehow. This, is what truly prevents nuclear wars. 4. There are bumps everywhere right now, whether it's prostitution, human trafficking, or illegal drugs. Countries are fighting with each other. There will always be a place with no sign of peace of togetherness. Let alone togetherness in the world when kids and civilians still fight with each other. There are many racists in this world; Black, Asians, or third-world countries.  Conclusion - Life will be very simple if humans could control their emotions. Without emotions, humans would be able to make flawless decisions purely based on their intellect. How well they make their decisions will be fully dependant on their intellect, not being intervened by emotions. Also, advancements don't always represent intellect. Stupid people could advance too.  Lastly, I would like to thanks the Pro for giving me an enjoyable debate with interesting arguments. I wish him luck for the voting period. Thanks.</t>

    <t>Introduction I thank my opponent for generously accepting this debate. I am going to be arguing in favor of the notion that homosexuals are an asset to the overall thriving of the human species. Population Growth On average, 360 people are born each day with only 150,000 that die each day[1]. This, on its face, seems like a staggering difference. Also, in 1993 the word population was at 5,535,753,998, however the world population today is roughly 7,066,964,964[2]. This means that in just 20 years the world population has increased by 1,531,210,0966 billion people. Here is a graph which illustrates population growth: Essentially, the point I am trying to get across is that the population is growing at an alarming pace. I think it is clear that the facts substantiate this quite well indeed. The Need For Population Control  Stabilisation, or gradual reduction in population is one of the best ways to address the carbon emissions problem. The National Academy of Sciences demonstrated that slowing the population growth rate of a country to 1.5 births per woman from 2 births per woman could result in a 10% drop in greenhouse gas emissions by the middle of the century, and a 33% drop by the end of the century[3]. Also, the lack of land mass on this planet is a huge issue: “Calculations have been made that any given land mass has a certain carrying capacity, based on its ability to support its inhabitants' needs.” – Colin Feltham[4]Another crucial aspect here is population growth's relation to poverty . Below are some simple statistics from 1950 - 85[5] showing a correlation between a rising population and the percentage of rising poverty:                                                                                                         Table 4-1 World Population 1950-85: Key Facts Size and Rates   1950  1960  1970  1980  1985 Total Population(billions)World2.53.03.74.44.8More developed regions0.830.941.051.141.17Less developed regions 1.68 2.072.653.313.66 Annual Growth *(per cent)World 1.82.01.91.7More developed regions 1.31.00.80.6Less developed regions 2.12.52.32.0 Urban Population(per cent)World2934374041More developed regions5467677072Less developed regions1722252931 As more human beings are being born, higher percentages of poverty throughout the population. Now, I agree that correlation does not necessarily equate to causation. When we are dealing with consistent correlation of this type however, then it does seem to suggest causation at the very least in context. The more people their are, the less finite resources there are for everybody; and poverty arises. This hypothesis would generally predict such statistics above, and best explains the data. The most important problem, in my opinion, is the problem of a growing population and finite resources. For example, theEarth Policy Institute showed that grain consumption of the world has far surpassed global production in six of the latest seven years, falling short with regards to the 60 million tonnes that was seen in 2006. Grain production has shown a huge declining trend within the past 20 years[6]. Also, we are losing our oil at an incredible speed:'The rapid increase in the world’s population over the last hundred years is not merely coincident with the rapid increase in oil production.' - Peter Goodchild[7] This section above shows a self-evident need for population control on a serious scale. There is no realistic way for human beings to flourish and thrive very much longer without it, as the planet cannot sustain this many people continuously into the future like we would hope. It seems apparent that logic, statistical evidence, and mere common sense can lead any rational agent to this obvious conclusion. The Homosexual's Role In Population ControlStraight people are the root cause of the population growth problem, and are on a path to leading our society down a path of pollution, poverty, and famine. They have sex, produce children, and those children grow up and do the same in a world that can barely sustain the people that already live in it. Straight sex acts are required for the existence of a society, but not the flourishing of a society once growth gets unreasonable. Our Earth and its contents are finite, so to think we can keep going on like this is fancifulHomosexuals are crucial to this picture, as they are less likely to have children by copulating with a female and producing offspring. The more homosexual and bisexual people there are having sex, the better grip we will have on population control, and less poverty there will be. It will increase the amount of land we will have to sustain us, and increase the resources in place for us to thrive as a society. With more people being born than dying each day at the hands of straight sex, homosexual acts are a clear benefit when taking population control into account. If everybody on Earth was straight, the problems associated with population growth would be much higher than it is today. It seems very probable that homosexuals may be our savior:'We preserve the species. We are conservation realized. We provide nature's ... restraint ... on procreative extravagance. We keep human production from becoming ... overproduction ... pollution ... destruction unbridled. We keep the human race from becoming ... an obscene cosmic joke.' - G. Roger Denson[8]G. Roger Denson states my main point very well, and also had this to say:'With the natural world on the brink of demise largely because of overpopulation, unrestrained homosexuality, as one of a variety of ethical and democratic measures available to us today, offers perhaps the most natural option to be enjoined. What other options are as attractive? We don't want to die young. We don't want to face illness or catastrophe. Many individuals and societies refuse abortion and birth control. Few would condone or submit willingly to the kind of international law imposing a one-child policy like that exercised by China on all nations. And we hardly need to be reminded of the history of racist, eugenicist, and militarist agendas for imposing growth control on unwilling and unknowing populations. So why shouldn't homosexuality be seen as providing a viable option to overpopulation--to the point that the world's nations come to encourage its practice and esteem its benefits? It is, after all, the most harmonious way to control the population--considering all that's required is that we love and support our gay sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, parents, friends, lovers, and selves.' -  G. Roger Denson[8]Conclusion The population is growing to the point where our planet can barely sustain us. This is due to straight sex acts on a massive scale. Homosexual acts cause somewhat of a balance in nature, as homosexuals are way less likely to have the type of intercourse which creates offspring. Homosexuals are a way to sustain our species; so the planet can sustain us. For this reason, it is reasonable to conclude that homosexuals are an asset to the overall thriving of the human species. I look forward to Con's rebuttal.</t>

    <t>IntroductionI thank my opponent for his response, however he ignored the bulk of my arguments; thus they still stand unscathed. Also, I clicked 'submit' by accident and posted my last round without double-checking for errors. I meant to say '360,000 people die each day', not '360 people die each day' for instance. I do apologize for any confusion pertaining to my last round. Population Growth My opponent here says that birth rates have been on a decline within the past 12 years. This is a red herring[1] logical fallacy, as it has no bearing on the resolution we are discussing. Even if birth rates have been on the decline, that would not mean that homosexuality does not help to aid the population growth problem. For example, if I have money problems, but my money is actually starting to increase, does that mean that an extra $1000.00 is not an asset, or does not help? Of course not. Even if the problem is starting to be solved, that extra money is still an asset. Similarly, even if birth rates are decreasing; homosexuality is still an asset because it aids in the decrease of the overall population. This section from Con does absolutely nothing to undermine my argument. I am not arguing that homosexuals are essential to the overall thriving of the human species, just that they are an asset. An extra good player on my Chess team is an asset, but we can do well without him, so he is not essential. Regardless, lets take a look at my opponent's first chart here: You will notice that way more people are being born than are dying. Thus, even if birth rates are decreasing, the population itself is still growing at a staggering rate. Therefore, this section from Con is rather trivial. 'Despite lower expected fertility rates, [the world population] is likely to reach 9.1 billion by 2050, with most of the increase taking place in developing countries...'[2]The point the above quote is trying to get across, is even with a decrease in birth rates, population growth is still out of control. We Definitely Do Need Population Control My opponent completely ignored all my arguments in favor of the need for population control. Con never addressed the statistical evidence that population growth causes the percentage of poverty around the globe to rise. He never addressed my evidence that food and oil companies cannot keep up with the global population growth, and that our finite resources are being lost at a staggering rate. Con never addressed my evidence that population control is the best way to lower Co2 emissions, and did not object to my claims about finite habitable land. Con just pretended like my arguments did not even exist, and presented a lackluster case against the notion that we need population control. He quotes one person who seems to disagrees with me, but he did not post any statistical evidence to back up his claims. Lets delve into the arguments for the need for population control a little further shall we?Fossil FuelsOil is a finite resource that our entire economy depends on[3]. Con probably just wants people to forget about this, however this problem will not go away unless action is taken. We are losing way too much of our oil at the hands of the growing population: People are being killed in the middle east over oil. I do not believe people should die over oil. The human species cannot thrive with wars over finite resources. This scarcity problem is largely due the population growth problem. This seems to suggest that it is fanciful to view population control as anything less than needed. People are going to extreme measures to obtain this precious substance, when we do not have to fight over oil. All we need to do is keep the population down. Also, Petroleum is declining at an average yearly rate of between 2% and 6%, maybe nearer to 4%[4]Food and WaterFamine and shortage of water is going to be a huge problem in our future, as there are too many people to feed the world already. It is also commonly known that overpopulation is the cause of famine in many counties[5], and that population growth and famine are inherently linked[6]. These are irrefutable facts. Here is an illustrative chart regarding population and carrying capacity:Also, take Ethiopia. It is quite known that they have a famine problem, and it is also known that population growth is the culprit[7]. I am sincerely baffled as to how Con cannot argue with a straight face that we do not need population control. Additionally, there is a clear correlation here with regards to population growth and water shortages:PollutionAreas with the most people have the most pollution[8]. Pollution harms human beings, and hinders the flourishing and thriving of our species[9]. This further demonstrates the need for population control on a massive scale.ConclusionCon mentioned a birth rate decrease, but not a population decrease; thus his argument with regards to my 'Population Growth' section is a red herring. My opponent does not contest the fact that the population is growing at an alarming rate. Against the need for population control Con provided no case, and no statistical evidence. He simply quoted a man who disagrees with me. I provided overwhelming evidence in favor of the need for population control. My opponent also did not contest the fact the if population control is needed, that homosexuals would be an asset. Due to the fact that I sufficiently supported my case, and Con had a rather weak rebuttal; it is safe to say that the resolution has been affirmed.I look forward to my opponent's rebuttal.</t>

    <t>Introduction I would also like to thank my opponent for posting both an interesting and tough topic. I will be arguing that population growth is not the problem and that homosexuals do not help in the overall thriving of the Human species.Population GrowthI would like to focus the population Growth for the past 12 years. In the year 2000 the population of the world was 6,082,966,429 and now in 2013 the population of the world is at 7,124,339,094 and growing and by the year 2050 the population will be estimated to be at 9,346,399,468. When you look at the graph below you will see how the climb of the population is: My opponent alludes to that we need to lower the birth rate so that population can begun to stabilize, but by the next chart the birth rate has actually gone down in the last 12 years.  Birth rate (births/1,000 population) It doesn't make any sense does it the Birth rate is going down, but the population is increasing. The reason for this is the advancements in medical practice has kept children alive longer. Now days if a preemie child that is given treatment early nearly has a 70% chance for survival while back even 12 years ago the child had a very little chance to live. With the medical treatment diseases don't kill like they used to and people can get medicine fast. Such discoveries like an Once-a-day HIV Pill,Targeted Drug Therapies for Cancer, Hormone Replacement Therapy,Advances in Treating Coronary Heart Disease, having vaccines for diseases and eliminating diseases from existence, etc.  When you look at the death rate as seen here. Death rate (deaths/1,000 population) We Don't Need Population Control The fear should not be about overpopulation it should be for depopulation. Very low fertility is when a birth rate is below 1.5 children per woman. Europe experienced this between 1995-2000 when there birth rate was 1.42. The consequences of these very low levels of procreation are told by U.N. demographer Joseph Charnie when he addressed the Population Association of America on April 2, 2004-'Growing number of countries view their low birth rates with the resulting population decline and ageing to be a serious crisis jeopardizing the basic foundations of the nation and threatening its survival Economic growth and vitality, defense, and pensions and health care for the elderly for example, are all areas of major concern.' Europe has had problems with their birth rate and it has hurt their economy and nations strength. Society that have a low growth rate tend to fall and if the idea that homosexuals will lower birth rate will actually hurt human thriving.Conclusion Even with lower birth rates population still is increasing. Homosexuality has nothing to do with the thriving and if anything it hurts the thriving by not having children countries can face economic and overall society struggle. I look forward to my opponents rebuttal. </t>

    <t>IntroductionI would thank my opponent as well. We Don't Need population Control 1. Like I stated before when a population is decreasing the country faces many problems. Like lower employment and a bad economy.2. Co2 has been proven not to get the world hotter, but instead it cools the Earth because it bounces the Co2 back into the atmosphere. The largest green house gas is water vapor, no one can stop water vapor unless you want to stop volcanoes and the evaporation cycle. Also the world goes through a cycle of warming and cooling has evident here-3. If the fear is lack of energy by oil than the world must adampt. Around the world people are becoming less dependement on fossil fuel and turning to green energy. Like solar, wind, water, and nuclear power that countries already have adopted and other countres will when the fossil fuel go down.4.The problem is not food stortages it is the way we spread it out. We grow enough food to feed 10 billion people, but the problem is not supply it is how the food is getting around. So homosexuals have nothing to do with this.5. Homosexuals have nothing to do with birth rate. The birth's have not changed the thing that has changed is the children being born out of wedlock. That has increased by 17% since 1970. What homosexuals acutally do is that they adopt these children and actually help the populaiton growth. Because a child that is fatherless is more likly to commit sucide also they are more likely to get married and have children. If homosexuals raise childen than the fatherless is taken out causing less death from inflicted injury. 6. If we want population control than homosexuality won't help in this. Countries fear depopulation than overpopulaiton, becasue we have the resources for 10 billion people, but we can't survive with less.</t>

Thus, it can be disregarded. I provided statistical evidence and facts proving the need for population control. He completely ignored the notion that the more people there are, the higher percentage of poverty arises. I will show this chart[1] again:                                                                                                         Table 4-1 World Population 1950-85: Key Facts Size and Rates   1950  1960  1970  1980  1985 Total Population(billions)World2.53.03.74.44.8More developed regions0.830.941.051.141.17Less developed regions 1.68 2.072.653.313.66 Annual Growth *(per cent)World 1.82.01.91.7More developed regions 1.31.00.80.6Less developed regions 2.12.52.32.0 Urban Population(per cent)World2934374041More developed regions5467677072Less developed regions1722252931 Co2 emissions'2. Co2 has been proven not to get the world hotter... ' - ProThe above is false, and virtually every climate change scientists agrees with me.  'It is the major greenhouse gas produced by humans, which is having the single greatest effect on climate change.'[2] I think my opponent just simply needs to get his facts straight. The scientific consensus is that global warming is due to Co2[3]. Carbon dioxide is released through natural processes such as respiration and volcano eruptions and through human actions like deforestation, land use changes, and burning fossil fuels. We have increased Co2 concentration by 1/3 since the Industrial Revolution started. This is the most crucial long-lived 'forcing' of climate change[3]. Here is another chart showing how temperature rises in correlation with Co2 rising:'The bottom line is that atmospheric carbon dioxide acts as a thermostat in regulating the temperature of Earth.' - Andrew Lacis[4]Andrew Lacis did not just commit a bare assertion, but science proves his statement. My opponent talks about a 'bouncing' effect but without non-condensing greenhouse gases, clouds and the vapor of water would not be ale to provide the feedback mechanisms that amplify the greenhouse effect[4].It seems as if my opponent is simply mistaken. It has been proven beyond a reasonable shadow of a doubt that human beings and Co2 are the reason for the temperature rising. This is the general consensus in climate change science, and it is bascked up by an overwhelming amount of scientific evidence.Fossil FuelsMy opponent says that because of free energy, oil will not be that important. However, this just seems like fantasy in the short term. The US and other major nations still rely on oil, and will for many decades to come. Therefore, as long as this is the case, we need the population down so we can all thrive. Saying that we can solve the oil problem just by getting free-energy universally is a cop out, as its easier said than done. Our economy is too dependant on oil at this point to take my opponent's objection here seriously (at least in the short term). Regardless, I mentioned other finite resources and fossil fuels that my opponent just ignored.Food and WaterMy opponent completely ignored my evidence that the food and water supply cannot catch up to population growth. This alone shows a need for population control. Since homosexuals help the problem by not reproducing nearly as as often as straight people, they are an asset (even if only a small asset).HomosexualsMy opponent says that homosexuals have nothing to do with the birth rate. This is obviously false, as homosexuals cannot produce children together naturally. Also, adopting children does not aid in population growth, as they are adopting children instead of having children. This means, homosexuality aids in population control, not population growth. If they were straight, they would have just reproduced instead of adopting a child that already exists. 'Homosexual men marry much less frequently and have far fewer children than their unambiguously heterosexual counterparts.' -  E. O. Wilson[5]ConclusionI have shown that population control is needed. Even if it is not needed (which it is), at the very least I showed that it would help many of our problems with regards to the flourishing and thriving of human beings. If it can help, then homosexuals can help because they have fewer children than straight people and stabilise the birth rate more. This means that even if they are only a little asset, they are still an asset. My opponent's objections seem to consist of mostly misinformation, and ignoring much of my argument. Therefore, the resolution seems to have been affirmed. </t>

    <t>1. I did state that decreasing population gives countries problems like lower and employment and a bad economy. I backed it up by a statement by U.N. demographer Joseph Charnie that the statement is in my first round sources. This man does population statics and the cause and effect.  2. 98% of all greenhouse gases is water vapor. The hotter the temperature more water vapor is formed causing the Earth to get hotter. That is the main reason for Global Warming when the temperatures rise the water vapor increases. Co2 has a double affect it bounces radiation away from the Earth, but also keeps some of it. But water vapor is what makes it hotter like humidity in an area even if the temperature isn't very high if the humidity is the area feels hot.  3. The United States has more oil than Saudi Arabia. Even though a lot of it is not obtainable yet it will be when we improve our technology. The United States has already made strides in improving green energy. While the United States is not ready to go completely off of fossil fuels it still has over 100 years of oil from Saudi Arabia and even more years from our own resources. These resources can be sold around the world helping in a global fashion.  4. I have a source that shows that the world produces enough food to feed 10 billion people. That means even by 250 when the population is supposed to be 9 billion we could feed the world.  5. While Homosexuals can't have children there are still straight people. In the 2000 U.S. Census Bureau found that homosexual couples constitute less than 1% of American households. That still leaves 99% of household able and are having children. Even though the birth rate has gone down the amount hasn't. With more people able to have children thanks to sperm donators even when a person is unable to have children naturally thanks to medical advancements they can have children.  Homosexuals don't change anything. My opponent shows all of the supposed dangers of an overpopulated world, but doesn't show how much homosexuals would change the number. Because it won't people will still have children and the population will increase whether people are homosexual or not.  sources </t>

    <t>I thank Sabutai for letting me part of this debate. I have only just seen the part of the Round 2 requirements which includes the terminology 'no rebuttals by Pro', which I do consider somewhat odd being that Con has provided material which I believe probably does deserve an immediate response in order to give Con time to revise or clarify certain parts of his argument. Still, I do have enough in my arsenal for me to present a better case than what Con presents for my case that humans are indeed the main cause of global warming. Let us begin:  Agriculture  Something that people are not so aware of with regards to global warming is the contribution of agriculture - which is to say livestock and farming - which is third in the world for CO2 emissions. CO2 isn't even the leading GHG emission from farming, as methane is the major contributing by-product. It is huge (1). To quote:  'In 2010, global greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector totaled 4.7 billion tons of carbon dioxide (COv(2)) equivalent, up 13 percent over 1990. Agriculture is the third largest contributor to global emissions by sector, following the burning of fossil fuels for power and heat, and transportation. In 2010, emissions from electricity and heat production reached 12.5 billion tons, and emissions from transport totaled 6.7 billion tons.  Despite their continuing rise, emissions from agriculture are growing at a much slower rate than the sector as a whole, demonstrating the increasing carbon efficiency of agriculture. From 1990 to 2010, the volume of agricultural production overall increased nearly 23 percent, according to data compiled by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) for its program, FAOSTAT. FAO released a new Greenhouse Gas Emissions database for agriculture, forestry and other land use changes in December 2012. According to FAO, methane accounts for just under half of total agricultural emissions, nitrous oxide for 36 percent, and carbon dioxide for some 14 percent. The largest source of methane emissions is enteric fermentation, or the digestion of organic materials by livestock, predominantly beef cattle. This is also the largest source of agricultural emissions overall, contributing 37 percent of the total.'  There is, quite simply, no way that this much methane and nitrous oxide are from natural causes, and the fact that 50%of the earth's surface is given over to farm and grazing land means a huge loss of forest, which serves as a carbon sink(the main sink is the oceans, however), so combined deforestation plus emissions from agriculture are man made.  The amount of Arctic Ice Loss  This is now greater than it has been in 3 million years, and this absolutely cannot be said to be from natural causes. To quote (2):  'The thaw and release of carbon currently frozen in permafrost will increase atmospheric CO2 concentrations and amplify surface warming to initiate a positive permafrost carbon feedback (PCF) on climate'. [Our] estimate may be low because it does not account for amplified surface warming due to the PCF itself'. We predict that the PCF will change the arctic from a carbon sink to a source after the mid-2020s and is strong enough to cancel 42-88% of the total global land sink. The thaw and decay of permafrost carbon is irreversible and accounting for the PCF will require larger reductions in fossil fuel emissions to reach a target atmospheric CO2 concentration.  The permafrost permamelt contains a staggering '1.5 trillion tons of frozen carbon, about twice as much carbon as contained in the atmosphere, much of which would be released as methane. Methane is 25 times as potent a heat-trapping gas as CO2 over a 100 year time horizon, but 72 times as potent over 20 years! One of the most conservative assumptions the study made, the lead author Dr. Kevin Schaefer confirmed in an email, is that all of the carbon would be released as CO2 and none as methane.'  And to quote from another study about the Arctic (3):  ' 'The bad news is that there is a clear connection between temperature and the amount of sea ice. And there is no doubt that continued global warming will lead to a reduction in the amount of summer sea ice in the Arctic Ocean. The good news is that even with a reduction to less than 50% of the current amount of sea ice the ice will not reach a point of no return: a level where the ice no longer can regenerate itself even if the climate was to return to cooler temperatures,' [lead author Svend] Funder says. '  So chalk up another point for how influential mankind is in contributing to global warming.  Deforestation  This one is plainly simple (4), because according to CO2 NOW, we find the situation where forest loss contributes 9% to CO2 build up, and forests account for 26% of CO2 absorption, so deforestation has been a huge man made contributor as well.  The reliability and enduring nature of the hockey stick graph  According to the New Scientist article covering the 2006 report of the US National Academy of Science (5):  'The report states: 'The basic conclusion of Mann et al. (1998, 1999) was that the late 20th century warmth in the Northern Hemisphere was unprecedented during at least the last 1000 years. This conclusion has subsequently been supported by an array of evidence that includes both additional large-scale surface temperature reconstructions and pronounced changes in a variety of local proxy indicators, such as melting on ice caps and the retreat of glaciers around the world'.  Most researchers would agree that while the original hockey stick can - and has - been improved in a number of ways, it was not far off the mark. Most later temperature reconstructions fall within the error bars of the original hockey stick. Some show far more variability leading up to the 20th century than the hockey stick, but none suggest that it has been warmer at any time in the past 1000 years than in the last part of the 20th century. ... Climate scientists, however, are only too aware of the problems (see Climate myths: It was warmer during the Medieval period), and the uncertainties were both highlighted by Mann's original paper and by others at the time it was published. ... The new reconstruction has been generated using two statistical methods, both different to that used in the original study. Like other temperature reconstructions done since 2001 (see graph), it shows greater variability than the original hockey stick. Yet again, though, the key conclusion is the same: it's hotter now than it has been for at least 1000 years.  In fact, independent evidence, from ice cores and sea sediments for instance, suggest the last time the planet approached this degree of warmth was during the interglacial period preceding the last ice age over 100,000 years ago. It might even be hotter now than it has been for at least a million years.  Further back in the past, though, it certainly has been hotter - and the world has been a very different place. The crucial point is that our modern civilisation has been built on the basis of the prevailing climate and sea levels. As these change, it will cause major problems.'  It is quite clear that all this evidence is very strong for the weight of man's influence in helping global warming along. I now hand back to Con.  </t>
<h>    One of the most conservative assumptions the study made, the lead author, is that all of the carbon would be released as CO2 and none as methane.' The bad news is that there is a clear connection between temperature and the amount of sea ice.</h>

    <t>I would like to thank JonMilne for accepting this debate.I. The Universe and Global WarmingThe current state of the Galaxy and our Sun is affecting our temperatures.I.i. The Rest of the Solar SystemThe Sun clearly is in a warmer phase, because all of the other planets have increasing temperatures as well. 'In 2005 data from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor and Odyssey missions revealed that the carbon dioxide 'ice caps' near Mars's south pole had been diminishing for three summers in a row.Habibullo Abdussamatov, head of space research at St. Petersburg's Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory in Russia, says the Mars data is evidence that the current global warming on Earth is being caused by changes in the sun.'[1]''Global warming on Neptune's moon Triton as well as Jupiter and Pluto, and now Mars has some [scientists] scratching their heads over what could possibly be in common with the warming of all these planets … Could there be something in common with all the planets in our solar system that might cause them all to warm at the same time?''[2] Two things can be drawn from this. One, that if other planets are warming, that it is only natural for the Earth to be warming as well. And second, that even if all these planets did have natural causes, then that is a sign of Earth's natural climatic change, instead of man-made. I.ii. The Position of the Milky Way GalaxyEvery approximately 135 million years, Earth enters a more populated area of the Milky Way, and as a result, more cosmic rays hit the Earth, which causes cooling. Currently, we are in a less populated area of the Milky Way, which means that less of these cosmic rays will be hitting the Earth, which means less cloud formation, and of course, warming. [3] for the source on this hypothesis. The sun can also cause this through evaporation.II. Earthly CausesThere are many internal causes of Global Warming as well. II.i. Ocean Current Anomalies Ocean temperature anomalies seem to be rising-along with the temperature. '...one can model past temperatures as a linear trend (that started well before CO2 was added in any substantial quantity) and periodic bumps... ...temperatures over the last 100+ years look a lot like a linear trend plus ocean cycle-driven bumps'[4] What is causing all the bumps?:[4]As shown in the graph, the PDO, or ocean currents, temperature has affected the average Earth's temperature. II.ii. Clouds: A Continuation of Point I.ii.I mentioned about the position of the Milky Way Galaxy and the Sun in regards to these 'cosmic rays'. Here is a more in depth look at the effects of position. 'The implications, if true, had potentially enormous implications for the debate about natural causes of warming. When the sun is very active, it can be thought of as pushing away cosmic rays from the Earth, reducing their incidence. When the sun is less active, we see more cosmic rays. This is fairly well understood. But if Svensmark was correct, it would mean that periods of high solar output should coincide with reduced cloud formation (due to reduced cosmic race incidence), which in turn would have a warming effect on the Earth, since less sunlight would be reflected back into space before hitting the Earth.Here was a theory, then, that would increase the theoretical impact on climate of an active sun, and better explain why solar irradiance changes might be underestimating the effect of solar output changes on climate and temperatures.'[4]'Since he first suggested his hypothesis over a decade and a half ago, Svensmark and other researchers have slowly been putting together research to test it.' The results were: 'Scientists found that when shielding was removed and natural cosmic rays allowed to hit the chamber, cloud seeding increased dramatically, and it increased substantially again when additional artificial cosmic rays were added. Svensmark appears to have gotten it right.'[5] Proof here is in the next points. III. The 1500-Year Cycle This has to do with a cycle of the climate that can explain the warming. 'Through at least the last million years, a moderate 1500-year warm-cold cycle has been superimposed over the longer, stronger Ice Ages and warm interglacials.'[6]Here is a graph related to this: [7]There are two things we can conclude from this graph. First, that up-and-down cycles are normal for the long-term climate. This century's global warming is nothing new. The second thing we can conclude, is that today's global warming is not as bad as the Medieval Warm Period's peak yet, and the Medieval Warm Period was less than the Holocene Maximum Period. 'Even more important, the earth is not 'the warmest it has ever been.' In fact, the earth was much warmer during the Medieval Warm Period when human agriculture flourished!'[7]'The scientists found evidence that on average, every 1,470 years, plus or minus 500 years, cold, ice-bearing waters, which today circulate around southern Greenland, pushed as far south as Great Britain.'[8] There seems to be a full cycle of up-down-up temperatures of the climate every 1470 years. And this goes as far back as at least 1 million years ago. Currently, we are in an upswing of temperatures, just coming off of the Little Ice Age, the peak to be in a few hundred years, making the peak-to-peak difference between today's global warming and the Medieval Warm Period a little less than 1500 years. So today's Global Warming is a natural, cyclical occurence. IV. The Sun: The Proof of Theories I.ii and II.iiThe sun's cycles have a lot to do with temperatures also. 'In this chamber, 63 CERN scientists from 17 European and American institutes have done what global warming doomsayers said could never be done — demonstrate that cosmic rays promote the formation of molecules that in Earth’s atmosphere can grow and seed clouds, the cloudier and thus cooler it will be. Because the sun’s magnetic field controls how many cosmic rays reach Earth’s atmosphere (the stronger the sun’s magnetic field, the more it shields Earth from incoming cosmic rays from space), the sun determines the temperature on Earth.'[9]'Svensmark matched the data on cosmic rays from the neutron monitor in Climax, Colorado, with the satellite measurements of solar irradiance from 1970 to 1990. Over the period between 1975 and 1989, he found cosmic rays decreased by 1.2 percent annually, amplifying the sun's change in irradiance about four-fold'[6]So, as the sun's activity increases, so does the temperature. This below graph shows the correlation: [10]This graph clearly shows that temperature goes up and down with solar activity, because an increase in solar activity directly correlates with an increase in average temperature 1-2 years later. And as a final side note, I would like to present this graph that helps disprove the anthropogenic cause theory, regarding again, ocean temperature anomalies:[4]So 'nature' created the same temperature trend as 'humans' did.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank JonMilne for presenting his arguments. I. Greenhouse GasesBefore I begin, here is a chart showing which greenhouse gases absorb which wavelengths of light: [1]I.A. MethaneFrom the chart, it can be seen that methane has an absorption band (at 8 micrometres) that largely overlaps with water vapor, so an increase in methane has little effect on temperature.[1]Also, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill put out a lot of methane, but: 'methane respiration rates increased to levels higher than have ever been recorded, ultimately consuming it and prohibiting its release to the atmosphere.What the Deepwater Horizon incident has taught us is that releases of methane with similar characteristics will not have the capacity to influence climate.'[2][3]I.B. Nitrous OxideIn addition to methane, the wavelengths of light that nitrous oxide absorb largely overlap with that of water vapor, so an increase in nitrous oxide also has little effect on temperature.[1]Also, a new  by Lucky Savings' href='#'gt;study found that cattle grazed on the grasslands of China actually reduce another greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide, meaning that agriculture reduces this greenhouse gas.[4][5]I.C. Carbon DioxideThere are many proofs that this amount of carbon dioxide will not affect temperatures, but I will post four. But first, again, the wavelengths of light carbon dioxide absorbs also largely matches up with water vapor, meaning it also has little effect on temperature. First, by the greenhouse effect, global warming should be starting from the lower atmosphere and moving to the surface, but this is not happening: '... by Lucky Savings' href='#'gt;satellite and high-altitude balloon data confirm that the lower atmosphere is not trapping lots of additional heat due to higher CO2 concentrations. It is hard to know how fast the Earth's highly variable surface is warming, but it is warming faster than the lower atmosphere where the CO2 is accumulating. This is strong evidence that CO2 is not the primary climate factor.'[6]Here is a graph showing how the surface has warmed more than the troposphere: [1] (Blue line is troposphere temperatures)Second, CO2 is a lagging indicator. The most recent study on this concluded that the results of their tedious but meticulous analysis led them to ultimately conclude that 'the CO2 increase lagged Antarctic deglacial warming by 800 +/- 200 years.'[7][8]Here is a graph showing this:  [9]Third, CO2's effect on temperature is logarithmic, meaning that each additional increase has a smaller effect on the climate than the last. 'The carbon that is already up in the atmosphere absorbs most of the light it can. CO2 only soaks up its favorite wavelengths of light and it's close to its saturation point. It manages to grab a bit more light from wavelengths that are close to its favorite bands but it can't do much more, because there are not many left-over photons at the right wavelengths.'[1][9]Here is a graph showing the logarithmic curve:  [10]. Note how the pre-industrial to modern level increase has had less than a 0.2 C increase in temperature. Fourth, and most importantly, if greenhouse gases are warming the earth we are supposed to see the first signs of it in the patch of hot air 10 kilometers above the tropics. However, we don't see that. Here is the predicted 'hot spot' of greenhouse gas caused warming: [11]While here is the actual atmospheric temperature variation: [9][11]Even so, CO2 has not correlated well with the climate anyway. Throughout the past 600 million years, almost one-seventh of the age of the Earth, the mode of global surface temperatures was ~22C, even when carbon dioxide concentration peaked at 7000 ppmv, almost 20 times today's near-record-low concentration.[12]Here is a chart showing CO2 concentrations and temperatures over time:  [12]Overall, CO2 has a correlation coefficient of 0.44, which is considered poor.[13]II. The Hockey Stick The hockey stick is wildly inaccurate: 'The dataset used to make this construction contained collation errors, unjustified truncation or extrapolation of source data, obsolete data, incorrect principal component calculations, geographical mislocations and other serious defects. These errors and defects substantially affect the temperature index. The major finding is that the values in the early 15th century exceed any values in the 20th century. The particular hockey stick shape derived in the MBH98 proxy construction a temperature index that decreases slightly between the early 15th century and early 20th century and then increases dramatically up to 1980 is primarily an artefact of poor data handling, obsolete data and incorrect calculation of principal component.[1][14]Temperatures have been warmer than today as recently as 1300 ACE.'During the Medieval Warming... . Temperatures may have been as much as 2.5 degrees C warmer [than today] due to a southward shift of the climate belts.'[6]Here is a graph showing temperatures in Greenland over the last 10,000 years: [15]And on other side of the world in Antarctica: [15]Both clearly show that today's temperatures are relatively cool compared to earlier times. Why is the Medieval Warm Period not represented? 'A senior IPCC researcher said in an email 'We have to get rid of the Medieval Warm Period.' Christopher Monckton says 'They did this by giving one technique, measurement of tree-rings from bristlecone pines, 390 times more weighting than other techniques but didn't disclose this.'[1]The hockey stick has little credibility. III. Arctic Sea IceI'm not going to get so much into this since I already disproved that CO2 causes warming, but I will say two things. One, here is a graph showing geomagnetic field strength (a measure of solar activity) and CO2 versus temperature (a measure of sea ice loss):  [16]It is clear that solar activity is a lot more important than CO2 is in arctic ice loss. Two, my opponent neglects the Antarctic. If the greenhouse thoery were valid, temperatures in the Arctic and the Antarctic would have risen several degrees Celsius since 1940 due to the huge emissions of man-made CO2... Recently, a team led by the University of Chicago's Peter Doran published a paper in Nature saying, '...our spatial analysis of Antarctic meteorological data demonstrates a net cooling on the Antarctic continent between 1966 and 2000'. The data from 21 Antarctic surface stations show an average continental decline of 0.008 degrees C from 1978 to 1998, and the infrared data from satellites operating since 1979 show a decline of 0.42 degrees C per decade. They report that satellite imaging shows increases in Souther Ocean sea ice parameters from 1978 to 1996 and an increase in the length of the sea-ice season in the 1990s'[6]Here is the Antarctic Sea Ice anomaly:[17]It's increasing, which is a sign of cooling.</t>

    <t>For R3, I will focus on rebutting Con's R2.  'The Great Global Warming Swindle'  Much of my opponent's arguments basically borrows from ideas that haven't held up in a long while and are generally dismissed by the vast majority of climate change scientists. This article (6) in New Scientist articulately explains:  'Take the repeated claims that recent global warming is mostly or all due to solar changes. In 1991, for instance, a paper in Science (7) claimed there was a striking correlation between variations in the solar cycle length and temperature between 1880 and 1980, suggesting greenhouse gases have not played as big a role as thought. However, the correlation has not held up after 1980 (8). What is more, it turns out that the apparent correlation before 1980 is due to manipulation of the data (9). Despite being discredited, this graph is still being presented as evidence against human-induced global warming today (see The Great Global Warming Swindle entry in Wikipedia).  Similarly, studies suggesting that the lower atmosphere and the oceans are cooling, contrary to what climate models predict, have turned out to be wrong. Later studies have shown the apparent coolings to be a result of errors in equipment or calibration (See Sceptics forced into climate climb-down) (9).  By contrast, the famous 'hockey stick' graph has been the subject of a determined campaign to discredit it (see The hockey stick graph has been proven to be wrong) (10). Yet later temperature reconstructions and other evidence back the key conclusions of the original hockey stick study (See Climate: The great hockey stick debate.)'  Just How Much Influence DOES Solar Energy Have?  The big sticking point in our debate has been the issue of precisely how much influence the sun has on global warming. For this, we must look to what has been found by actual science (11):  'As supplier of almost all the energy in Earth's climate, the sun has a strong influence on climate. A comparison of sun and climate over the past 1150 years found temperatures closely match solar activity (Usoskin 2005). However, after 1975, temperatures rose while solar activity showed little to no long-term trend. This led the study to conclude, ''during these last 30 years the solar total irradiance, solar UV irradiance and cosmic ray flux has not shown any significant secular trend, so that at least this most recent warming episode must have another source.'  In fact, a number of independent measurements of solar activity indicate the sun has shown a slight cooling trend since 1960, over the same period that global temperatures have been warming. Over the last 35 years of global warming, sun and climate have been moving in opposite directions. An analysis of solar trends concluded that the sun has actually contributed a slight cooling influence in recent decades (Lockwood 2008).'  This conclusion is confirmed by many studies finding that while the sun contributed to warming in the early 20th Century, it has had little contribution (most likely negative) in the last few decades. For the purposes of space, these are just a few of the peer reviewed papers I can reference. I have more on demand:  Huber and Knutti (2011): 'Even for a reconstruction with high variability in total irradiance, solar forcing contributed only about 0.07'C (0.03-0.13'C) to the warming since 1950.'  Erlykin 2009: 'We deduce that the maximum recent increase in the mean surface temperature of the Earth which can be ascribed to solar activity is 14% of the observed global warming.'  Benestad 2009: 'Our analysis shows that the most likely contribution from solar forcing a global warming is 7 ' 1% for the 20th century and is negligible for warming since 1980.'  Lockwood 2008: 'It is shown that the contribution of solar variability to the temperature trend since 1987 is small and downward; the best estimate is -1.3% and the 2? confidence level sets the uncertainty range of -0.7 to -1.9%.'  Mars  Con appeals to the work of Khabibullo Abdusamatov (12):  'Abdussamatov claims that 'global warming results not from the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, but from an unusually high level of solar radiation and a lengthy'almost throughout the last century'growth in its intensity.'[4] This view contradicts the mainstream scientific opinion on climate change as well as accepted reconstructions of solar activity.[5][6][7] He has asserted that 'parallel global warmings'observed simultaneously on Mars and on Earth'can only be a straightline consequence of the effect of the one same factor: a long-time change in solar irradiance.'[8] This assertion has not been accepted by the broader scientific community, some of whom have stated that 'the idea just isn't supported by the theory or by the observations' and that it 'doesn't make physical sense.'[9][10]'  The above article puts it mildly about him being not widely accepted. He has zero papers published in peer review journals, he is a mathematician and astrophysicist ' not climatologist ' and is a well known cuckoo on CC denier lists. He is not even part of the mere 24 articles out of 13,950 peer reviewed articles on climate change between 1991-2012 that reject global warming (13), not that it would help his case much for as it is so delightfully put: 'Of one thing we can be certain: had any of these [24 peer reviewed] articles presented the magic bullet that falsifies human-caused global warming, that article would be on its way to becoming one of the most-cited in the history of science.'  But to tackle the actual Mars claim, let's again look at what the experts are saying (14):  'The Sun's energy output has not increased since direct measurements began in 1978 (see Climate myth special: Global warming is down to the Sun, not humans). If increased solar output really was responsible, we should be seeing warming on all the planets and their moons, not just Mars and Pluto.  One theory is that winds have recently swept some areas of Mars clean of dust, darkening the surface, warming the Red Planet and leading to further increases in windiness ' a positive feedback effect (see Dust blamed for warming on MarsMovie Camera).  There is a great deal of uncertainty, though. The warming could be a regional effect. And recent results from the thermal imaging system on the Mars Odyssey probe suggest that the polar cap is not shrinking at all, but varies greatly from one Martian year to the next, although the details have yet to be published.'  And also (15):  'Recently, there have been some suggestions that 'global warming' has been observed on Mars (e.g. here). These are based on observations of regional change around the South Polar Cap, but seem to have been extended into a 'global' change, and used by some to infer an external common mechanism for global warming on Earth and Mars (e.g. here and here). But this is incorrect reasoning and based on faulty understanding of the data.'  Thus, the Mars claims must also be considered thoroughly discounted. </t>
<h> This assertion has not been accepted by the broader scientific community, some of whom have stated that 'the idea just isn't supported by the theory or by the observations' and that it 'doesn't make physical sense.'</h>

    <t>I would like to thank JonMilne for this great debate. I. The Sun My opponent is misrepresenting the evidence when he says that solar activity has dropped while temperatures have increased. As this article explains: 'The cycles in the late 20th [century] were short, ~10 years, and high compared to the long term average of ~40 SSN. The minima between them were short too. So although they did reduce in absolute amplitude after the '50s, they made up for it by kicking out more energy more of the time.'[1][2] Here is a graph showing sunspot activity over the last 1000 years: [3] Notice how sunspots were more numerous during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), less numerous during the Little Ice Age (LIA), and another 'hockey stick' forms at the start of the 20th century. What a coincidence.  A better way to look at the solar influence on climate is to look at a new statistic. Between raw solar activity (solar irradiance) and temperature, temperature lags about 7.5-10 years behind solar irradiance because of the heat capacity of the oceans. A better representation of the sun/temperature correlation is the length of the solar cycle. 'This new parameter not only indicated a remarkably high correlation coefficient between solar activity and temperature (on the order of 0.95), but it also eliminated the problem of the 7-year lag encountered by Reid.'[4][5][6] This is a close-up of the above graph: [6] Notice how solar activity falls around 1990, which, after 7.5-10 years (1999 to be exact) is manifested in a slight temperature drop.  Further, here is a graph showing solar irradiance itself compared to temperature: [9] While here is temperature compared with sunspot cycle length: [10] The correlation coefficent increases from 0.57 to 0.95, which are both greater than CO2's correlation of 0.44 (0 is no correlation, 1 is total correlation).  When looking at all of how the sun affects the climate: 'For example, the authors of a paper by NASA's JPL remark '...has compared the minimum aa [index of geomagnetic activity] values with the Earth's surface temperature record and found a correlation of 0.95 between the two data sets starting in 1885. The solar irradiance [solar activity] proxy developed from the aa minima continues to track the Earth's surface temperature until the present.''[7][8] In other words, using the better formulation produces an almost perfect correlation between solar activity and temperature. 'If the Scafetta and West analysis used the uncontaminated satellite data since 1980, the results would show that the Sun has contributed at least 75% of the global warming of the last century.''In particular, a quasi-60-year large cycle is quite evident since 1650 in all climate and astronomical records herein studied ... The existence of a natural 60-year cyclical modulation of the global surface temperature induced by astronomical mechanisms, by alone, would imply that at least 60 to 70% of the warming observed since 1970 has been naturally induced.'[6][11][12]  II. Extraterrestrial Bodies While yes, that particular study focused on the south pole of Mars, the whole planet is indeed warming: 'A recent study shows that Mars is warming four times faster than the Earth. Mars is warming due to increased Sun activity, which increases dust storms. The study's authors led by Lori Fenton, a planetary scientist at NASA, says the dust makes the atmosphere absorb more heat causing a positive feedback. Surface air temperatures on Mars increased by 0.65 C (1.17 F) from the 1970s to the 1990s.'[6] Here is a list of just some of the solar system's reactions to increased solar activity:  Sun - Recent Activity Highest in 8000 Years [meaning it's not just the 11-year cycle] and magnetic field has decreased in size by 25% 300% increase in galactic dust entering solar system Mercury - magnetosphere experiencing significant increases Venus  - 2500% Increase in Green Glow Mars - Rapid Appearance of Clouds, Ozone and Up to 50% Erosion of Ice Features in one year alone Jupiter - Plasma Torus increasing and Jupiter's Disappearance of White Ovals since 1997, recent increase in storms Io - 'observing same changes -' 200% Increase in Density of Plasma Torus and Ionosphere 1000% Higher Europa - Much Brighter Than Expected Ganymede - 200% brighter Saturn's - Plasma Torus 1000% Denser andAurora First Seen in polar regions in recent years Uranus - featureless in 1996, now exhibiting huge storms since 1999 and markedly brighter in 2004 than in 1999 Neptune - 40% Brighter, Near Infrared Range 1996 - 2002 Triton - Severe atmospheric changes, warming Pluto - 300% increase in atmospheric pressure.[13]  In addition, here is hard evidence that the moon is warming: [14]Further, this shows the comparison between the Sun's, the Earth's, and Neptune's activity:     [6] It is clear that not only is Neptune warming, it is doing so in the same fashion as the Earth's temperature and the Sun's activity, indicating a correlation between the events that is not caused by CO2III. Other Arguments First, my opponent claims that tropospheric temperatures have not decreased. 'However, since January 2002, the temperatures have been declining at 0.16 C/decade for UAH and 0.24 C/decade for the RSS data.' This graph shows two analyses of Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) satellite temperature measurement data (which is very reliable, compared to surface thermometers) of the troposphere over the tropics from 20 degrees North to 20 degrees South: [6] Second, my opponent claims that the oceans aren't cooling. However, 'Two separate studies through NASA confirm that since 2003, the world's oceans have been losing heat.'[15] Also, the PDO graph in R2 confirms this, as the PDO is going into a cool cycle.  Third, my opponent claims that the hockey stick is reliable. I touched on this more in R3, but I will add this: 'They used a computer model to draw the graph from the data, but two Canadians [Ross McKitrick and Stephen McIntyre] later found that the model almost always drew hockey-sticks even if they fed in random, electronic 'red noise' because it used a faulty algorithm.' The MBH 1998 report was never properly peer reviewed before the IPCC used it in their publications.'[6][16]Conclusion  The AGW theory makes several incorrect predictions, and the Earth's warming correlates with solar actiivty, not CO2.</t>

    <t>First of all, I don't approve of the people that know the advantages of going green and choose to ignore it. I can understand when someone isn't educated. Also, the crowd that chooses to block all advances into green tech by saying "global warming isn't real" had better really look into the advantages of green tech. You may have noticed that this is under the "Money" category, which is it's right place to be.            The main advantage of going green (with the exception of saving the environment) is the amount of money it will save you. Now, initially, buying green technology is more expensive than other, more non-green, options. This is usually the case. Why would anyone buy a slightly more expensive item when you can get a similar item for less?           Ironically, savings. "Green" items almost always cost less than non-green items to use once installed. For example, say you run a business, which is large and is centered in a large building. You have good profits, but the energy bill really cuts deep into your wallet. Would you rather: A) Not pay to have anything installed, but have the large energy costs B)Pay for some insulation, and have smaller energy costs from then on If you picked A, you're probably Mr. Krabs or unintelligent, and if you picked B, you made the right choice. There are many ways to save on energy bills by using green tech.            You could use more effective insulation and put insulation where there isn't any, you could use LEDs (those swirly light bulbs are hazardous and require special disposal, I wouldn't recommend those), put in a solar water heater, use double-paned windows, use a solar light, or even go old-school and open a window instead of turning on the air conditioner. There are extreme measures, like installing a wind turbine, small hydro-electric generator, etc.           While going green may seem unnecessary and wasteful, it really isn't bad at all. While you can appease the environmental crowd, you would actually be making an economical choice and be helping yourself. Using a few green methods, you make your wallet fatter, and who doesn't like that?</t>

    <t>I thank my opponent for accepting my challenge.   It [Global Warming] is the greatest and most successful pseudoscientific fraud I have seen in my long life as a physicist -Harold Lewis   Billions of dollars are spent every year in Global Warming research, another typical money waste if you ask me. I do not believe the people behind it actuallyve in this pseudo-science, they are fabricating it, and fabrication this big is not just a 'scam', a fabrication this big wants to bring change. That change can range from a few political seats to some evo-fascism, something like what the UN's Agenda 21 would want.  Before I begin, ask yourself this question: What did the green movement accomplish? Collecting money? What is their biggest achievement? Does it involve getting mega-bucks? Why do 1-percenter green movement powerhouses own oil companies? Why is Al-Gore's carbon foot print sky high?   I do find global warming quite silly. It predicts that heat will flow from the atmosphere to the warmer ground. And this violates the second law of thermodynamics.    1-Statistics: Believe it or not, but statistics aren't on the Global Warming's side. The IPCC have been quite creative, but that ain't enough. I will get to it later. Sure, there aren't many statistics comparing human and natural sources for the GHGs, but which side he billions of dollars invested in order to prove something exists?  It is no secret that nature's GHGs dwarfs man-made GHGs. The chart is accurate enough. Currently general agreement is that 95% of GHG (Greenhouse Gases) are caused by water vapor, and 99.999% of that is of natural origin. We can do little about it.        The claim is: We are disturbing natural balance of the 4.5 billion years old planet and it won't be able to take it due to it's pathetically fragile system. A large portation of this claim may only need a ninth grader to debunk it.   Water Vapour: How big a facor is water? I mean the percentage of water in the atmosphere gets change constantly but we don't witness change in the temperature.  There is a reason it is added list of GHGs. Water is really good at reflecting and absorbing light amp; radiations. In fact, it blows CO2 out of the water (no pun intended).  Collection of quotes admitting it. Bring me a source that claims CO2 have a better absorption ability than H2O. They imply that water have some kind of a cycle that makes CO2's effect bigger. Guess what? Water absorbs gasses, adding water to CO2 will create a vacuum. How do you think acid rains are created? How do you think sea creatures create shells? The effect is called 'Carbon Sink'. Read something about it. Simple experiment above.  Acid rains take between hours to days to form. Not HUNDREDS of years for the GHGs to FINALLY react to water. It is all simple science.  Try standing on a scale with an ant. Thats H2O against CO2. How does Global Warming pseudo-science explain that? I have no clue...     CO2:First thing you need to know is that carbon is at a State of Equilibrium. That is the point of natural cycles That is the basis of Carbon-14 dating method. If it increases in the atmosphere, there is acid rain. If it increases in oceans, there is sedimentation. And eventually, volcanoes will release the carbonate as CO2. It may even cause plants to reach their potential. Second of all, it is heavy:   CO2 Mol mass: 44.01 g per Mol CO2 Density: 1.96 KG/m3 Gravity: 1.5189  Air = 28 g per Mol Air Density : 1.2 KG/m3 Gravity: 1  H2O = 18 g per Mol H2O Density : 0.75 kg-m3 Gravity: 0.62   There is a reason there are no plants before there is no oxygen while climbing mountains. That is most of the CO2 is in oceans. Just look at the properties, it is a mess. I need an explanation of how CO2 can get from down here all the way up.  Where is the warming? There is no scientific proof that man-made CO2 causes global warming. Did the surface temperature warm yet? Oh! It didn’t.   The Venus argument: Might aswell mention it here. Other than being a logical fallacy with funny counter-examples. It is completely incorrect and based on false assumptions. If we use the IPCC’s (false) formula, CO2 may only heat it up by 38C, so how come it is hotter than Mercury and have a degree 482C? Because it is a different planet. Infact, CO2 may even cool the planet since Venus have 30-40Km thick clouds that blocks most of the sun’s radiation. That’s why there is little difference in heat between day and night in Venus. Venus have a very weak magnetic field, it takes the planet 246 days to rotate on it’s axis, so all the molten magma is not suppressed and the thousands of volcanoes goes ahoy.         2-What does What again? Global warming does whatever it feels likes. And I am not talking about the “scary” failed apocalypse prophecies. Global warming does everything! It makes ice melt, it makes ice thicken. Decide on something already! I might as well start a theory about “Global Cooling”… Ops… It was invented in the 70s… Lets cut the hypocrisy already…   Cow Fart-Gas gt; Human transportation GHG. So we should eat less meat! Heck, we should be like this woman. 3-The missing link: Contrary to the popular belief, evolution isn’t the only one in the manhunt.   According to geological ice sample study, the earth is in a period of cooling and warming.    #4   I am not a climate change denier (Ironic right?). There is nothing we can do against nature.     The recent history’s hottest period is 2000 years ago, which is before cigarettes were invented (So you may scratch that out as a cause). Whats that? I’d almost say humans have nothing to do with it. The world was NOT flooded back then, and it won’t start flooding now.         4-The trustworthy IPCC: Calling the IPCC trustworthy is a relative statement. But according to an average hillie billie’s standards, the IPCC is the furthest from “Trustworthy”. The IPCC does not even do research, the fact they have been caught faking so many times is enough.</t>

    <t>with the Co2 ppm it was 7000ppm in the Cambrian but it should be decreasing not increasing. 'Even if greenhouse emissions stopped overnight the concentrations already in the atmosphere would still mean a global rise of between 0.5 and 1C. A shift of a single degree is barely perceptible to human skin, but it's not human skin we're talking about. It's the planet; and an average increase of one degree across its entire surface means huge changes in climatic extremes.  Six thousand years ago, when the world was one degree warmer than it is now, the American agricultural heartland around Nebraska was desert. It suffered a short reprise during the dust- bowl years of the 1930s, when the topsoil blew away and hundreds of thousands of refugees trailed through the dust to an uncertain welcome further west. The effect of one-degree warming, therefore, requires no great feat of imagination.  'The western United States once again could suffer perennial droughts, far worse than the 1930s. Deserts will reappear particularly in Nebraska, but also in eastern Montana, Wyoming and Arizona, northern Texas and Oklahoma. As dust and sandstorms turn day into night across thousands of miles of former prairie, farmsteads, roads and even entire towns will be engulfed by sand.'  What's bad for America will be worse for poorer countries closer to the equator. It has beencalculated that a one-degree increase would eliminate fresh water from a third of the world's land surface by 2100. Again we have seen what this means. There was an incident in the summer of 2005: One tributary fell so low that miles of exposed riverbank dried out into sand dunes, with winds whipping up thick sandstorms. As desperate villagers looked out onto baking mud instead of flowing water, the army was drafted in to ferry precious drinking water up the river ' by helicopter, since most of the river was too low to be navigable by boat. The river in question was not some small, insignificant trickle in Sussex. It was the Amazon.  While tropical lands teeter on the brink, the Arctic already may have passed the point of no return. Warming near the pole is much faster than the global average, with the result that Arctic icecaps and glaciers have lost 400 cubic kilometres of ice in 40 years. Permafrost ' ground that has lain frozen for thousands of years ' is dissolving into mud and lakes, destabilising whole areas as the ground collapses beneath buildings, roads and pipelines. As polar bears and Inuits are being pushed off the top of the planet, previous predictions are starting to look optimistic. Earlier snowmelt means more summer heat goes into the air and ground rather than into melting snow, raising temperatures in a positive feedback effect. More dark shrubs and forest on formerly bleak tundra means still more heat is absorbed by vegetation.  Out at sea the pace is even faster. Whilst snow-covered ice reflects more than 80% of the sun's heat, the darker ocean absorbs up to 95% of solar radiation. Once sea ice begins to melt, in other words, the process becomes self-reinforcing. More ocean surface is revealed, absorbing solar heat, raising temperatures and making it unlikelier that ice will re-form next winter. The disappearance of 720,000 square kilometres of supposedly permanent ice in a single year testifies to the rapidity of planetary change. If you have ever wondered what it will feel like when the Earth crosses a tipping point, savour the moment.'  every 1 degree gained at the equator is 12 degrees gained at the poles  'the end of the world is nigh. A three-degree increase in global temperature ' possible as early as 2050 ' would throw the carbon cycle into reverse. Instead of absorbing carbon dioxide, vegetation and soils start to release it. So much carbon pours into the atmosphere that it pumps up atmospheric concentrations by 250 parts per million by 2100, boosting global warming by another 1.5C. In other words, the Hadley team had discovered that carbon-cycle feedbacks could tip the planet into runaway global warming by the middle of this century ' much earlier than anyone had expected. '  we may be only 3.5% of the problem with our output but our output is also making nature output more by 2100 north America will have the same water problem as Africa war will break out for the last bits of fresh water  with the water rising they measure the water level at the equator and water flows from the equator to the poles and water is rising 7m there. Rome is in danger of flooding. </t>

    <t>Please note that my opponent have failed to respond to any of my arguments or challenges, I gave him the option to defend and create arguments against different aspects of criticism on Global Warming, and yet. We still have the Co2 weight problem, the thermodynamic laws problem, the water vapor percentage and absorption problem, the history problem, the fraud problem, the corruption problem. Cramming those up objections against the theory and putting them aside, like our friend here did, shows failure to respond and defend. Which brings us to these annoying emotional argument.And you want the Co2 ppm to get lower than this? You do realize plants can't preform photosynthesis with 150-200 Co2 ppm right? I'd say the concentration is quite balanced since there is no gument that the current Co2 concentration is harmful.1-Law of thermodynamics:1- The warm earth surface radiates heat to the cooler atmosphere.2- The cool body (uphysically) re-radiates the heat it got back to the warm body.3- This continuous process's net result causes the warmer body to become warmer. The earth is not an isolated system, the earth is not flat. The cooling happens at night, the rate of 240 W/m^2 is not going to change because of 0.000390 Co2. Just bring me one thermodynamic text that mentions 'Back/reflected heat radiations', it is impossible for a cooler body to warm the source of it's heat.It is true that all bodies releases radiations, but the earth surface's radiation is 10 times stronger than the atmosphere's radiation. Result: The earth cools, not get 11 times the atmosphere's radiations back.2-Co2 weight: CO2 Mol mass: 44.01 g per Mol CO2 Density: 1.96 KG/m3 Gravity: 1.5189  Air = 28 g per Mol Air Density : 1.2 KG/m3 Gravity: 1  H2O = 18 g per Mol H2O Density : 0.75 kg-m3 Gravity: 0.62 Gravity is almost constant at your everyday heights. What I want to know is how Co2 is going to get down here all the way to the atmosphere. Why do ocean hold the majority of Co2? 3-Absorption. Water absorption infrared radiations MUCH more than Co2, how can GW be man-made if such a thing exists?Not to mention that it is 24,400 ppm.I was planning to watch a horror movie soon, but what the hell. I have that article Con copy pasted. *Brings popcorn*===We first kick it off with a temperature lie. Nice try associating a weather extreme to GW, I mean they never existed in the past n'all... Oh wait...The second paragraph is so full of logical fallacies.According to the Overseas Development Institute, Finland was covered by broadleaf forests 6000 years ago. Therefore, I conclude that an increase in 1C is going to fill the earth with forests! Point?The author pretty much admits that Anthropogenic climate change doesn't exist here. And nice of him to point out that this article is solely based on imagination amp; lala land fantasy.*Fictional Scenario Begins*!Omg! The Amazon flooded! Nature extreme! GLOBAL WARMING! Oh wait... That is the opposite of the article... Does this mean it is GLOBAL COOLING! 1/3 of fresh water will freeze! The end is nigh!I am not too sure about 'no return'. It shrinks and then... Grows right up! Maybe GW is taking breaks?The Polar bears trick is still being used? Wicked. Who cares about what water absorbs, there is man-made Co2! And wow! I never knew the heat water absorbs become sustainable!Humans sheds 4 kilograms of skins per year! OMG we are dying!Yay! An other Global Warming/Cooling dooms day prophecy!. And by Hadley you mean the center that leaked the climate gate emails?I love how he mentioned Rome. Why just Rome? He wants to band Catholics in order to protect the Vatican or something? lol.Global Warming have none, zero, nada proof.

Leave the guy alone with the mega-bucks he earned, his oil company, and his gigantic carbon footprint.The Co2 ppm is meaningless until you explain how Co2 does Global Warming. For example, during the Cambrian period, Co2 ppm was 18 times higher than today, the 7000 ppm did not invent Venus #2.The early graphs of Co2 increase are a fraud, they doctored and selected data to make a scary graph. If you don't start a graph from a zero, it will look sharp.The glacier bubbles will have a lower concentration of Co2. Not only do Global Warming alarmists defend the manipulated graphs, but they also claim that the Co2 level never rose above 300ppm for x0,000 years. But oops, fossils records proves you wrong. How did the Co2 increase that much without humans?. Please show me how Co2 beats H2O.How possibly can we cause a change of 350% by the end of the century when we only contribute a tiny 3.5% of the Co2? Is nature excluded?How come BILLIONS of dollars are spent in order to PROVE something proved?Because that thing was NEVER proved.Is that the best result they could come up with? 0.12 Fahrenheit? OMG a disaster!Dude... The earth was 20 Fahrenheit warmer than that... The earth did not flood...Glaciers are melting and thickening. As for the sea level, it is a myth (like global warming!). 1/3 of Netherlands rises above sea level! That's an other IPCC mistake. The IPPC also added the area that could be venerable to flooding, that way the statistics would look more scary.Listen... When the first island sinks, give me a call.The sunscreen was a nice touch (Assuming it was invented millions of years ago), I like the use of the word 'Have'. People don't Have to wear sunscreen, people choose to wear sunscreen.I also would like you to confront the political (And commercial?) aspect of Global Warming.Are people doing this to make money? Why do oil companies love GW policies? Why are people behind it getting richer rather than doing something useful about pollution? All that money is getting on the pockets of con artists, people keep buying expensive green products, but that is not science.The fact that the GW movement was caught making frauds is enough to remove any legitimacy to superficial reports.</t>

    <t>I would like tothank Citrakayah for presenting his arguments. Before I begin my rebuttals, I would like to confirm that I deny the existance of short-term (i.e. right now) global warming. (NOTE: Unfortunately, the graphs feature won't work. Public HealthMy opponent is working on a hypothetical here – that just because global warming is happening means that tropical disease rates will increase. However, as I have shown, over the next few decades, temperatures should decrease, meaning a 'decrease' in tropical disease rates. But even if the planet was warming, there shouldn’t be a cause for concern over higher disease rates. Over the last century, tropical disease rates have not correlated with global warming. Take, for example, malaria. Rates of malaria have decreased (or were marginally affected) in almost all locations around the globe, even as temperatures have risen (Graph 1; [1]).The fact is that malaria does not really care about temperature. When the world was cooler during the 'Little Ice Age', malaria was far more rampant than it ever has been today. Even though the Earth has warmed in the 20th century, tropical disease rates are at all time lows.[2] Really, these diseases aren’t tropical. Even in the 20th century, Archangel, Russia was having 10,000+ deaths from malaria.[3] The correlation just isn’t there. Science reports that the supposed correlation between tropical disease and global warming is 'purely speculative'.[4][5] 'A warm climate is a necessary condition for the mosquitoes that can carry malaria and dengue fever but is not a sufficient condition for the diseases to become epidemic.'[2] What really causes epidemics is improper regulations and poverty. For example, in Peru, when water chlorination was banned, cholera cases skyrocketed. In Sri Lanka, when DDT was banned, malaria cases skyrocketed. Or take Singapore and Malaysia. They are in the same general location, but Singapore had zero malaria deaths and Malaysia had 36853 cases of it.[3] It is clear that tropical disease rates correlate with improper regulations and poverty, not global warming. As for the increased amount of heat waves, more heat is actually beneficial, as I mentioned in the last round. In Germany, heat waves have actually been shown to reduce mortality rates, while cold spells significantly increase them.[6][7] For the UK, 'For the UK, the Keatinge studies show heat-related deaths caused by global warming will increase by 2,000. But cold-related deaths will decrease by 20,000.'[8] Global warming will save more than it will kill.II. Sea Level Rise  Even though some groups like to show scenes of global apocalypse with this, the truth is that the sea level hasn’t risen that much. However, both past and predicted rise have been greatly exaggerated (Graph 2; [10]). The linear trend shows a sea level rise of only 1.31 +/- 0.30 mm/year. 'The Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory estimates the rate of sea level rise at 1.42 plus or minus 0.14 mm/year for the period 1954 to 2003. This is less than the estimate of 1.91 plus or minus 0.14 mm/year for the period 1902 to 1953, indicating a slowing of the rate.'[9][10] That’s an increase of around 2.8 inches in the last 50 years – not that much of an apocalyptic scenario.Future sea level predictions are even better. As of currently, global ocean heat content has not changed in recent years (Graph 3; [11]). Sea level itself has actually been declining for the last decade (Graph 4; [10]).The ‘INQUA Commission on Sea-Level Change and Coastal Evolution’ led by Dr. Morner, prepared as estimate that the global sea level will rise 10 cm plus or minus 10 cm in the next 100 years. Dr. Morner has since revised his estimate to 5 cm per 100 years after considering data of the Sun activity suggesting that the warming trend may have ended and the Earth may be headed into a cooling trend.”[10][12][13] That’s around 2.5 inches in the next 100 years. That’s really not too bad.  As for Tuvalu, sea level has actually dropped four inches in the last 20 years and there is no evidence based on the observations that sea level rise there is accelerating.[13][14]In general, there is no cause for concern here.III. Ocean AcidificationFears here are also greatly exaggerated. The mean drop in pH levels as a result of CO2 increases is around 0.3, but the sea can experience changes of almost 1.4 in as little as just a day. 'On a monthly scale the pH varies by 0.024 to 1.430 pH units.' 'At Puerto Morelos (in Mexico’s easternmost state, on the Yucatán Peninsula) the pH varied as much as 0.3 units per hour due to groundwater springs.' 'Even the more stable and vast open ocean is not a fixed pH all year round. Hofmann writes that 'Open-water areas (in the Southern Ocean) experience a strong seasonal shift in seawater pH (~0.3–0.5 units) between austral summer and winter.''[15][16]  This is the paper's hypothesis: 'This natural variability has prompted the suggestion that an appropriate null hypothesis may be, until evidence is obtained to the contrary, that major biogeochemical processes in the oceans other than calcification will not be fundamentally different under future higher CO2/lower pH conditions'[15][16]In addition, increased CO2 levels can help shell formation: “We also know that adding CO2 in a sense is feeding the calcifying organisms (like it feeds life above the water too). CO2 dissolves as bicarbonate, which marine uses to make skeletons and shells from. So yes, a lower pH dissolves shells, but the extra CO2 increases shell formation.'[17][16]  In general, increased CO2 concentrations don't affect pH levels any more than pH levels change on a daily basis. They can even help in the production of shells.  IV. Cloud Forests First, cloud forests, and specifically, the one my opponent cites, the Monteverde cloud forests, are not being affected by global warming. In the case of the Monteverde cloud forest, it was the clearing of the lowland forests under the cloud forest that changed the pattern of cloud formation, not warming. In fact, the cloud forests in nearby Nicaragua were unaffected because there was no lowland deforestation. Deforestation, not warming, caused changes in the cloud forests.[7][21]Now on to drought affects. Drought frequency, in the face of warming, has not increased over the past 100 years (Graph 5; [10]). The US has not gotten any drier in the last 100 years. Pederson et al. found that droughts during the end of the Little Ice Age were more severe and of longer duration than those of the 20th and 21st centuries. Cooler climates produced more extreme conditions in many parts of the world. Woodhouse et al. published a 1,200 year perspective of Southwestern North America droughts: 'The medieval period was characterized by widespread and regionally severe, sustained drought... Proxy data documenting drought indicate centuries-long periods of increased aridity across the central and western U.S...The recent drought, thus far, pales hydrologically in comparison.'[18][19][10] Droughts tend to coincide with periods of high solar activity, so since solar activity is decreasing, drought frequency should decrease further. In fact, increased heat means more precipitation, as more moisture evaporates from the oceans and then falls as rain or snow. NASA says global rainfall increased 2 percent in the 20th century compared with the tail-end of the Little Ice Age in the 19th century. Most of the increased moisture fell in the mid and high latitudes where much of the world’s most productive cropland is located. This should continue as time goes on.[20][13] Conclusion Most of the problems my opponent highlights are greatly exaggerated, and since I have shown that temperatures should increase only slightly in the long-term, they should not be of any concern over the next few centuries.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank Citrakayah for accepting this debate. I. Natural Factors Point to Little or No Change In The Climate I.A. The SunThe sun is the main driver of the global climate. The level of activity from the sun correlates with the average global temperature. The sun is currently decreasing in activity, meaning that the warming of the 1970s-1990s will soon be erased. 'Changes in the Sun can account for major climate changes on Earth for the past 300 years, including part of the recent surge of global warming.'[1] The sun can account for most of the warming experienced over the past century, and correlates well with the rising and falling of temperatures when compared to 20th century temperatures:  [2]I.A.1. Solar Flux PredictionsSolar activity has been declining for a little over a decade and will continue to do so for at least the foreseeable future. ''Normally, the conveyor belt moves about 1 meter per second—walking pace,' says Hathaway, 'That's how it has been since the late 19th century.' In recent years, however, the belt has decelerated to 0.75 m/s in the north and 0.35 m/s in the south. 'We've never seen speeds so low.''[19] This means that solar activity has been declining recently. The next solar cycle, number 25, is projected to be one of the lowest in centuries.[19] 'Storms from the sun are expected to build to a peak in 2013 or so, but after that, the long-range indicators are pointing to an extended period of low activity — or even hibernation.'[3] In fact, we are already beginning to experience this lowered solar activity.[5][6]This graph illustrates the recent decline in solar activity. Note the downward trend in solar activity overtime:  [4]With solar activity leveling off, temperatures will go back down to normal. In addition, there will be fewer hazardous rays coming from the sun and fewer solar storms, meaning fewer disruptions to the satellite systems we rely on so heavily. I.A.2. Cosmic Ray FluxWith decreased solar activity, there is increased cosmic ray penetration of the Earth's atmosphere. Cosmic rays are inversely proportional to solar activity and proportional to cloud cover; and greater cloud cover means cooler temperatures.[19][10][11] I.A.3. Ocean Currents Ocean currents are the main internal drivers of the global climate. They have an R-squared correlation of 0.83, which is pretty significant (the highest score is 1).[7] Here is a chart showing ocean current's correlation to temperatures:   [7] The sun is the main driver of ocean current temperatures, 'This [solar activity] is the single most important cause [of ocean currents and their temperatures]. The Sun provides the bulk of the energy which drives the circulation of water in the oceans, either directly or indirectly (through winds). The uneven distribution of solar energy across the globe (highest at the equator, decreasing towards the poles) produces an uneven heating of water in the ocean.'[20] When plotted together, solar activity and ocean current activity correlate well (notice the decline in solar activity after WWII, and the subsequent fall in ocean current activity around the same time).[2][7][8]Ocean currents, because of the sun's cooling and because of its natural three-decade cycles of warm and cool, ocean currents are projected to cool down further than today and to continue that pattern for at least another few decades. 'Because PDO cycles last 25 to 30 years, Easterbrook expects the cooling trend to continue for another 2 decades or so.'[9] Here is a graph showing ocean current's temperatures since 1900:     [8]Note how all three currents are experiencing decreasing temperature trends, which, due to their current short duration, should continue for at least two more decades, and then another few decades to get back (possibly) to a peak. With decreased solar activity causing lower ocean current temperatures, the Earth will cool somewhat over at least the next few decades, albeit it shouldn't be that much. The climate will stay around normal. I.B. The 1500-Year CycleThere exists a 1500-year climatic cycle of peak-trough-peak (or vice versa) temperature cycles. 'Through at least the last million years, a moderate 1500-year warm-cold cycle has been superimposed over the longer, stronger Ice Ages and warm interglacials.'[12]Here is an illustration of this cycle:  [13] This warm trend is projected to continue for around a few more centuries, and then the cycle will flip into a cold pattern.[12] This warm period will help counterbalance some of the effects of a diminishing sun. As solar activity does its ups and downs, the counterbalance between the Earth and the Sun will help keep Earth's climate systems in check. The various natural factors contributed by solar activity and the Earth's 1500-year cycle point to an insignificant change in the Earth's climate. Temperatures should not be much higher or lower than they usually are on average over the next few centuries. While the sun is cooling, the Earth will continue to heat the planet somewhat until solar activity returns and we have another temperature rise. It's a rise-and-fall situation.II. Positive Effects of the Current Interglacial and Warm PeriodA moderately warm period is better than a cold period. If the temperature is not too warm, a warm climate can have positive effects on both the Earth as a whole and on everyone. II.A. Health EffectsIn moderation, warm temperatures are better for the body than cold temperatures. People cannot get enough heat, infections are rampant, and hospital admissions will rise in the cold. From 1979 to 1997, extreme cold killed roughly twice as many Americans as heat waves [coincidentally when the Earth was heating up].[14][12] In Germany, heat waves were found to reduce overall mortality rates slightly, while cold spells led to a significant increase in deaths.[15][12] In addition, warmer weather decreases incidences of strokes, respiratory diseases, and the flu.[12]In general, life expectancies are higher in warmer climates, and there are fewer incidences of disease and other health problems. A warm period would be beneficial to human health. II.B. Economic BenefitsSome of the major industrial sectors, particularly agriculture, tend to work better in a warmer environment than they do in a cooler environment. 'The book [The Impact of Climate Change] finds that a moderate warming will have a positive economic impact on the agriculture and forestry sectors. Since carbon dioxide is used by plants to capture and store energy, there may be a fertilizing effect as levels of the gas rise. This, combined with longer growing seasons, fewer frosts and more precipitation, among other factors, could benefit some economic sectors.'[16][17]CO2 increases, a byproduct of temperature increases ([12]), naturally help to stimulate plant growth as well, further helping agriculture. 'For a 300 ppm increase in the atmosphere's CO2 concentration above the planet's current base level of slightly less than 400 ppm, for example, the productivity of earth's herbaceous plants rises by something on the order of 30%, while the productivity of its woody plants rises by something on the order of 50%.'[18][21]This further helps humans by increasing food yields, lowering rates of starvation and hunger. Conclusion There should be an insignificant change in the climate over the next couple of centuries as the sun continues its cycles and the Earth is in a moderately warm period. In the short term, the major factors in the climate show a decrease in temperature, but the long term shows a stabilization of temperatures to a reasonably warm level. This increases humans' life expectancies and increases crop yields, reducing the incidence of hunger, thereby further aiding in the increases in life expectancies. There is no rational reason to worry about the climate going off the deep end in the near future. On the contrary, our current climatic state seems to be helping us.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank Citrakayah for this great debate. I. Natural Factors Point to Little or No Change in Climate I.A. The Sun  My opponent claims that solar activity has diverged from temperatures since the 1980s. He, however, is making an incorrect conclusion.  Between raw solar activity (solar irradiance) and temperature, temperature lags about 7.5-10 years behind solar irradiance because of the heat capacity of the oceans. A better representation of the sun/temperature correlation is the length of the solar cycle. 'This new parameter not only indicated a remarkably high correlation coefficient between solar activity and temperature (on the order of 0.95), but it also eliminated the problem of the 7-year lag encountered by Reid.'[1][2][3] When looking at all of how the sun affects the climate: 'For example, the authors of a paper by NASA's JPL remark '...has compared the minimum aa [index of geomagnetic activity] values with the Earth's surface temperature record and found a correlation of 0.95 between the two data sets starting in 1885. The solar irradiance [solar activity] proxy developed from the aa minima continues to track the Earth's surface temperature until the present.''[4][5] In other words, using the better formulation produces an almost perfect correlation between solar activity and temperature.  'If the Scafetta and West analysis used the uncontaminated satellite data since 1980, the results would show that the Sun has contributed at least 75% of the global warming of the last century.'[6][7] That is at least how much the sun has contributed to recent warming.  I.A.1 Solar Flux Predictions 'From all that, for Solheim’s predicted temperature decline of 0.9º C over the whole of Solar Cycle 24 to be achieved, the decline from mid-2013 will be 1.2º C on average over the then remaining twelve and a half years of the cycle. No doubt the cooling will be back-loaded, making the further decline predicted over Solar Cycle 25 relative to Solar Cycle 24 more readily achievable.'[8] Solar activity is expected to decline, and as a result of that, so is temperature. I.A.2. Cosmic Ray FluxCosmic rays cause cloud formation: 'Preliminary results show that these faux cosmic rays indeed have an effect on the atmosphere: When high energy protons stream in, production of nanometer-sized particles in the atmosphere increases by more than ten times.'[9]  More clouds causes global cooling: 'Cloud cover has decreased over the past 39 years globally, and temperatures have risen during that time. This global decrease in cloud cover alone could account for all surface warming observed since the 1970s.'[10]  The change in cloudiness corresponds to the change in climate: 'A scarcity of muons can be linked to elevated global temperatures by a reduction in low cloud cover and low cloudiness was indeed at a minimum around 1992-93.'[11][12]  Cosmic rays cause cloud formation which cools the planet. As solar activity decreases, cosmic ray penetration will increase, thereby increasing cloud formation and cooling the planet. I.A.3. Ocean Currents It is when we look at the oceans that we see a clearer pattern between solar activity and temperature. Because the oceans have an enormous heat storage capacity, it takes several years for a warming of the oceans to be transmitted to the surface (hence the 8 year lag in solar activity and air temperatures). Solar activity and ocean currents correlate directly.[13]  'Current research also shows that Earth's oceans are now beginning to cool. It is also now clear that temperatures over the last century correlate far better with cycles in oceans than they do with carbon dioxide; and, the temperature cycles in oceans are caused by cycles of the sun.'[14]  The oceans have already flipped into a cool cycle, as I mentioned, because of the decrease in solar activity. I.B. The 1500-Year Cycle  These are global events. Take, for example, the Medieval Warm Period. Various temperature estimates say that locations as far flung as Greenland, Africa, New Zealand, and South America reported temperatures 1-4 degrees C above their current temperatures. Not only is the Medieval Warming seen. A Vostok Glacier ice core revealed the 1500 year cycle over 400,000 years, and correlates with glacial movement all over the globe, and at the same time. The same goes with seabed data.[15]  Overall, 'Based on this, the Earth is about 150 years into a moderate Modern Warming that will last a few centuries longer. It will essentially restore the fine climate of the Medieval Climate Optimum.”[15] This cycle coincidences with the increase in temperature. II. Positive Effects of the Current Interglacial and Warm Period II.A. Health Benefits Actually, 'The only global study suggests that this is true internationally: by 2050, there will be almost 400,000 more heat-related deaths a year, and almost 1.8 million fewer cold-related deaths. Warmer temperatures will save 1.4 million lives each year. The number of saved lives will outweigh the increase in heat-related deaths until at least 2200.'[16]  Yes, while it is easier to make fire than an air conditioner, heat is, overall, better for the body than cold (to a point). People in the Middle East are healthier (when controlled, that is) than people in, say, Siberia. What my opponent cites is not an increase in deaths from warming per se, but in temperature variability: 'The claim that warming increases morbidity rates is a myth. This isn't the case, according to Dr. Robert Mendelsohn, an environmental economist from Yale University. Mendelsohn argues that heat-stress deaths are caused by temperature variability and not warming. Those deaths grow in number not as climates warm but as the variability in climate increases.'[17]  Overall, if temperatures rose 2.5 degrees Celsius, deaths in the United States from respiratory diseases such as pneumonia and influenza, diseases of the circulatory system and even infectious diseases would drop by about 40,000 per year. Warming might reduce medical costs by about $20 billion annually.[18][19] II.B. Economic Benefits Con­sequently, the more CO2 there is in the air, the better plants grow, as has been demonstrated in literally thousands of laboratory and field experiments. As a result, the amount of carbon gained per unit of water lost per unit leaf area —or water-use efficiency—increases dramatically as the air’s CO2 content rises; and this phenomenon has been well documented in CO2 enrichment experiments with agricultural crops. In addition, CO2 concentration increases make plants hardier against dangers such as UV radiation and soil salinity. And finally, health promoting substances found in various food crops and medicinal plants have been shown to benefit from rising atmospheric CO2.[20] (Other sources to studies in that link)  Overall, increased CO2 concentrations help plants a lot more than hurt them. Plants feed on CO2, and more of it should make plants better. Conclusion This is a version of next century’s climate forecast using the information I provided:  Built in cooling trend until at least 2024 Temperature Hadsst3 moving average anomaly 2035 - 0.15 Temperature Hadsst3 moving average anomaly 2100 – 0.5 General Conclusion – by 2100 all the 20th century temperature rise will have been reversed.[21][22]  The next few centuries should see temperatures go up slightly, albeit with fluctuations in between by the climate contributors I provided. Health effects should be positive as a slight warming and increased CO2 concentrations increase agricultural production and optimal plant temperature (corresponding to the slight increase in temperatures). Climate change is not an imminent danger.</t>
<h>    It is also now clear that temperatures over the last century correlate far better with cycles in oceans than they do with carbon dioxide; and, the temperature cycles in oceans are caused by cycles of the sun.'</h>

    <t>Right, last round my sources had a problem, but I’ve reposted them in the comments section.I thank my opponent for the fantastic debate, and may the best arguments win.C1: Public HealthFirst, I’d like to note that Pro hasn’t addressed my points about dengue fever or yellow fever.To argue that infections decrease in warming periods misses the fact that over the past century or so we’ve made significant strides in treatments for tropical diseases such as malaria, as well as in fighting mosquito outbreaks[cite]. My argument is that all things being equal, an increase in temperature results in an increase in the spread of mosquito-born diseases. The fact that malaria can survive outside of the tropics is rather incidental to whether or not it is more virulent in the tropics. Pro concludes that since malaria rates have decreased over time, and it has happened outside the tropics, malaria would not be affected by global warming.The problem with this is that malaria rates (and pretty much every other tropical disease rate) responds to whatever’s forcing it, just like climate. Keep your temperature steady and leave standing water everywhere and you get more malaria. Kill mosquitos and keep everything else constant and malaria rates drop.We know that malaria is more virulent in warmer areas[1]. Therefore, as the world warms, we either are faced with an increase in malaria cases or have to expand our public health infrastructure to prevent them from occurring in the first place. The first can result in an increase in deaths, the second would have to be very well planned to avoid all deaths and would still result in economic damages. Ergo, we can conclude that a warming world presents risk.As far as heat deaths, this data may be true for the UK and Germany, but it is not necessarily true universally. Many low-income areas are in hot areas rather than cold ones, so quite conceivably that could cause there to still be a net increase in fatalities.C2: Sea Level RiseI don’t argue for an apocalypse where the ocean rises twenty feet.First I’d like to note that Tuvalu has an average elevation of about six feet above sea level. The highest point is fifteen feet[2]. So it doesn’t necessarily take much to cause damage. Also, there are waves, and tides, so even if a given area would still be above average sea level, that doesn’t mean it won’t get water damage.Secondly, sea level rise isn’t going to be constant everywhere. This is due to a variety of factors, such as the gravitational pull of the Earth being slightly different in different locations, temperature variations, and tectonic plates[3].Unfortunately for Tuvalu, it sits in what is probably the most unfortunate location a bunch of low-level coral atolls could[4]. Sea level in Tuvalu rises about three times as fast as in other locations[5].About 2.8 inches could matter quite a bit for an island that’s about six feet above sea level when one accounts for the fact that for them it could quite possibly be more in the range of 8 inches.This same reasoning can be applied to other locations. Brazil is close to an area that has a higher sea level[6].As to Pro’s claim that sea level is falling, the only thing that his source says that supports that is that the level fell slightly in one specific area in Western Canada, by .5 mm. That is hardly a global sea level drop, and satellite data confirms that sea level is rising[7].C3: Ocean AcidificationThat same paper cited concedes that calcification would be adversely impacted. As calcifying organisms are an essential part of the food chain, this doesn’t do much to dismiss my claim that ocean acidification poses a risk.In relation to the claim that increased carbon dioxide could be beneficial to shells, experiments with increased concentrations of carbon dioxide in seawater where shells are growing refute that. Shell dissolution is far more affected than shell calcification[8], in any event.While it’s true that pH isn’t fixed in the ocean, that doesn’t mean that shifting the whole range of pH values downwards, towards the more acidic end of the scale, would necessarily be acceptable. If I’m adapted to survive climates of 10-20 degrees Celsius, and it shifts upwards two or three degrees, I’m experiencing significant environmental stress. Since a drop in pH of one (say, from four to three) is a tenfold increase, since pH is a logarithmic scale, the problem with pH is even bigger.C4: Cloud ForestsIt’s true that Lawton’s paper shows that deforestation is having a significant effect on the cloud forests. It would be a mistake, however, to conclude from this that global warming has no effect. Modeling has demonstrated that increases in carbon dioxide would indeed affect the cloud forests[9]. Obviously deforestation has an effect to, as does general land use, but it can’t be gathered from the fact that damage to the cloud forests is caused by multiple factors that global warming has no effect.It is true that precipitation, in some regions, increases due to global warming. And it’s true that worse droughts have happened in the past. However, I must ask my opponent: Would you prefer a severe drought that is less severe than a massive drought that caused widespread damage, or would you prefer no drought at all? As Pro’s own source points out, droughts that are accompanied by warmer temperatures impact the environment more.Furthermore, global warming alters air circulation patterns, causing the distribution of moisture to change[11]. Even if all else remains equal, certain parts are going to get drier and other parts will get wetter--which has the potential for negative consequences, as noted in my source. For instance, recent droughts in the Sahel are expected to increase in severity due to global warming.Conclusion:I’ve demonstrated that the evidence points towards global warming not being due to the Sun—while I haven’t demonstrated that humans caused global warming, I don’t really need to. Given that the equations that are the current scientific consensus about how to predict warming match up with real observations, we can reasonably conclude that they are correct.Meanwhile, I’ve shown that any economic or health benefits from a warming world would be far outweighed by the costs—ocean acidification, sea level rise, loss of cloud forests, increase in heat stroke deaths, and spread of several virulent diseases. </t>

    <t>I.A. The Sun:  Well, I have no argument with saying that the Sun is the main factor on climate. Without it we'd be freezing--below freezing, in fact. But that doesn't necessarily mean that it's the main factor causing climate change.  Since the Sun is, indeed, emitting less energy compared to what it used to, we're left with the question of why the globe is still warming (I'll get to his argument, the 1500 year cycle, later). The Sun's contribution to the temperature trend since the late 1980s is, actually, negative. Lockwood said in his 2008 paper 'Recent changes in solar outputs and the global mean surface temperature' that the best esitmate is -1.3% of the temperature rise, with uncertainty placing it in the range of -.7% to -1.9%[1]. Clearly the Sun can't be invoked to explain recent temperature rises, since it should be causing us to cool.  Further evidence that it isn't the Sun can be found in the fact that the equation where, to quote Lockwood: 'S is the solar input variation; V is the volcanic aerosal effect (quantified by the global mean atmospheric optical depth, AOD); ΔE is the anomaly of energy exchange between the deep ocean and the surface mixing layer (Willis et al. 2004), here quantified by the N3.4 ENSO index; L is a linear drift term to allow for anthropogenic grenhouse gas and aerosol emissions (and associated feedbacks); and kE, kV and kS are the appropriate weighting (sensitivity factors).'  In plain English, that means that the equation is the result of what we think we know about how climate works, and was derived basically by combining a bunch of factors (including how sensitive we think the climate is to carbon dioxide/greenhouse gases--this is important) and seeing how we think that'll affect the climate. And as we see from the below graphic, it's not a bad prediction.  Recently, the predicted values are actually too low, which basically means that if anything we're current underestimating climatic sensitivity, or have missed a factor influencing climate.[1] Observed is blue, predicted is red.  Now, it is theoretically possible that the equation could still be completely wrong, and it just happened to fit well. But I regard it as a very small possibility. Certainly claiming that it is just a coincidence strains credulity.   I.A.1. Solar Flux Predictions  Pro is mistaken: The solar irradiation we are receiving has been declining for significantly longer. In fact, it has been decreasing since the 1980s, and would have been decreasing from the 1960s if not for a much larger drop that lasted a very short period of time. I.A.2. Cosmic Ray Flux  Cosmic rays induce aerosols, of that I have no doubt. But that does not necessarily lead to an increase in cloud cover, at least not a noticeable increase. There are various barriers to forming a cloud if one is a cosmic ray[2]. Mathematical models, meanwhile, put cosmic ray flux at two orders of magnitude too small to cause the observed cloud cover variation[3].  I.A.3. Ocean Currents  Ocean currents can't heat themselves, though. They can only shift heat around. The ocean itself is heating I.B. The 1500-Year Cycle  The 1500 year cycle my opponent refers to is, rather than an example of the globe increasing in temperature, an example of a bipolar see-saw, with the amount of heat remaining relatively constant but flowing to different places. My video explains this in more detail; increases in the North are offset by decreases in the South[5]. In climatology, these are called Dansgaard-Oeschger events[6].  Redistribution of heat is radically different than an increase in heat. The term 'global warming' indicates that, rather than heat flowing, the entire planet is warming--this is based up by graphs of total heat content[4].   II. Positive Effects of the Current Interglacial and Warm Period  II.A. Health Effects  I would simply like to reiterate that extreme heat does not behave the same as extreme cold. The predicted increase in deaths due to heat wave is approximately four times larger than the decrease in deaths due to cold snap[7]. The reason is simple: Easier to make fire than an air-conditioner.  Similarly, there is an upper limit to heat adaptability: Beyond about 35 degrees humans will start to experience the effects of hyperthermia, since we won't be able to dissipate heat[8]. An increase in seven degrees would cause large areas to experience this heat stress. This is about as the most reasonable value for the predicted temperature increase[9].  II.B. Economic Benefits  Plants that have more carbon dioxide and are experiencing more growth because of it also need more water to sustain that growth[10]. They are also more vulnerable to pests[11], and plants such as wheat can become less nutritous[12]. </t>
<h>  In plain English, that means that the equation is the result of what we think we know about how climate works, and was derived basically by combining a bunch of factors and seeing how we think that'll affect the climate.</h>
