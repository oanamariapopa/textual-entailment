    <t>There is so much on this issue I donapos;t know what to explain first.  Fact 1: There has been no significant atmospheric warming since 1998. In addition to this, there has been a lack of an atmospheric hotspot (in the mid to upper troposphere) that was predicted to be caused by greenhouse gas caused warming. This in itself proves that greenhouse gasses are not causing the recent warming trend. No warming 1: http://blogs.news.com.au... No warming 2: http://4.bp.blogspot.com... Lack of hotspot 1: https://mises.org... Lack of hotspot 2: http://sciencespeak.com... (Specifically on pg 6 but I suggest you read more)  Fact 2: Co2 is an extraordinarily weak greenhouse gas. According to atomic absorption spectroscopy, it can only store and release 7% of the electromagnetic spectrum that passes through it.  Fact 3: Throughout Earths history, Co2 has been much higher in the past showing that recent levels of Co2 are harmless. http://www.paulmacrae.com...  Fact 4: Recently, ice core data shows that Co2 followed temperature, sometimes by hundreds of years, not the other way around. Lags warming 1: https://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com... Lags warming 2: http://joannenova.com.au... Lags warming 3: http://i29.tinypic.com...  Fact 5: Co2 has never caused amplification of warming in the past. It is simple logic. If Co2 amplified temperature after orbital changes raised the temperature first, when would the amplification stop? The answer is when there is no more Co2 in the oceans. This would cause the oceans to become abnormally basic and this has only happened once in the last 25 million years: Ocean pH 25 million years: https://www.manicore.com... (I know it shows acidification at the end but this does not contradict my argument because it is a different result of more Co2.)  Fact 6: Almost every single computer model made by the IPCC is wrong. This suggests something fundamentally wrong with the models used. In addition, the models are all wrong because they predict to much heat which suggests that the effect of Co2 is being overblown. Computer models wrong 1: https://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com... Computer models wrong 2: http://c3headlines.typepad.com... Computer models wrong 3: http://cdn.phys.org...  Fact 7: The Earth has been warming for 15000 (or 20000) years. Warming for 15000 (or 20000 it depends on the data) years: http://www.oarval.org...  Fact 8: In the last 8000 years, we have had 4 major global warm periods naturally. We had the medieval warm period, the roman warm period, the Minoan warm period and the Holocene maximum. All major warm periods: http://notrickszone.com... Medieval warm period was global 1: http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org... Medieval warm period was global 2: http://www.climatedepot.com...  Fact 9: All major planet bodies in our solar system are experiencing rapid climate change, indicating that the heating on Earth could be caused by something in the solar system, not the planet.  Mars: Ice caps are shrinking, two pictures showed possible warming (these could be unreliable due to dust storms), atmosphere is gaining clouds, ozone and water vapor (indicating warming).  Pluto: Mysterious dark spots are becoming larger, atmospheric pressure increased by 300% (indicating warming)  Saturn: Giving off x-rays, growing storm spots and other hot spots in its atmosphere (indicating warming)  Uranus: Polar shifts, 2 large storms spots that were not there 50 years ago (indicating warming)  Mercury: Gaining a magnetic field, polar ice caps growing (indicating cooling)  Jupiter: Plasma clouds merging together and growing new storm spots (indicating an 18 degree Celsius warming)  Venus: 2500% increase in green glow indicating more oxygen in its atmosphere  Neptune: Weird changes in light intensity.  Earth: Rapid warming  As you can see, every major planet in our solar system is experiencing rapid climate change. Scientists theorize that this is due to increased amounts of energy in the space around our solar system.  Fact 10: There is no scientific way to test whether Co2 causes global warming. Yes, Co2 is a greenhouse gas and traps warmth, I am not denying that. What we havenquot;t tested is whether this warmth has a great enough impact to trump all other factors that influence climate. For example, ocean currents, cosmic rays, sun irradiance, the sun spot cycle, Earthquot;s magnetic field, Earthquot;s orbit, Earthquot;s tilt, Volcanos, etcquot; all effect the climate. Why is Co2 more important than all of these factors? Letquot;s find out! Oh, wait, you canquot;t. This is where you reach a problem. How do you find out? You canquot;t, scientifically, create a real, controlled experiment to test whether Co2 has a bigger impact than any of these other factors. This means that the entire idea that Co2 causes climate change is based on computer models and it canquot;t actually be tested. This shows that the idea that Co2 causes warming is less science then it is religion because you are putting your faith in a computer model rather than observing and recording data. Keep in mind that simple correlations do not qualify as scientific data.  Fact 11: During the post economic boom, when Co2 soared, temperatures fell despite the increase in Co2. This has been blamed on increased sulfur emissions but NASA says, quot;the cooling effect of the pollution aerosols will be somewhat regionally dependent, near and downwind of industrial areasquot; which explains how sulfur would only cause cooling in or around the areas it was released. This means that sulfur could not be responsible for the cooling. Post war economic boom: http://www.ofcomswindlecomplaint.net... Co2 levels: https://www3.epa.gov... As you can see, Co2 levels rose dramatically during the post economic boom, past what they had ever been at before, yet temperatures fell.  In conclusion, I have provided 11 facts explaining how Co2 can not, or has never been, a main climate driver. All the historical and recent evidence is stacked against it. While my opponent gives links to a consensus and impacts of possible warming, I have focused on the argument at hand. Explaining why Co2 does not drive climate. While my opponent has made little to no argument, I have shown why the conclusions of the scientists in the consensus he listed were wrong. I thank my opponent for this debate, and may the best man/woman win!</t>

    <t>First my opponent says that I should have asked questions about the structure earlier in the debate but ignores the fact that, in the comment section, I did ask about the order of the debate and explain what I thought it meant. Therefore, I did alert my opponent to my confusion and my opponent either chose to ignore it or did not see it but either way I made my confusion known. Therefore, my opponent did break their own rules.  My opponent then says, quot;if you are so sure you are correct and there are so many climate change deniers, why donapos;t you publish your r2-3 arguments in a peer reviewed journal?quot; My response to this is that: 1. There are not many climate change skeptics. This is because people choose not to be skeptical because believing in man made global warming is how you get grants. 2. I donapos;t publish my findings in a peer reviewed journal because they would not get published. This is because the people who choose what to publish in the journals most likely believe in man made global warming and are therefore biased against me. Another reason a journal would not publish a skeptical article about man made global warming is that if they did, then they would be accused of being funded by fossil fuel companies and would be ridiculed. Other scientists have already tried to publish their findings and it is always rejected so why should I try? What people donapos;t realize is that by attacking anyone who has a skeptical view of man made climate change you are preventing research into that area and therefore creating a huge bias in the experiments done and articles published.  In conclusion, my opponent has not rebutted even one of my claims, instead they focus on the accusations of rule breaking. Due to this absence of rebuttals, my arguments stand and therefore, based on this debate, I have proven how climate change is not much of a threat, and that global warming is not caused by man. While my opponent may of used abstracts from peer reviewed articles (as they love pointing out) I have won the debate. I have given 11 points to why climate change is not due to Co2 and given countless examples of natural disaster frequency staying constant. All of the arguments I have made in this debate go uncontested and therefore prove that climate change is not man made and that the threat is exaggerated. Due to this, all voters are mandated to vote Con under more convincing arguments and conduct.  Thank you for reading this debate.</t>

    <t>My opponent throws around a bunch of irrelevant facts to try to disprove highly credible and peer reviewed articles. At this point, responding to my opponentapos;s arguments directly would only give the impression that they were worth responding to. I added a few more peer reviewed articles to back up my points. I use peer reviewed to prove that anthropic climate change is real and a threat. When two sides of the debate conflict on facts, the winner goes to the side who uses the more credible sources. My opponent uses blogs and other sources with notorious reputations. Then, my opponent proceeds to engage in conjecture that these red herrings somehow impact the resolution. At the very least voters, give me the more credible sources points. The below quote, although lengthy explains that man-made climate change isnapos;t something far in the future, its an event that has occurred already and is continuing to occur and claim human lives. I have overwhelmingly met my burden of proof. Thanks for the debate. quot;quot;Unusually high temperatures, as well as socioeconomic vulnerability, along with social attenuation of hazards, in a general context where the anthropogenic contribution to climate change is becoming more plausible, led to an excess of 14,947 deaths in France, between August 4 and 18, 2003. The greatest increase in mortality was due to causes directly attributable to heat: dehydration, hyperthermia, heat stroke. In addition to age and gender, combinatorial factors included preexisting disease, medication, urban residence, isolation, poverty, and, probably, air pollution. Although diversely impacted or reported, many parts of Europe suffered human and other losses, such as farming and forestry through drought and fires. Summer 2003 was the hottest in Europe since 1500, very likely due in part to anthropogenic climate change.quot;quot; [5]Sources4. http://dx.doi.org...5. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com...6. http://science.sciencemag.org...7. http://iopscience.iop.org...</t>

    <t>My opponent breaks their own rules by not rebutting my argument. Therefore it is an automatic win for the Con as my opponent can decide when they want to break the rules or not, leaving me at an unfair disadvantage. Instead of following their own rules and rebutting my claims, my opponent decides to strengthen their argument. This creates an automatic win condition for the Con.

Sea levels are not rising due to heat because the Argo Buoy System data shows that the ocean has not warmed since we started measuring (2003) This shows that the sea only seems to be rising because of tectonic plate movement and the supposed rise is only due to a natural cycle: https://logiclogiclogic.files.wordpress.com...  Antarctic ice extent has reached record levels in 2012, 2013 and 2014: http://www.worldclimatereport.com... This has been blamed on increased precipitation causing more snowfall but if this is true then how come the same thing isnapos;t happening in the Arctic? If this were true, then Arctic ice would be growing too.  It is true that heat wave frequency has increased but other natural disaster frequencies have stayed constant proving that the climate change threat is either nonexistent or being exaggerated.  In conclusion, while I agree that rapid climate change poses a threat, I believe that this threat is being exaggerated and that humanity does not have to worry about extreme heat or any other natural disaster for much longer because once the world enters a natural cooling period all of this will be forgotten.</t>

    <t>Hello, loyal comrades.  As a devout socialist (coughs and splutters- apparently the word communist is illegal nowadays) I can confirm that the idea of an environment is a plot to destroy the capitalist infidels of the west, the idea is to push their focus so far into ideas of global warming and the environment that they will not see the coming revolution. Before they know it, the means of production will have been seized and the bourgeoise crippled.  The master plan for the environmental decoy was first formed by loyal soviet Leonid Kzyladskystok, whoapos;s idea was taken by Comrade Stalin, and itapos;s creator purged. The mighty Stalin then locked the idea away in a secret KGB chamber for later use. It was discovered years later, after the apos;fallapos; of the mighty Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, by loyal communist Hai Chi Zendog, who took the proposition to Xingping of China, who put the idea into action.  In more depth, the plot is to pull the focus of weak, populist politicians such as Barack Obama to the issues of global warming, and how to prevent it, while secretly building up a force to crush the bourgeoise and initiate the revolution. Machines of war, such as tanks and planes, will be cut down due to their apos;environmental costapos; by the U.S. and other western infidels, while the loyal socialists in the east grow in strength for the revolution.  Movements such as that of the infidel Donald J Trump have threatened to destroy the plot, so the spy Bernie Sanders was placed to win the presidency and continue to disillusion Americans and other westerners with the Global warming lie, in order to weaken the Bourgeoise for the upcoming revolution.  So there you have it, capitalist pigs, from an insider. The idea of an environment is actually a socialist plot to initiate the revolution and destroy capitalism.  Your loyal Comrade, Harry</t>

    <t>I would say the idea of the environment started with Charles Darwin in 1859. quot;The theory of evolution by natural selection, first formulated in Darwinapos;s book quot;On the Origin of Speciesquot; in 1859, is the process by which organisms change over time as a result of changes in heritable physical or behavioral traits. Changes that allow an organism to better adapt to its environment will help it survive and have more offspring. quot; [1]quot;In 1848, Marx and fellow German thinker Friedrich Engels published “The Communist Manifesto,” which introduced their concept of socialism as a natural result of the conflicts inherent in the capitalist system.quot; [2]As you can see the idea of the environment came out after the idea of Karl Marx in 1848. So this idea isnapos;t completely impossible. If the idea of the environment came before Marx was born I could show this as impossible. Instead, I will show how unlikely this idea that the environment is a socialist plot. Now Karl Marx and Darwin had contact, again I canapos;t show impossible, but can show improbable. quot;Letter from Charles Darwin to Karl MarxOctober, 1873quot; [3]As you can see Marx and Darwin did not have contact until 1873 which was well after the idea of the environment was developed. Of course it is possible that Marx influenced Darwin to create the theory of evolution as a socialist plot to destroy capitalism, yet I find this absurdly improbable.

    <t>OutlineI. IntroII. CorrelationIII. Confounding factorsIV. Reverse causalityV. Likely a threatVI. Man made VII. ConclusionVIII. SourcesI. Intro Brief intro, I created this debate before, and expected an easy win. I was completely blind sided by my opponentapos;s arguments and it was too late in the debate to recover. Basically, I ended up with a tangled mess and decided the best move was to give up and make a fresh start. Feel free to make the same arguments if you debated me before. Burden of proof, I need to prove three objectives to win. Burden of proof should be 99% Pro and 1% con on all three objectivesII. CorrelationTo prove causation I first need to prove correlation, which is easy enough. Insert picture here. [0] It is well known that carbon is increasing in parts per million. Now at 404.48 ppm[1]http://static.skepticalscience.com...; /gt;III. Confounding factorsThe second problem is confounding factors. Mostly some solar event that affects the entire solar system. Since only a few planets and moons are warming it is safe to assume there are no confounding factors with enough impact to be relevant. [2][3]To restate, surely there are negligible confounding factors that are irrelevant.IV. Reverse causalityNow the only part that is left for the first part of the burden of proof is causality. Co2 and global temperature have a two way causality relationship. Meaning as the oceans heat, Co2 is released which in turns heats up the ocean more. For example, when exiting an ice age first the Earth tilts raising temperature. [4]The temperature increase causes the oceans to release Co2 which is a green house gas. The green house gas in turn increase the oceanapos;s temperatures. Therefore, it is safe to say that Co2 causes global climate change. Readers should now be at least 99% sure that Co2 causes global climate change and warming.V. Likely a threatNow, to prove that the climate change we are experiencing regardless of the cause is a threat, we need a correlation when temperatures suddenly changed. Using the Antarctica ice, we can look at Co2 and temperatures back millions of years. Whenever we see a sudden spike in temperature mass extinctions occur.Mass extinction are a threat to the human race. In fact mass extinctions are occurring right now. Therefore, I have proven then sudden temperature changes, including the one we are experiencing at this moment are correlated with mass extinctions which we are experiencing now. There is also many political problems and threats that come with global climate change. [5] Bill Nye thinks IS (Islamic State) is linked with climate change. Farmers are abandoing their lands due to water shortfalls and becoming terrorists. Therefore, the Paris attacks were caused in part by global climate change.[6] I have fufilled my burden of proof that there is a 99% chance that climate change is a threat.VI. Man madeNow the most difficult part, to prove the changes are man-made. Many climate change deniers will agree with the first two parts and strongly disagree with the third. I need to prove there is at least a 99% chance that man made climate change is real. First, man made Co2 is only a small portion of the Co2 generated. The problem is two fold, first humans are destroying Co2 sinks including forests. Via human made deforestation we are removing much of our Co2 buffer. Second, we are producing Co2 via burning of fossil fuels. Unlike naturally occurring Co2 this is not cycled. Another way of explaining is that non-human Co2 is balanced out by naturally occurring events. Despite being small, made-made Co2 is upsetting the balance of nature. Yet, the question remains, how do we know its not natural? Remember the oceans releasing Co2. Well if this was a natural event the increase in Co2 would come from the oceans. To disprove this is not a natural event we can simply look at the Co2 and acidity of the oceans. The oceans are gaining in Co2 not losing. Meaning this is not a natural event that raises temperature and the Co2 is released from the oceans. Instead, the oceans are absorbing more Co2 then losing. [7] I have met my burden of proof that there is at least a 99% chance that global climate change is man made. VII. ConclusionJust in case you needed more evidence here is some easily observable evidence including glaciers. [8] I have fulfilled my burden of proof, 99% that climate change is real and a threat. Man made global climate change is real and is a threat. Thanks for the debate. VIII.

    <t>The problem with your argument is humans have been wrong with a lot of ideas. I find most of your argument fits under the ad populum fallacy. [2] Just because the majority of scientists think man made climate change is real and a threat, does not mean the scientists are correct. At one time we thought the Earth was flat and the sun revolved around the Earth. quot; quot;Does the Earth go around the Sun, or does the Sun go around the Earth?quot;If you answered the latter, youapos;re among a quarter of Americans who also got it wrong, according to a new report by the National Science Foundation. quot; [3]There is a chance that the entire global warming/climate change is a scam. That the deniers are whistle blowers. If we start jailing whistle blowers we could be in a lot of trouble. [4] Remember that 97% of climate change scientists agree. That means 3% donapos;t, those 3% could be legitimate whistle blowers. Some of the scientist claim there is bullying going on to reach the consensuses. [5] There is talk of data manipulation. [6] Honestly, I will not stoop by backing up the deniers. I think the chances of the deniers being wrong is at least 99%. Nevertheless, there is that 1% chance.

    <t>My opponent accepts that his first argument is a correlation so there is no need to strengthen my argument there.  My opponents second argument states, quot;quot;quot;When the Earth comes out of an ice age, the warming is not initiated by CO2 but by changes in the Earthapos;s orbit. The warming causes the oceans to release CO2. The CO2 amplifies the warming and mixes through the atmosphere, spreading warming throughout the planet. So CO2 causes warming AND rising temperature causes CO2 rise. Overall, about 90% of the global warming occurs after the CO2 increase.quot;quot;quot;  To disprove this I will do it line by line.  Line 1: When the Earth comes out of an ice age, the warming is not initiated by CO2 but by changes in the Earthapos;s orbit This line is true but only in some cases. For example, the mini ice age, which we exited 1000 years ago, was not initiated by changes in the earths orbit.  Line 2: This line is just wrong. The oceans do store Co2 but what is released when they warm is mostly water vapor, not Co2. This water vapor then causes more clouds which then cools the Earth. This is common knowledge among scientists because this is exactly how cosmic rays cause cooling.  Line 3: Yes, rising temperature causes more Co2 to be released but by simply looking at ice core data we can see that this does not cause an infinite rise in temperature. The temperature then drops and rises again independent of the Co2 that was released from the previous rise. For an example, look at this graph: http://www.geocraft.com...  My opponents next argument is just plain wrong. My opponent states, quot;quot;Even if we ignore long term trends and just look at the record-breakers, 2015, 2014, 2010, and 2005 were hotter than 1998.  The myth of no warming since 1998 was based on the satellite record estimates of the temperature of the atmosphere. However, as discussed in the video below by Peter Sinclair, even that argument is no longer accurate. The satellites show warming since 1998 too.quot; quot;  To disprove this all you need to do is read the caption at the top of the graph below where it lists its source. http://4.bp.blogspot.com... As you can see, the graph was not based on temperature estimates but the quot;global mean temperature change...quot; I donapos;t know where you got the idea that 2015, 2014, 2010, and 2005 were hotter than 1998 but from your sources it seems that this data is only true once you remove the El Nino. My question to you is why hasnapos;t the Earth warmed since the El Nino. In the 20 years since the temperature maximum temperature doesnapos;t increase at all. In addition to this, the El Nino just proves the fact that there are other influences in climate that influence temperature more then Co2 or enough to distort data.  For my opponents next argument he states that my source is not credible. This is just not true. Just because the maker of the website is paid to research evidence against man made global warming does not immediately make all of his evidence untrue. My opponent does not provide any actual contrary evidence to debate this point but to satisfy their needs I will give a link to multiple graphs sourced from other websites showing the same thing. http://c3headlines.typepad.com... http://www.drroyspencer.com... http://i.dailymail.co.uk... http://www.cafeconlecherepublicans.com...  My opponents next argument is not relevant to man made climate change.  My opponents next argument states, quot;Not every prediction in the Inconvenient Truth came true. Nevertheless polar bears are struggling and many ice caps are melting. [5]  As for the polar bears this is due to hunting restrictions and bans. quot;  I will cede this point to my opponent as it is a result of warming and not relevant to man causing the warming. I should not have brought it up and while I still have arguments to dispute it do not wish to argue this view any longer.  As for why the documentary was manipulated, I do not wish to argue this any more either for the same reasons listed above nevertheless I will provide a short article to explain my first argument. I know that the article does not provide much info on the subject but if you really want to understand the argument then you need to research it yourself. http://www.newsmax.com...  Nextl, to strengthen my point of the debate, I will argue that Earth is not the only planet warming. The entire solar system seems to be going through a sort of quot;climate-change phase.quot; Within the last 20 years scientists at NASA and around the world have realized that the planets we are looking at now are different than those in 1900s. This indicates that the entire solar system is in some sort of solar-system wide climate change.  For example, the ice caps on Mars are shrinking (indicating warming) and the atmosphere is gaining clouds and ozone, Pluto is experiencing a growth of its mysterious dark spots and is experiencing a 300% increase in atmospheric pressure (indicating warming), Saturn is giving off large amount of x rays and there are new appearances of quot;hot spotsquot; in its atmosphere (indicating warming), there have been polar shifts on Uranus and voyager 2 picked up large storm spots In its atmosphere that were not there 50 years ago (indicating warming), Mercury is growing a magnetic field, Jupiterquot;s quot;white ovalsquot; are disappearing and melding together in its atmosphere (this is theorized to have been caused by an 18 degree Celsius warming and this is supported by the new large storm spots appearing on Jupiter for the first time), Venus has had a 2500% increase in green glow which symbolizes oxygen in the atmosphere, and Neptune is experiencing changes in light intensity.  As you can see from the long paragraph I have provided above, the entire Solar System seems to be warming or experiencing some sort of weird climate change patterns. This indicates more then just a global event.  To conclude my argument, I will provide a graph of Co2 and Temperature over the long term that should, on its own, disprove entirely the idea of man-made climate change. http://www.paulmacrae.com...</t>

    <t>First, I would like to thank my opponent for debating this topic with me in a respectful manner. Courage is needed to go against the majority. Second, I would like to note my opponentapos;s response is very dense. To disprove my opponentapos;s arguments I need to take my opponentapos;s statements a few sentences at a time. quot;Your first argument, quot;Carbon dioxide is at 404.48 parts per million and the temperature has increased 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880.quot; That is not a scientific argument. It is a correlation. There is no REAL evidence to suggest that Co2 impact temperature.quot; rammer5678Yes, you are correct as presented it is a correlation.

Temperatures have risen.

However, as discussed in the video below by Peter Sinclair, even that argument is no longer accurate.

As for your link from wattsupwiththat.com, this is a known climate change denial site. The site is run by Willard Anthony Watts.

Cigarette companies show the depths that people will sink to. quot;Al Gores, quot;The Inconvenient Truthquot; predicted that all the arctic ice caps would be melted by 2013.

[5]As for the polar bears this is due to hunting restrictions and bans. quot; The introduction of the International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears in 1973, which restricted or even banned hunting in some circumstances, consequently resulted in an increase in polar bear numbers.quot; [6]As you can see, Iapos;ve destroyed all your arguments while proving causation of CO2 to increase temperature. A few notes, the polar bears are still in danger in the long term. [7] The ice caps melting has provided less hunting ground for them.You also make some inflammatory remarks like Al Goreapos;s documentary was riddled with lies. Many of the predictions have come true. Also, there is a large difference between a falsehood and a lie. The models could not take in every single factor. As time prorgresses we get more and more accurate models. You have provided no evidence that the documentary was manpiulated. A person with the best of intentions can come to the wrong conclusion.

    <t>There is so much information on the topic that rather than reiterate all of it I will make a short summary. Also burden of proof will be 51% on my opponent and 49% on me. Manmade global climate change is the general increase in temperature at rapid rates that is mainly caused by CO2 from industry increases. Carbon dioxide is at 404.48 parts per million and the temperature has increased 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880. [0]Although 1.4 degrees doesnapos;t sound much, it ends up being a lot. This is because not all areas of the world heat at the same rate and such a rapid change is hard to adapt to. There is no signs of relief from climate change. My opponent will attempt to deny climate change, but please remember how long the cigarette companies held out despite the science being heavily against them. Now we know as sure as the sun rises that cigarettes cause cancer. I can honestly state that as sure as the sun rises, global climate change is upon us and is a threat. Al Goreapos;s inconvenient truth is still a master piece, and I will not accept defeat until my opponent can defeat the documentary. [1]Not watching Al Goreapos;s documentary is no excuse.

    <t>My opponent does not counter-argue even one of the points I made in my previous arguments/in the comment section. Instead he accuses of of making the argument grow in size to confuse people. Not only is this not true, but it points out how little my opponent understands my argument and this subject. If he had simply read the counter arguments I provided, you can see clearly that I do not try to distract from the topic at hand.  Seeing as my opponent made no further arguments and did not make any comments about how I disproved all of his (relating to man causing the warming) claims, I am only left with the option to strengthen my own argument.  Fact 1: Co2 is a weak greenhouse gas. According to atomic absorption spectroscopy, a method in science used to measure the amount of the electromagnetic spectrum a molecule can store/release, Co2 can only store 7% of the heat that passes through it in the 15 micrometer range. This is minuscule, especially when compared to water vapor which can store 850% more heat then Co2 can.  Fact 2: There is not much Co2 in the atmosphere compared to the rest of the earths history and history tells us there is little to no correlation of temperature to Co2 over long periods of time. It is as simple as looking at this graph: http://www.paulmacrae.com...  Fact 3: Almost every single planet in the solar system is exhibiting some sort of characteristic attributed to warming. If every planet is warming simultaneously, then why is Earth warming not natural. (For more info check the comment section where there was a mini debate on the subject or my previous debate where I explained the attributes each planet it expressing)  Fact 3: There has been no significant warming in the last 20 years. We have already discussed this topic and my opponent brought up a good argument against it but I disproved it in my last argument (and the comment section). (Keep in mind that in the last 20 years 25% of all Co2 released by man has been released during that period)  Fact 4: The Earth has been warming for the last 20,000 years and the recent uptick started in the 1700apos;s, before the industrial revolution. https://conscioustourism.files.wordpress.com...  Fact 5: Sun spots and ocean currents correlated stronger with temperature then Co2 for the majority of the 1900s. Yes, sun spot numbers decreased towards the end of the 1900s but that is also right before temperatures flat lined. Sun Spots Graph: (According to Joe Bastardi the correlation (not on this exact graph) )is .57 1900-2004) http://www.soest.hawaii.edu... Ocean Current Graph: (According to Joe Bastardi the correlation here is .85 1900s-2007) http://i0.wp.com... Co2 Graph: (According to Joe Bastardi the correlation (not on this exact graph) is .47 1895-2007) http://zfacts.com...  Fact 6: Cosmic rays prove that greenhouse gasses do not have a big impact on the atmosphere. Cosmic rays effect temperature by increasing evaporation, and, in turn, causing more cloud cover which reflects the suns heat off the earth. This disproves man-made climate change because the water vapor doesnquot;t cause the earth to warm more than the clouds it forms causes the Earth to cool. This just proves the fact that other variables in the climate have way more of an effect on the overall temperature then most greenhouse gasses and the idea that Co2, which is weaker then water vapor, solely dictates climate is just plain wrong.  Fact 7: Almost every single climate model prediction warming from Co2 was wrong (see earlier argument for graphs)  Fact 8: There is no way to scientifically test, through a controlled experiment, whether Co2 causes enough warming to drive the atmosphere. You can test that the Co2 is a greenhouse gas, but you canapos;t test that it is a strong enough greenhouse gas to impact global climate. This just proves that the idea that Co2 causes warming is not based in science. It is based off of faith in computer models or flawed logic.  In conclusion, I have now proven, beyond any doubt, that Co2 cannot be the main climate driver. I have given historical evidence, explained the flaws in the logic presented through cosmic ray induced cooling, shown how Co2 driving climate canapos;t be scientifically tested, explained how we are not the only planet experiencing warming and described how much stronger other climate drivers are then Co2 by presenting correlation strengths of each driver. My opponent has effectively given up the argument and accused me of distracting the readers from the problem at hand. As you can see, just by reading the 8 facts listed above, I have not distracted, I have not manipulated. I have provided clear, easy to understand, proof to why my opponent is wrong. I have disproven all of his arguments, whether in the comment section or in my arguments presented above and given countless examples of evidence to why my side of the argument is correct. Thank you for reading this long debate and I hope you are certain of the right choice when you vote.  To my opponent: I will be very surprised if you are reading this because it seems you have been ignoring my arguments from the beginning. You are so biased towards your own opinion that I am surprised you even decided to read any of my arguments instead of saying, quot;oh, he didnapos;t separate the lines into enough paragraphs!quot; and ignoring them. I have looked at your past debates and concluded that, while you have done a good job at defeating some people, Retroz and maybe Epidexipteryx have both gotten the better of you. Even in your past debates (including the ones you have won) you have not been able to prove anything you claim. You attack sources, you focus on grammar, but you donapos;t focus on your argument. This is why you attacked the whatsupwiththat website without providing any actual evidence showing the data I presented from it was wrong. In fact, you even admitted it was right! This just proves that attacking sources doesnapos;t get you anywhere with your argument. Just a side tip, if you are going to attack anyone elseapos;s sources in future arguments, skeptical science isnapos;t a trustworthy website either.

Here is an article saying the same thing: http://www.forbes.com... Keep in mind that this renders almost every single one of your arguments useless so if this debate actually focused on how credible sources are, I would instantly win.

    <t>I am here to debate the MAN MADE side of climate change. I do not disagree that the world is warming, I only believe the current warming trends are exaggerated and people are freaking out over a natural process.  Man Made Climate Change, The FACTS:  1.There is NO way to test whether Co2 is the most contributing factor to the worldquot;s climate: Many people I have met say, quot;Manmade global warming is real and Co2 is the cause!quot; but how do you actually test that. Yes, Co2 is a greenhouse gas and traps warmth, I am not denying that. What we havenquot;t tested is whether this warmth has a great enough impact to trump all other factors that influence climate. For example, ocean currents, cosmic rays, sun irradiance, the sun spot cycle, Earthquot;s magnetic field, Earthquot;s orbit, Earthquot;s tilt, Volcanos, etcquot; all effect the climate. Why is Co2 more important than all of these factors? Letquot;s find out! Oh, wait, you canquot;t. This is where you reach a problem. How do you find out? You canquot;t, scientifically, create a real, controlled experiment to test whether Co2 has a bigger impact than any of these other factors. This means that the entire idea that Co2 causes climate change is based on computer models and it canquot;t actually be tested. This shows that the idea that Co2 causes warming is less science then it is religion because you are putting your faith in a computer model rather than observing and recording data. Keep in mind that simple correlations do not qualify as scientific data. Proof that greenhouse gasses donquot;t have a large impact on climate can be found at the bottom of this page at quot;Final Proof.quot; 2.The computer models donquot;t work The computer models mentioned previously have been shown not to work time and time again. Even the most advanced ones fail and donquot;t predict the correct temperature. This is because people think that Co2 has more of an impact then it really does so when they program it into the models it messes with the correct predictions. This is why the vast majority of climate models predict temperature is way higher than it is. https://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com...  3.Co2 is a weak greenhouse gas According to atomic absorption spectroscopy, a method used to measure the amount of the electromagnetic spectrum a molecule can absorb, Co2 can only store a miniscule 7% of the amount of heat that passes through it in the 15 micrometer range. Compare this to water vapor, which, in statistics, can store 850% more heat than Co2 can. In addition to this, there is 2100000% more water vapor in the air then Co2. This shows that Co2 is actually a relatively weak greenhouse gas and for it to make an impact you would need much more of it then there is now.  4.There is not as much Co2 as you might think I have constantly heard, over and over again, that there is too much Co2 in the atmosphere. The problem with this statement is that it is just plain wrong. Comparing the amount of Co2 we have in the atmosphere now (400 parts per million, ppm for short) and we have had in the last 650 million years shows that now we are in a Co2 starved era. For example, look at this graph: http://www.paulmacrae.com... Keep in mind that this graph only goes back 650 million years. Co2 has been over 10000ppm in the past and temperature had been relatively low at that time.  5.The earth has been warming for 20,000 years now: Not only is the idea that Co2 is causing the recent warming preposterous, but it just doesnquot;t make any sense. This is because the world has been warming naturally for the last 20,000 years and the recent uptick in warming started in the 1700s. Both of these time periods were before any humans were releasing any significant amount of Co2. This only proves that the current warm phase is natural. https://conscioustourism.files.wordpress.com... More evidence would be that there hasnquot;t been any significant warming in the last 20 years. Yes, this is a small amount of time, but if temperature truly relied on Co2 as its main cause then surely the temperature should have gone up. Especially considering that 25% of all Co2 released by man ever has been released into the atmosphere in the last few decades.  The political side of things: This is a big topic so I wonquot;t be able to cover everything but I will do the most important topics under this subject. The 97% number: This number is thrown around way too often and most of the time misused. This number came from a study that stated as its conclusion, quot;97% of climate scientists agree that climate change is realquot; but everyone seems to think it said man-made climate change was real. Another problem with this number is that it came from a survey that completely manipulated almost every scientific paper that was submitted. All the papers in the survey were ultimately sent to one man (John Cook) who categorized based on what he thought they meant. Not only is this a biased way of filtering through papers but what the papers said depended on his opinion, not on their actual statements. This anti-science method of categorizing papers eventually led thousands of scientific papers to be misrepresented in the survey. Watch this video to hear what I said but in a more in-depth way: https://www.youtube.com...  The 2 degree rise: This claim is also completely bogus. The idea that a 2 degree rise in average temperature is going to devastate the world is just plain wrong. The world was 2 degrees warmer during the medieval warming period 1000 years. Then, before the medieval warming period was the Roman warming period which was warmer then the medieval. Then, even before the Roman, there was the Minoan warming period which was 4 degrees Celsius warmer then today.  The hockey stick: The graph was fabricated and is completely fake and manipulated. Iquot;m too lazy to explain it all so click on the presentation someone else made below to find out why Iquot;m right: http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org...  The final proof: And now, I present to you, the final proof of why man-made climate change isnquot;t real: It is known that cosmic rays effect temperature by increasing evaporation, and, in turn, causing more cloud cover which reflects the suns heat off the earth. This disproves man-made climate change because the water vapor, which is 850% more potent then Co2, doesnquot;t cause the earth to warm more than the clouds it forms causes the Earth to cool. This just proves the fact that other factors in the climate have way more of an effect on the overall temperature then most greenhouse gasses and the idea that Co2, which is weaker then water vapor, solely dictates climate is just plain wrong.</t>

    <t>If you wanted a serious debate then you would not have ignored my entire argument. So I guess since you are not paying attention to my arguments I will just have to disprove yours instead of adding to my own.  You firstly say that, quot;The temperature has increased .87 Celsius.quot; This is true, but you forgot to mention that the warming period that caused this rise started in the 1700apos;s before the industrial revolution. In addition to this, the world has been naturally warming for the last 20,000 years. You ignored large amounts of scientific data in your argument and made a claim that I agree with. The world IS WARMING!!! It just is not caused by man.  https://conscioustourism.files.wordpress.com...  According to your second argument, Co2 is at 400 ppm. This is true, but there has been no substantial warming for the last 20 years which is proof of how temperature and Co2 act independently. In addition to this, 25% of all Co2 released by man has been released during the last 20 year period. This in itself disproves your claim.  http://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com...  In addition to this, Co2 has been at much higher levels in the past. To restate what I said above, quot;Comparing the amount of Co2 we have in the atmosphere now (400 parts per million, ppm for short) and we have had in the last 650 million years shows that now we are in a Co2 starved era. For example, look at this graph: http://www.paulmacrae.com...... Keep in mind that this graph only goes back 650 million years. Co2 has been over 10000 ppm in the past and temperature had been relatively low at that time.quot;  There may be a clear and strong positive correlation between Co2 and temperature but this correlation has been weak compared to that of sun spots. For the majority of the 1900apos;s sun spots correlated MORE STRONGLY to temperature then Co2 did. This means that sun spots had a bigger impact then Co2 on the temperature. Yes, I know that sun spot numbers dropped around the early 2000s but that is irrelevant because for the majority of the 1900apos;s, when tons and tons of Co2 were released, the temperature was affected more by sun spots then it was by Co2. Another thing to point out, when sun spot numbers started to drop is when the flat line in temperature began.  http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu...  http://geoffair.net...  In actual statistics, according to Joe Bastardi, Co2 has a correlation strength to temperature of just .43 (1895-2007). Other sources say that the correlation strength is just .07 or .02 (1998-2007).

    <t>Thank you for being honest and admitting you donapos;t understand my arguments. Many people would not do that and it is a very honorable thing to do. I strongly encourage you to do your own research into both sides of the argument. That is what I did and ultimately found that the con side has a better argument.  Two things that could help you get started in your research into the con side are these YouTube videos: 1. The Great Global Warming Swindle Full Movie ( I know this is long but if you have the time then watch at least some of it)  2. Climate Change in 12 minutes - the skeptics case  These two sources are really great and show a lot of flaws in your side of the argument  Sadly, I only saw them yesterday so I couldnapos;t use their points in this debate :)  Thank you for debating and I hope you look into both sides because there are legitimate reasons why people donapos;t believe in man made global warming.</t>

    <t>Please stick to only the man-made part of this argument. I am not denying the world is heating or any possible effects of that. I am saying that man does not cause it.  Also, quoting a consensus is NOT science. I want to hear your argument, not some random scientists. Science is based off of hard facts and evidence to support claims, not a consensus of random scientists whether they studied climate or not.  Here are my reasons: 1.There is NO way to test whether Co2 is the most contributing factor to the worldquot;s climate: Many people I have met say, quot;Man made global warming is real and Co2 is the cause!quot; but how do you actually test that. Yes, Co2 is a greenhouse gas and traps warmth, I am not denying that. What we havenquot;t tested is whether this warmth has a great enough impact to trump all other factors that influence climate. For example, ocean currents, cosmic rays, sun irradiance, the sun spot cycle, Earthquot;s magnetic field, Earthquot;s orbit, Earthquot;s tilt, Volcanos, etcquot; all effect the climate. Why is Co2 more important than all of these factors? Letquot;s find out! Oh, wait, you canquot;t. This is where you reach a problem. How do you find out? You canquot;t, scientifically, create a real, controlled experiment to test whether Co2 has a bigger impact than any of these other factors. This means that the entire idea that Co2 causes climate change is based on computer models and it canquot;t actually be tested. This shows that the idea that Co2 causes warming is less science then it is religion because you are putting your faith in a computer model rather than observing and recording data. Keep in mind that simple correlations do not qualify as scientific data. Proof that greenhouse gasses donquot;t have a large impact on climate can be found at the bottom of this page at quot;Final Proof.quot;  2.The computer models donquot;t work The computer models mentioned previously have been shown not to work time and time again. Even the most advanced ones fail and donquot;t predict the correct temperature. This is because people think that Co2 has more of an impact then it really does so when they program it into the models it messes with the correct predictions. This is why the vast majority of climate models predict temperature is way higher than it is. https://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com......  3.Co2 is a weak greenhouse gas According to atomic absorption spectroscopy, a method used to measure the amount of the electromagnetic spectrum a molecule can absorb, Co2 can only store a miniscule 7% of the amount of heat that passes through it in the 15 micrometer range. Compare this to water vapor, which, in statistics, can store 850% more heat than Co2 can. In addition to this, there is 2100000% more water vapor in the air then Co2. This shows that Co2 is actually a relatively weak greenhouse gas and for it to make an impact you would need much more of it then there is now.  4.There is not as much Co2 as you might think I have constantly heard, over and over again, that there is too much Co2 in the atmosphere. The problem with this statement is that it is just plain wrong. Comparing the amount of Co2 we have in the atmosphere now (400 parts per million, ppm for short) and we have had in the last 650 million years shows that now we are in a Co2 starved era. For example, look at this graph: http://www.paulmacrae.com...... Keep in mind that this graph only goes back 650 million years. Co2 has been over 10000ppm in the past and temperature had been relatively low at that time.  5.The earth has been warming for 20,000 years now: Not only is the idea that Co2 is causing the recent warming preposterous, but it just doesnquot;t make any sense. This is because the world has been warming naturally for the last 20,000 years and the recent uptick in warming started in the 1700s. Both of these time periods were before any humans were releasing any significant amount of Co2. This only proves that the current warm phase is natural. https://conscioustourism.files.wordpress.com...... More evidence would be that there hasnquot;t been any significant warming in the last 20 years. Yes, this is a small amount of time, but if temperature truly relied on Co2 as its main cause then surely the temperature should have gone up. Especially considering that 25% of all Co2 released by man ever has been released into the atmosphere in the last few decades.  The political side of things: This is a big topic so I wonquot;t be able to cover everything but I will do the most important topics under this subject. The 97% number: This number is thrown around way too often and most of the time misused. This number came from a study that stated as its conclusion, quot;97% of climate scientists agree that climate change is realquot; but everyone seems to think it said man-made climate change was real. Another problem with this number is that it came from a survey that completely manipulated almost every scientific paper that was submitted. All the papers in the survey were ultimately sent to one man (John Cook) who categorized based on what he thought they meant. Not only is this a biased way of filtering through papers but what the papers said depended on his opinion, not on their actual statements. This anti-science method of categorizing papers eventually led thousands of scientific papers to be misrepresented in the survey. Watch this video to hear what I said but in a more in-depth way: https://www.youtube.com......  The 2 degree rise: This claim is also completely bogus. The idea that a 2 degree rise in average temperature is going to devastate the world is just plain wrong. The world was 2 degrees warmer during the medieval warming period 1000 years. Then, before the medieval warming period was the Roman warming period which was warmer then the medieval. Then, even before the Roman, there was the Minoan warming period which was 4 degrees Celsius warmer then today.  The hockey stick: The graph was fabricated and is completely fake and manipulated. Iquot;m too lazy to explain it all so click on the presentation someone else made below to find out why Iquot;m right: http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org......  The final proof: And now, I present to you, the final proof of why man-made climate change isnquot;t real: It is known that cosmic rays effect temperature by increasing evaporation, and, in turn, causing more cloud cover which reflects the suns heat off the earth. This disproves man-made climate change because the water vapor, which is 850% more potent then Co2, doesnquot;t cause the earth to warm more than the clouds it forms causes the Earth to cool. This just proves the fact that other factors in the climate have way more of an effect on the overall temperature then most greenhouse gasses and the idea that Co2, which is weaker then water vapor, solely dictates climate is just plain wrong.</t>

    <t>*Sorry for assuming your gender but I didnapos;t realize that I wrote quot;hequot; instead of quot;theyquot; until the very end! :)  Im going to start my argument by countering my opponents observations. His first observation states that he will debate that humans are contributing to the already natural processes but my question is contributing how much. There is not doubt in my mind that Co2 causes warming. The question is whether this warming is significant or not. To clarify, I believe the warming Co2 creates is insignificant and barely has an effect on climate.  His second observation states that quoting a scientific consensus is science. He is correct in saying that a consensus is more scientific then a home experiment but a scientific paper or research article is better then both. Especially when there is so much controversy about the validity of the consensus.  My opponent then addresses my first argument and states, quot;I will provide empirical evidence that in fact it has a huge impact if not the biggestquot; yet he provides no evidence after this claim.  I run into the same problem when he addresses my second claim. He says, quot; there is other evidence that proves CO2 does have an impactquot; while providing NO scientific evidence. (keep in mind that correlations do NOT show causation so giving a graph of temperature and Co2 rising is not sufficient evidence) He also says that computer models are not always going to be 100% correct which is true but you would expect the predictions made by said models to be closer to the observations. The fact that only a small majority of the models show similar trends to our observations indicate that something is wrong with the models.  In my opponents addressing of my third statement, he makes a valid case, pointing out the fact that Co2 increases atmospheric humidity but disregards the fact that water vapor then condenses into clouds which then reflect heat and light energy away from the earth, therefore cooling it down. I mentioned this at the end of my argument under the label, quot;The Final proofquot; where I explained how cosmic rays cause cooling and why this disproves the greenhouse effect.  My opponent then says, quot;my opponent is stating we would need more CO2 to see an impact.quot; Although I did not state this before, I do agree with this statement. My opponent says this is a unscientific claim but ignores that planets, such as Venus, with extraordinary high (96%) levels of Co2 in their atmosphere are warmer because of it. Nasa says that venus would not be as hot as it is without Co2 or methane.  My opponent also says there is an undoubted correlation between Co2 and warming but this statement depends on what time period you are looking at. For example, according to Joe Bastardi, Co2 has a correlation strength to temperature of just .43 (1895-2007). Other sources say that the correlation strength is just .07 or .02 (1998-2007). according to Joe Bastardi, Co2 has a correlation strength to temperature of just .43 (1895-2007). Compare this correlation strength to the correlation strength of sunspots and the ocean, .57 (1900-2004) and .85 (1900-2007). As you can see, the correlation strength of Co2 compared to other correlations is anything but strong. Another thing to point out is that over longer periods of time, Co2 has almost no correlation to temperature. I meant to put this graph in my argument above but I posted the wrong link so here is the evidence supporting my claim: http://www.paulmacrae.com...  Then my opponent states the Co2 has not been higher then today within the last 800,000 years. This is true, but there is a problem this points out. The temperature HAS been higher then today. This just proves that temperature acts independent of Co2. Co2 has not been higher then today while temperature has risen up to 4 degrees Celsius hotter then today. http://jonova.s3.amazonaws.com...  Then, in my opponents fifth point, he states, quot;Today though, we are seeing this clearly attributed to CO2 in the air from humans as the temperature goes beyond what would be seen as natural.quot; This is just an untrue statement. The majority of the worlds lifespan has been spent with no ice on the poles and the dinosaurs lived in an environment that was much hotter then today. Also, as I mentioned earlier, in the past 1000 years, during the medieval warming period, temperature was 2 degrees Celsius warmer then today and that was only in the last 1000 years!  Thanks for acknowledging that the political arguments are irrelevant, I have argued with many people about this topic before and the political arguments always come up so I wanted to include some just to ward people off if that is what they were planning to debate.  In my opponents case he just states everything that I have already disproven.  He says greenhouse gasses cause warming but Co2 is a very weak greenhouse gas and there is not much of it in the atmosphere.  He says humans are netting 15 gigatons of Co2 into the atmosphere which is true but he doesnapos;t explain why, if there is so much Co2 in the air, there has been no significant warming in the last 2 decades. Especially when 25% of all human caused Co2 emissions occurred during that time period. Another problem is that the chart he provided of the carbon cycle is wrong. I have seen charts like it before and the problem with them is that they donapos;t explain rises in Co2, sometimes over periods of millions of years, in the past. According to that chart, Co2 would be on a constant decline. We know this is not true because looking at a graph he provided us (http://assets.climatecentral.org...) Co2 is constantly in balance with the environment. It is not on an overall decrease.  To my opponents final message, I donapos;t know why the atmosphere is warming if it is not caused by Co2. I am not even going to try and come up with other reasons because the climate is constantly changing and to complex for me to completely understand. I have seen the video you sent me, along with all the other videos in that college course. The problem with the video is that it relies on the idea that Co2 causes warming. Without any significant warming affects, how do they know the quot;fingerprintquot; it leaves? This just causes a loop back to the debate about whether it actually causes warming or not.  After reading your responses and acknowledging the claims you have made, I see no real scientific evidence of man-made global warming. Yes, there are correlations and yes, there are consensuses, but none of these are true pieces of evidence. True evidence would be performing a controlled experiment and testing only 1 variable at a time. As I explained in my first argument, this is not possible.  In conclusion, I await your next argument and wish you the best of luck in debating me.</t>

    <t>My opponent kept mentioning that I was making claims without backing them. I was unclear but thatapos;s because my case was at the bottom and had gone over that evidence. To eliminate as much confusion as possible I will add all that evidence with those statements that appeared to have none.  My evidence that CO2 has a huge impact is here:  1: My opponent has acknowledged that CO2 is a green house gas. Green house gasses cause global warming.  2: humans are netting 15 gigatons of carbon into the atmosphere that has no place in the carbon cycle. Prior to industry all carbon fit into the cycle. https://www.newscientist.com......  3: If CO2 causes warming, and humans are omitting extra CO2 that we are having an impact on climate. Thus I hold my claim that humans are impacting climate change.  Of course my opponent clarified that the real debate is how much CO2 has an impact and whether it is miniscule. So they would say some measure that CO2 is a major player in changing the climate. That evidence is in trends in the atmosphere where lower layers are heating up and upper layers are not. This is a sign of CO2 causing the heating.  On top of that, use my opponents point that if venus didnapos;t have as much CO2 they would be significantly cooler. This proves that there is significant correlation between CO2 and climate. Then throw in how much CO2 humans throw into the atmosphere and what trends we are seeing now and conclude for yourself.  This all rest the case that climate change is being effected by men. My opponent is probably going to argue that they need to see cold hard numbers, but this is not grounds to throw out the logic I have provided. Its impossible to measure with certainty exactly how much people are impacting. But the logic is there and evidence does point to CO2 being the main cause.  Also, just in case my opponent isnapos;t sure that CO2 is coming from people, I ask he or she look to this evidence again that shows the carbon cycle was working naturally until industrial CO2 overloaded it. https://www.newscientist.com...  My opponent is always saying that the correlation is not strong. For this just keep in mind the physical signs we are seeing that it is CO2 such as the atmospheric patterns of heating showing that CO2 is the cause of this, not other signs. It doesnapos;t get much more scientific.  My opponent writes quot;Then my opponent states the Co2 has not been higher then today within the last 800,000 years. This is true, but there is a problem this points out. The temperature HAS been higher then today. This just proves that temperature acts independent of Co2. Co2 has not been higher then today while temperature has risen up to 4 degrees Celsius hotter then today.quot; http://jonova.s3.amazonaws.com......  Of course the graph they is of one place which is a spotlight fallacy. You canapos;t point to one location. Also the largest difference in temperatures is in 7 degrees Fahrenheit over the past 10,000 years.  When my opponent quotes me saying the temperature todays is unnatural, they misunderstood my point.  I wasnapos;t saying that extreme temperatures havenapos;t occurred naturally. I meant that we would expect the dramatic changes to be much further apart. In the years before the recent era major changes in climate were rare and on somewhat of a cycle of hot to cold and back with even spacing of time. now we are seeing changes much more erratically and quickly.  My opponent is arguing that man made climate change has not been proven with fool proof certainty and has turned this into an evidence debate. So far this debate has been a debate of clashing evidence that cancel out each-others claims. There has been a lot of research on each side that can just as reliably disprove the other. At this point it is time to look to logical claims and each side ought to put up some logic to the claim.  I have given a clear thought process as to why men and women have had an impact on the climate. I would like to see logical sequential ideas that lead to the notion that climate change must be all natural.  Thanks for this debate to this point so far. (:</t>

    <t>First I would like to thank my opponent for the opportunity for this debate,  I would like to start by making a few observations: 1) I am arguing that the human race has had a measurable impact on global warming. I acknowledge that natural climate change does happen. I will debate that humans are contributing to recent global warming. 2) My opponent says that quoting a consensus is not science. However, it has to be seen that a scientific study by real scientists is going to be more reliable than some kind of theory or home conducted experiment.  Before we begin I would just like to ask for evidence behind the claims in point 3 just for reference.  I will begin by analyzing my opponents case and then move on to my own.  My opponents 1st point states that there is no hard proof that CO2 from humans is the most important part to causing global warming. Even if itapos;s not the MOST important part, if humans have any impact than we are changing the climate from what is natural. I will provide empirical evidence that in fact it has a huge impact if not the biggest.  2: My opponent argues that the computer models donapos;t work. Even if this is true, there is other evidence that proves CO2 does have an impact. Also, computer models are just a way of prediction and we canapos;t expect them to be 100% correct.  3: My opponent argued that CO2 is a weak greenhouse gas. My opponent argues that water vapor has a stronger green house effect. Even if this is true, adding CO2 to the atmosphere is actually a cause for more humid atmosphere making it worse. So even if you believe my opponent that it is actually the water vapor that is the more disastrous greenhouse gas, this problem stems from CO2 also, which stems from humans. http://www.nasa.gov...  Basically my opponent is stating we would need more CO2 to see an impact which is not a scientific claim and there is an undoubted correlation between CO2 and warming.  4: In response to my opponents claim that their is less CO2 now than ever before, according to Freedman at climate central, quot;CO2 levels are far higher now than they have been for anytime during the past 800,000 years.quot; http://www.climatecentral.org...  Also, from NASA. quot;atmospheric carbon dioxide does naturally fluctuate, but itapos;s never been has high as it is todayquot; http://globalclimate.ucr.edu... (i would recommend looking at this graph for the link provided!  5: Your statement about the temperature increasing for the past 20,000 years is true, however that was when the last severe cold stage in the climate happened. So naturally the climate is on its way to being warmer.  Today though, we are seeing this clearly attributed to CO2 in the air from humans as the temperature goes beyond what would be seen as natural.  As for the political arguments. That is probably all true, but does not prove that humans donapos;t have to do with global warming.  Now for my case:  1: Humans are altering the climate.  My evidence comes in 3 stages.  1: My opponent has acknowledged that CO2 is a green house gas. Green house gasses cause global warming.  2: humans are netting 15 gigatons of carbon into the atmosphere that has no place in the carbon cycle. Prior to industry all carbon fit into the cycle. https://www.newscientist.com...  3: If CO2 causes warming, and humans are omitting extra CO2 that we are having an impact on climate. Thus I hold my claim that humans are impacting climate change.  Some may still remain skeptical in believing that there are things that may not be CO2 causing global warming. While other causes like volcanic eruptions, or the tilt of the earth have had causes thousands of year ago. We are seeing trends in the the atmoshphere that point to CO2 being the cause as opposed to thermal energy. Check out the video here. https://www.skepticalscience.com...</t>

    <t>My opponents first second and third points state, quot;My opponent has acknowledged that CO2 is a green house gas. Green house gasses cause global warming... humans are netting 15 gigatons of carbon into the atmosphere that has no place in the carbon cycle. Prior to industry all carbon fit into the cycle... If CO2 causes warming, and humans are omitting extra CO2 that we are having an impact on climate. Thus I hold my claim that humans are impacting climate change.quot;  To respond to this, I would like to bring up the argument that there is not that much Co2 in the atmosphere compared to the Earths past. 15 gigatons sounds like a lot but it compared to the Earths past Co2 has been much higher. http://www.paulmacrae.com... In addition to this, historical evidence shows that Co2 has no correlation to temperature and most ice core data shows that higher temperature causes Co2 increase, not the other way around.  My opponents next claim is that there are significant quot;fingerprintsquot; caused by Co2 induced heating in the atmosphere. This is not a valid point because I am arguing that Co2 doesnapos;t cause enough heat to significantly impact the atmosphere in the way my opponent is describing. This just brings us in a circle back to the argument that is if CO2 causes warming or not.  My opponents next correlation is that since Venus has high Co2 concentrations and it is known that this is why venus is hot it would make sense that we would be seeing the same effects on Earth.  My response to this is that Venusapos;s atmosphere is 96% Co2. This is more then enough Co2 to have a significant impact on its atmosphere. This is drastically different from Earth where only about .03% of our atmosphere is Co2.  I agree that humans are putting Co2 into the atmosphere  My opponent then states that we are seeing rapid climate changes and that this is unnatural about the current climate change. While we are experiencing rapid rates of climate change, these changes are not unique to Earth. The entire solar system seems to be going through a sort of quot;climate-change phase.quot; Within the last 20 years scientists at NASA and around the world have realized that the planets we are looking at now are different than those in 1900s. This indicates that the entire solar system is in some sort of solar-system wide climate change. For example, the ice caps on Mars are shrinking (indicating warming) and the atmosphere is gaining clouds and ozone, Pluto is experiencing a growth of its mysterious dark spots and is experiencing a 300% increase in atmospheric pressure (indicating warming), Saturn is giving off large amount of x rays and there are new appearances of quot;hot spotsquot; in its atmosphere (indicating warming), there have been polar shifts on Uranus and voyager 2 picked up large storm spots In its atmosphere that were not there 50 years ago (indicating warming), Mercury is growing a magnetic field and polar ice caps, Jupiterquot;s plasma clouds melding together in its atmosphere and becoming brighter (this is theorized to have been caused by an 18 degree Celsius warming and this is supported by the new large storm spots appearing on Jupiter for the first time), Venus has had a 2500% increase in green glow which symbolizes oxygen in the atmosphere, and Neptune is experiencing changes in light intensity. A dramatic shift that may be the cause of all these weird interplanetary changes is that the suns magnetic field is increasing in strength. Over the last 100 years, the suns magnetic field has increased by 230%. This increase attracts stardust from the surrounding area and this overflow of stardust may have something to do with this solar-system wide event. This evidence shows how Earth is not the only planet going through a rapid period of climate change. This indicates that something solar-system wide may be to blame for the recent fluctuations in temperature, not Co2.  In addition to this, compared to the past 100,000 years, the rate of temperature increase does not seem to be any more rapid then it has been in the past. For example, look at this graph. https://conscioustourism.files.wordpress.com... In fact, looking at this graph shows that we are seeing even less fluctuations in temperature then we have in the past. This means that the rate of change and increase is unnatural because it is slow, not fast.  I have now disproven all of your claims and look forward to your next argument. No, thank you for the debate :)</t>

Supporting evidence that the claims of manmade global climate change are dramatically overstated: Weapos;ve seen record total amounts of ice, snow, and cold. Polar bears are thriving. Oceans are rising much less than predicted. -Further note here. Iapos;ve shown multiple times that the predictions of those claiming manmade climate change is going to destroy the world have been incorrect. If these predictions based on the scientific findings are incorrect, perhaps some of their overall claim is also incorrect.

Again, Iapos;m not saying manmade climate change is not real. We are warming the client. I, again, take issue with the quot;threatquot; that everyone is blowing out of proportion.

    <t>My opponent is correct the Earthapos;s temperature has been hotter a long time ago. This falls into the stage 4a of climate change denial. [2] Meaning my opponent accepts the first part of the resolution but rejects the second half.The problem is not the temperature itself, but the rate of change. High rate of temperature change historically has lead to mass extinction. In summary, species including humans will struggle to adapt to such changes, if adaptation to such a change is even possible. [3]Impact, high rate of temperature change equals mass extinctions, which are a threat. Next my opponent uses information sourced from an ultra conservative website called the dailycaller.com I will first attack the source of the argument and then the argument itself. The dailycaller is an ultra-conservative website. You can verify this yourself by seeing the news story against Hilary placed first on the dailycaller.com.quot;ultra-conservative Daily Callerquot; [4]Next, lets take a look at the argument. Basically this is a reiteration of the first argument and again falls into stage 4a of denial. [2]Yes, not all the predictions came true. Yet, the overall premise, that co2 and temperature are rising an alarming rates is true. Thank you for taking the time to debate.

    <t>In this round I will be refuting my opponentapos;s arguments and I will be resupporting my own arguments My opponent statedquot;First my arguments still stand. I think everyone already knows the Pope is not a climate change scientist.quot;But what my opponent fails to realize is that quoting the pope is not an argument, an argument needs evidence, the quote from the Pope is not evidence of climate change, rather it is only a claim followed by my opponentapos;s warrant. You canapos;t just quote the pope and call it an argument, thus you have no first argument. The Popeapos;s statement does not further your case (unless he was a climate scientist, then it would)So, because the pope is not a climate researcher I really donapos;t even need to refute his statement but I have done so by showing that the Pope is not a climate scientist. In his first rebuttal my opponent stated thatquot;science has shown repeatably that CO2 emissions increase green house gasesquot;, but he shows no specific evidence of this occurring. Then my opponent quotes the EPA quot;The main human activity that emits CO2 is the combustion of fossil fuelsquot; However, if this were true then how come the decade long decrease in CO2 was seen, even as fossil fuel combustion increased (In the US alone 3 billion more barrels were used per year). In fact, my opponent conceded that point when he said quot;Why CO2 levels happen to drop that year is uncertainquot;, so my opponent has conceded my first point. My opponent stated in rebuttal 2quot;Argument two is cherry picking.quot;But he shows no evidence of how it is cherry picking... Thus, this statement ought not to be considered, however I will prove how my second argument was not cherry picking... The definition of cherry picking is quot;When only select evidence is presented in order to persuade the audience to accept a position, and evidence that would go against the position is withheld.quot; [1]However, I have not cherry picked evidence because of the fact that I offered the statistical analysis of two major climate research satellites which have had their results peer reviewed by the scientific community and been found to be accurate. In fact, if I had cherry picked this evidence it would not show the .2 degree warming trend that it did...What is even more ironic is that my opponent goes on to say quot;El Nino was responsible for the height of the graph.quot; But even I conceded that the warming trend was there, in fact my opponent just contradicted his entire case by calling the warming trend that was apparent on the graph; El Nino, a regional, natural phenomena, that has nothing to do with Global Climate Change. So, if El Nino caused the warming trend on the graph, then Global Warming is a hoax because all warming trends over the period of the graph can be explained by El Nino (He said it, I didnapos;t). My opponent in rebuttal 3 stated quot;First, any argument that tries to use a regional phenomenon to disprove a global trend is dead in the water. Anthropogenic global warming theory does not predict uniform warming throughout the globe. We need to assess the balance of the evidence.quot;By definition if the phenomena is not experienced GLOBALLY, then GLOBAL Climate Change is not occurring [1] (simple definition 1)quot;Second, ice-sheet thickening is not inconsistent with warming! Warmer climates tend toward more precipitation. The Antarctic is one of the most extreme deserts on the planet. As it warms, we would expect it to receive more snow. But even a whopping warming of 20 degrees quot; say, from -50 degrees C to -30 degrees C quot; would still leave it below freezing, so the snow wouldnapos;tquot;t melt. Thus, an increase in ice mass.quot;If this is true then how come one of the biggest proponents of Global Warming said that the poles would be ice free by 2013 [2], Leon Penetta once said [while talking about Global Climate Change] quot;The melting of the Polar Ice Capsquot; [3]. There seems to be a consensus among scientists and Global Warming Theorists that the Ice caps will melt when Global Warming occurs. Then How did my opponent find contradictory evidence? He found such evidence because he quoted a man with 0 climate science experience. His sources 4,5, and 6 are written by Coby Beck quot;Former musician, turned tree planter, turned software engineer.quot; [4] So, any quote by him ought to be ignored because it offers no expert value or value of any sort. In fact, my opponent is not even quoting the credible science in some of Beckapos;s blogs, my opponent is quoting Beckapos;s opinions which hold no value. My opponent in his 4th rebuttal quotes the same man again... and his statement ought to be ignored but in another one of my opponentapos;s contradictory statements, he says quot;temperature moved first [in relation to CO2]quot;, but if this is true, then how come the IPCC said that CO2 caused temperature to move? Which one is it? Either way my opponent has contradicted Global Warming theory as we are debating it and has negated his own refutation. My opponentapos;s graph is quite interesting. The graph appears to show a correlation between CO2 and Temperature, however there are several occasions of temperature and CO2 acting independently, one major example is 400k years before present when the temperature increased dramatically for a (relatively) short period while CO2 decreased, and then again around 380k years ago where temperature decreased dramatically while CO2 increased. So, my opponentapos;s chart, however intriguing, shows once again, that temperature and CO2 act independently from one another. Now I will Strengthen my original cases1: Fossil Fuels do not cause an increase in CO2 emissions, which makes the first part of the IPCCapos;s basic version of global warming invalidMy opponent has conceded this point (see above for more details)2: Despite common belief the last few years have not been the warmest on recordI have shown my opponentapos;s rebuttal of this claim to be false, and his claim of a logical fallacy to be false, however Iapos;d like to strengthen this point more. USCRN the largest and most advanced climate research network in the US has shown a decade long cooling trend. While the trend is statistically 0, it still shows no evidence of global warming. If the entire world is warming, (definition of Global Warming, see above) then how come the United States isnapos;t? [5]s://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com...; alt=quot;quot; width=quot;1005quot; height=quot;551quot; /gt;Furthering my point, A large integrated network of Argo ocean buoys operated by the British Oceanographic Data Center in combination with satellite-enhanced data reveal no statistical warming. Again I posit the question, If the world is warming, then how come the US AND Britain (and the surrounding ocean) are not. [6] 3: Antarctic Ice was larger than ever in 2012 and 2014, thus the Antarctic Ice caps have not been melting which is thought to be a sideffect of the Global Warming theorySeeing as my opponentapos;s refutation of this point was insufficient, I do not feel the need to strengthen this point. 4: There is no direct link between CO2 Emissions and Temperature IncreasesAs I have refuted my opponentapos;s statements about this point Iapos;d like to point out that my opponent has neglected to mention both of my charts for this point, both of which show an obvious independence between CO2 and Temperature, even over the time span of millions of years of data. Judges, seeing as my opponent has not fulfilled his BoP at this point in the debate you would be required to vote in favor of the Con. I look forward to reading my opponentapos;s next argument, and Iapos;d like to say that Iapos;m enjoying this debate.

    <t>Thank you for posting this debate, I hope to be a worthy opponent!!!!Your argument is based on the popeapos;s opinion as well as a scientific documentaryMy argument will be based on historical evidence as well as current scientific evidence that contradicts the theory of Global Climate ChangeFirst Iapos;d like to clarify that Global Warming and Global Climate Change are the same theory with a different name and I will treat them as such. First, Iapos;d like to define Global Climate Change (or Warming)Thus the theory of Global Climate Change (warming) is - a change in global climate patterns, in particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onward and attributed to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels.Iapos;d like to give a more simplified version of the above statement by giving this general statement released by the IPCC on what Climate Change is quot;Increasing fossil fuel causes increasing carbon dioxide in the air; and increasing carbon dioxide in the air causes climate change.quot;Next, Iapos;d like to refute my opponentapos;s argumentsArgument 1) Pope Francis recognizes climate change and he quot;Knows what he is doing and thus man-made global climate change is real and a threatquot; My Response: Pope Francis has no college degree in science (he does have a quot;tituloquot; as a chemical technician, which is not a college degree) and either way he is not a climatologist and his opinion does not count as an expertapos;s opinion and his opinion is on par with the opinion of world leaders and celebrities... Essentially, his opinion on climate change is just as important as the opinion of Vladimir Putinapos;s, neither count as an expert, but their opinionapos;s count as a World Leaderapos;s opinion. Argument 2) An Inconvenient Truth My Response: I will watch the entirety of this movie so I can refute the movie in my next argumentNow I will give my basic arguments1: Fossil Fuels do not cause an increase in CO2 emissions, which makes the first part of the IPCCapos;s basic version of global warming invalidDuring World War II, U.S. oil production increased by 3 billion barrels annually during the war. Both the Allies and the Axis used incredible amounts of oil and the best scientific data available, which is from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, shows that carbon dioxide levels literally quot;flat-linedquot; during the decade between 1940 and 1950 staying at 311.3 PPM and actually going down between 1941 and 1945, (the period that the US was in the war) [1] So, how did burning another 12+ billion barrels of oil not increase CO2???? Because, there is no direct link between oil usage and CO2 emissions in the atmosphere. Of course CO2 is a byproduct of the burning of oil, but that CO2 has had little to no affect on atmospheric CO2 as seen in my example above.2: Despite common belief the last few years have not been the warmest on record... According to the UAH and RSS climate research satellites there had been no warming between the late 90apos;s and 2015 in fact 2014, was only .01 degrees hotter than 2005, and 2013 was only .02 degrees warmer than 2005. The conclusion from the analysis of the data is that while there has been a .05 degree warming trend since 2002, according to researchers that is quot;statistically insignificantquot; [2] The small upward trend from 1978 to 2015 is .2 degrees Celsius and is once again classifiable as statistically insignificant and is not proof of any man made global warming, in fact the lack of a significant upward trend shows not only that global warming predictions on climate and temperatures have been well off, but that there may not be any man made global warming at all. (excuse the site on the chart, woodfortrees.org is not where I got the chart, the source I used for the chart is the one listed as source 2)3: Antarctic Ice was larger than ever in 2012 and 2014, thus the Antarctic Ice caps have not been melting which is thought to be a sideffect of the Global Warming theoryNASA satillites discovered that the antarctic sea ice had reached a new record high in 2012 and then again in 2014, in 2014 it set a record for the largest Antarctic Sea Ice in recorded history [3]. Global Warming theory dictates that the Ice caps would begin to melt at an alarming rate, but if thatapos;s the case then how come this has occurred. In fact Al Gore and many Global Warming theorists stated that the ice caps would be completley gone by 2013, when the exact opposite has occurred.The red line in the photo is the largest that the ice had ever been recorded at.4: There is no direct link between CO2 Emissions and Temperature Increaseslook at both of the below charts, the first chart is CO2 and temperature data for the last 750 million years, each blue dot represents the temperature and CO2 levels. What you can see is that the dots are everywhere and seemingly when CO2 is raised the dots tend to be higher, but there are several dots (call them outliers if you wish) that even nearing 5000 PPM CO2 are still cooler than the average Earth Temperature. On top of this, why are there dots near the 1000 PPM range that are higher up on the anomaly range than the dots at 7000 PPM.The Second chart shows CO2 and Temperature from 1999 to 2014, what can be seen is a very, very small trend line which is again considered Statistically Insignificant, showing no proof of a global climate change. (specifically the trend is .00668, which is essentially 0 to statisticians) [4]s://s17.postimg.io...; alt=quot;quot; /gt;s://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com...; alt=quot;quot; /gt;Both Charts show a lack of evidence with CO2 and Temperature, In fact, it could be said that there is no correlation between CO2 and Temperature Change. However IPCCapos;s definition of Global Climate Change requires such a correlation and if such a correlation is not apparent than Climate Change theory is flawed and thus Global Climate Change would not exist. So, based on all 4 of my points I am in firm negation of the topic in which we are debating. Thank you for reading this argument and looking at my charts!!! I hope you understood it, and I canapos;t to see your next round.Iapos;d like to remind my opponent of his BoP, which because of him being the pro he must prove specifically that Man Made Climate change is real and a threat he must prove this beyond a shadow of a doubt, my BoP is not to disprove Climate Change but rather to cast a shadow of a doubt, similar to a court case the judges must not have ANY SHADOW OF A DOUBT that he has won or they must give me the victory.Sources: [1]http://data.giss.nasa.gov...[2]http://dailycaller.com...[3]http://www.nasa.gov...[4]https://wattsupwiththat.com...In case the charts/pics dont show up...

    <t>My opponent stated thatquot;First and foremost, my opponent has dropped the issue of the Inconvenient truth documentaryquot; However, my entire case has been in contradiction to the inconvenient truth documentary, as seen when my opponent states quot;scientific evidence clearly backs up this claim in the documentary an inconvenient truthquot;, I have offered scientific in direct contradiction to the scientific evidence in the movie, thus I have negated my opponentapos;s ENTIRE argument. quot; As for the Popeapos;s contribution, this shows just how much climate change deniers are within the minority.quot;Seeing as my opponent likes to spew out the term quot;fallacyquot;, I will spew out the term band wagon fallacy which this argument is, because The bandwagon fallacy is committed by arguments that appeal to the growing popularity of an idea as a reason for accepting it as true. My opponent has admitted to doing this by sating that quot;climate change deniers are within the minorityquot; In my opponentapos;s (rather short) rebuttal he said that I was cherry picking again (in my first argument) He did show that I chose a time fame that best suits me, but that time frame that best suits me shows a DIRECT INDEPENDENCE between oil consumption and CO2 in the atmosphere. This isnapos;t cherry picking because I didnapos;t just show a single year or two of independence I showed an entire decade of data. Not only this, but in my 3rd graph (on my first argument) I showed how CO2 levels has been extremely higher than weapos;ve ever seen in humanityapos;s history (in some cases over 8000 PPM well before the industrial revolution). Once again I showed independence between ATMOSPHERIC CO2 and Fossil Fuel Consumption. My opponent doesnapos;t seem to understand my argument that ATMOSPHERIC CO2 has no direct relationship to fossil fuel consumption, he lists the obvious fact that CO2 is released by the burning of fossil fuels, but shows no explanation to why an entire decade (and more) of data shows no relation between fossil fuel consumption and atmospheric CO2, in fact he drops the point in his second argument when he says he cannot explain why this statistic occurred. My opponentapos;s second rebuttal statesquot;My opponent seems to miss the original claim he/she made. I have shown that the overall trend is upwards. El nino was particularly potent in the spike of the graph.quot;I havenapos;t forgotten any claims that I have made, however my opponent has not shown anything contrary to my original claim, his only counter argument negates his entire argument when my opponent blames the spike in temperature on El Nino, a climate feature unrelated to Global Warming. But again even I admitted there was a slight warming trend since 1978, but if the El Nino spike is removed from the data the trend disappears, so my opponent admits that Global Warming is not the cause of the temperature since 1978. My opponentapos;s third rebuttal states quot;The overall tend is hotter. Climate can be difficult to predict, just because not everything predicted came true at the correct time, doesnapos;t destroy the overall premise is false.quot;However I have shown 3 different examples of a lack of an overall warming trend. My first example being my 1st chart on my first argument, which shows that GLOBALLY the overall warming trend (that there is) is quot;statistically insignificantquot; (since 1978). My second example shows that in the US temperatures are cooling over the last decade. My third example shows that in the North and East Atlantic Ocean, as well as, the British Isles have not experienced any warming. My opponentapos;s fourth rebuttal statesquot;The graph clearly indicates that Co2 and temperature show a strong positive relationship. Yes, there are a few anomalies but that doesnapos;t discredit the theory.quot;My opponent has offered one singular graph showing a relationship between CO2 and temperature. However, I have pointed out that there are events on his graph that shows an independence between the two variables, on top of this, I have offered TWICE as much evidence in the contrary, which my opponent has neglected to mention, showing independence between the two variables even over millions of years. Again Iapos;d like to crystalize my arguments1: Fossil Fuels do not cause an increase in CO2 emissions, which makes the first part of the IPCCapos;s basic version of global warming invalidMy opponent has not other a sufficient refutation for this argument, because this point refutes the definition of Global Warming, it proves that, as we are debating it, Global Warming is not real and thus not a threat.2: Despite common belief the last few years have not been the warmest on record... My opponent calls this point quot;cherry pickingquot; however as I have proven, this is not true, and because my opponent has not offered contrary evidence and because of that this point still stands3: Antarctic Ice was larger than ever in 2012 and 2014, thus the Antarctic Ice caps have not been melting which is thought to be a sideffect of the Global Warming theoryMy opponentapos;s first reputation was to say that the ice caps would not melt if Global Warming occurred, however I have shown that this is false, then my opponent made a refutation that is not in contradiction to anything that I stated, so this point still stands.4: There is no direct link between CO2 Emissions and Temperature IncreasesMy opponent has neglected to mention either of my graphs and my opponentapos;s evidence has been refuted making this point still relevant in this debate. Now Iapos;d like to show why I have won this debate My opponentapos;s arguments have been proven false or a fallacy. My opponentapos;s first quot;pointquot; is the popeapos;s quote which Iapos;ve shown to be worth no value to this debate, and I have proven it to be a bandwagon fallacy. My opponentapos;s second point is the Inconvenient Truth Movie which posits scientific evidence for the theory of Global Warming, However, my entire case is in direct contradiction to this movie and acts as counter evidence and a rebuttal to the movie. So, because both of my opponentapos;s arguments have been proven wrong, and my opponentapos;s refutations have been untrue and unfounded, and I have proven them to be so, Thus, I have won this debate... Judges must vote in favor of the Con because of the overwhelming amount of evidence presented and the lack of evidence for my opponent.  Iapos;d like to thank my opponent for this fun and enlightening debate.</t>

    <t>RebuttalsFirst my arguments still stand. I think everyone already knows the Pope is not a climate change scientist. Opponentapos;s arguments.1. Fossil Fuels do not cause an increase in CO2 emissions, which makes the first part of the IPCCapos;s basic version of global warming invalidThis is overtly false, since science has shown repeatably that CO2 emissions increase green house gases. This is also stage 3c of climate change denial.

These warming periods lasted for 5,000 to 10,000 years (the cooling periods lasted more like 100,000 years!), so for the majority of that time (90% and more), temperature and CO2 rose together. quot;show picture of graph if possible.quot; [6][7]Antartica ice provides supporting evidence due to increase snow fall in sub freezing tempatures.

    <t>Defending my arguments.First and foremost, my opponent has dropped the issue of the Inconvenient truth documentary. I made this argument in r1 and thus far has been uncontested. I have fulfilled my burden of proof with this documentary in round one. As for the Popeapos;s contribution, this shows just how much climate change deniers are within the minority. Argument one, burning of fossil fuels increase Co2.Iapos;ve shown that the EPA states that burning of fossil fuels increase the greenhouse gas of CO2. I was unable to figure out why CO2 levels dropped during the time interval of 1940-1950. Yet, I did show that by my opponentapos;s same graph CO2 levels have risen dramatically. In 1850 with Co2 at 285.2 ppm and in the year 2011 391.15 ppm. This is a cherry picking fallacy, my opponent has chosen a time frame that best suits him/her despite the obvious overall trend of higher concentrations of CO2.quot;The two main byproducts of natural gas combustion are carbon dioxide and water vaporquot; [8]As you can see the combustion of natural gas causes carbon dioxide, Co2 emissions. 2.

    <t>Global warming is caused by the emission of greenhouse gases . 72% of the totally emitted greenhouse gases is carbon dioxide (CO2), 18% Methane and 9% Nitrous oxide (NOx). Carbon dioxide emissions therefore are the most important cause of global warming. CO2 is inevitably created by burning fuels like e.g. oil, natural gas, diesel, organic-diesel, petrol, organic-petrol, ethanol. The emissions of CO2 have been dramatically increased within the last 50 years and are still increasing by almost 3% each year, see graph below:      Word-wide CO2 emission are steadily increasingGraph 1: CO2-emissions world-wide by year (data from wri.org)  World-wide CO2 emissions and concentrationsGraph 2: CO2 emissions world-wide by year and CO2 concentration in the atmosphere by year  The carbon dioxide is released to the atmosphere where it remains for 100 to 200 years. This leads to an increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere (see above on the right hand side), which in turn causes the average temperature on Earth to raise (see graph below).  Increase of world temperature Chart 3: Increase of global average temperature for the last 20 years (source: wri.org) Recent investigations have shown that inconceivable catastrophic changes in the environment will take place if the global temperatures increase by more than 2° C (3.6° F). A warming of 2° C (3.6° F) corresponds to a carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration of about 450 ppm (parts per million) in the atmosphere.</t>

    <t>In fact, over the last decade, the rate of climate change has been declining, despite the fact that we use more Co2 emitting energy sources. Now, I believe that Co2 has a small effect on the climate, but there is simply no evidence saying that we will die. And fossil fuels can be used to make countries stronger in the face of the effects some scientists hypothesise will effect them the most. for instance, fossil fuels can actually be used to make stronger structures and communities that can easily bounce back from devastating natural disasters. For instance, there is a correlation between fossil fuel and clean water, this is because fossil fuel can be used to power refineries and the entire pipe system used to get water to the tap. Now, of course all this energy can be found in other energy sources, such as nuclear and hydroelectric, but I suppose that you want to talk about wind and solar right? After all they are free supposedly? Well, not true, in fact, it is quite pricy, just to get the rare resources to make solar panels. But in inclusion to the solar panels and wind power, youapos;d need a reliable alternate. After all, the sun isnapos;t shining all the time and the wind isnapos;t blowing all the time. This is why despite the fact that Germany has invested so much in solar and wind energy, they have more coal plants then ever. And this in turn has caused some to go in to quot;energy povertyquot; I hope this clears up why we canapos;t elect a president with no experience just because of climate change.  Now, Iapos;d like to talk about the flaws in Jills other plans. She would like to raise taxes on the rich. Of course this sound like a great plan, after all, virtually everyone (including me) thinks the rich should pay their fair share. But the top 10% already pay 70% of government funding. And not only that, but research shows that the laffer curve for the rich indicated that the revenue collected from them INCREACES then taxes on them are DECREASED. Weird right? Well it turns out that when the rich know that less of their money is going to govt, they are far more willing to spend it. This also often indicates that they are putting money into their business, meaning they are probably hiring more people. And luckily for me Gary Johnsons tax plan will allow this to happen.  And again, Jills environmental plan was tried in Germany, and as I said, failed.  Her minimun wage of 15 will put far to may people out of work.  Thanks for the debate and I look forward to the response.</t>

    <t>With the environment becoming increasingly an issue I think its a high time we elect a green party representative. The fact that Jill is both a woman and a Harvard graduate aids her. This is because she will be the first woman president if elected. I think it is high time we break the trend of all male presidents. A Harvard degree is no small task. quot;She graduated magna cum laude from Harvard College in 1973, and from Harvard Medical School in 1979.quot; [0]Compare this to Gary Johnsonapos;s degree from the university of New Mexico. quot;While studying at the University of New Mexico, Gov. Johnson started a handyman business as means to achieve financial independence. After graduating with a degree in political science in 1975, his company, Big J Enterprises, expanded into remodeling and renovation, and eventually, construction. quot; [1]Therefore, there are three areas in which Jill has an advantage over Gary. First she focuses more on the enviorment than Gary. Second, she is a woman, which would make her the first female president. Third, she has a more prestigious degree than Johnson. Why is the environment so important? If we donapos;t act soon, as early as 2034 climate change will be out of control. Meaning only a supreme being could save the human race at that point. quot;in fact, the report shows we might exceed a 2 C increase as early as 2034.quot; [2]We have to act now. The end of days is upon us unless we get our acts together. There can be no liberty, justice, nor freedom for anyone under such conditions. Nevertheless, there is plenty of climate change deniers. Both in elected offices and the masses. [3]quot;63% of those with no post-school qualifications were unconvinced about the role of humans in producing climate changeUniversity graduates were much more likely to take the opposite view, with 86% agreeing that human activity was responsiblequot; [4]This means 37% of people with no post-school qualifications donapos;t believe in man made climate change. This is huge, we need to bring awareness to as many people as possible and act accordingly. Pope Francis believes climate change is a threat and so do scientists. Meanwhile, Gary seems to take a weak stance on environmental issues. If nothing else electing Jill Stein will send a strong message that climate change is real. The time to act is now before it is too late.

    <t>Pros for JohnsonI would like to first talk about Johnsonapos;s time as a republican. While I normally donapos;t find it important to bring up, but people often bring it up, but Johnsonapos;s achievements as a Republican are not meaningless just because he is now a Libertarian, for as a republican, Johnson upheld a strictly Libertarian sort of Raegan Coolidge like platform, so nothing really changed except party. Now I would like to talk about his time as governer of New Mexico. He achieved a huge approval ration in a state where democrats out number republicans 2 to 1. He also left a statte previously struggling terribly with budget problems with a huge 1 dolar billion budget surpluss. He also constructed two privately funded prisons, meaning the government doesnapos;t pay for it. He vetoes more costly bills then all other governers combined. He also started a major road building program and shifted medicaid to a more efficient managed care. I think that these show that Johnson would be a very solid choice for presidentCons for Jill Stein Unlike a debate between Ms. Clinton and Mr. Trump, I speculate that this debate will mostly be left up to the pros, not the cons. I canapos;t really criticize Jill Stein to much because she has never held an elective office. Which simply leaves me with lack of experience. We canapos;t simply let someone who has little to no knowledge of how to work in government.  And Jill Stein graduating Harvard cannot be used to soldify her claims, as no political courses were taken, and she only took medical related courses.</t>

    <t>Iapos;m not against having a woman, but I always stand by having the most qualified person do the job, and that making sure we have a woman president shouldnapos;t be our top priority. Now your claim that Jill Stein has a more prestigious degree is true in fact, but agin, its not a political degree, meanwhile Gary Johnson has a degree in political science. Would you hire a Harvard medical doctor as a lawyer? No, of course not, you would want someone who has a degree in the given field, right?  And the environmental claims are one field, and an iffy field at that. The environment is something extremely hard to predict, and science often predicts it wrong. And while I donapos;t personally believe that man made climate change is as big as you stated, but we do have an 8,000,000,000 dolars department called the Environmental Protection Agency.  Now onto the aspects that Jill loses to Gary Johnson, other than having no political degree and has never holding elective office. First, Gary Johnson will be for better at improving our economy, he would implement the same acts as he did while governor of New Mexico, which left the horribly budgeted state with a huge surplus. Jill has not proven herself prominent in this category, again, because she is not experienced. She also fails to address Americas terrible budget problem. The congressional budget office states that by the end of the 2016 FY, Congress will have gone 534 billion dolars over there budget, as usual. What has Jill agreed to do?</t>

    <t>Your lack of rebuttals makes me think youapos;re stumped. You only responded to one thing I said because you think it is the only important thing I said, and didnapos;t even bother to bring up the evidence I used to support it. You simply said that Co2 levels are higher then we expected. Which is not what I said was expected, what I said is that a warming trend is expected, as we have recently entered an inter galacial period as part of the paleostine ice age. You see, the climate is constantly changing, and my point was that the Co2 theory is becoming more and more flawed. Now you bring up hurricanes, again, this is all part of the warming trend. And anyway, if you really do want to help countries in danger because of hurricanes, then you are on the wrong path. When a developed country gets hit by a hurricane, the effects are far less devastating than when a hurricane or typhoon hits a less developed country. Mainly because of low quality shelter. This causes that countryapos;s economy to crash. So if you are really concerned about hurricane damage, then get of the problem of climate change, and focus on bringing those countries out of poverty.  Now on to your claim of Co2 levels. Now, the term carbon emissions is wrong, as it is not just carbon, but carbon dioxide. And every single form of fossil fuel is made of it, and all of that Co2 was once in our atmosphere. And for most of our planets existence, Co2 levels were far higher than they are today. Now, Co2 levels cannot be used to blame your stated problems on. For instance, low plant growth, if anything, can be blamed on low Co2 levels, as the optimal level for plant growth is 4x higher then ours today. And our high levels of Co2, as noted by satellite imagery, are actually making the Earth greener in terms of plant growth, as plants and forests begin to regrow at noticeably fast rates.  Now, I have made legitimate claims and backed them up accordingly, and I would appreciate it if you acknowledge these claims, instead of cherry picking for one group of words to attack.</t>

You provide no outside links on this subject. quot; The last time there was this much carbon dioxide (CO2) in the Earthapos;s atmosphere, modern humans didnapos;t exist. Megatoothed sharks prowled the oceans, the worldapos;s seas were up to 100 feet higher than they are today, and the global average surface temperature was up to 11°F warmer than it is now.As we near the record for the highest CO2 concentration in human history — 400 parts per million — climate scientists worry about where we were then, and where weapos;re rapidly headed now.quot; [2]As you can see we are about to break the record for highest CO2 concentrations in human history 400 parts per million. All signs indicates the concentration will get higher and higher. Your claim about plants growing faster is also flawed. quot;But an unprecedented three-year experiment conducted at Stanford University is raising questions about that long-held assumption. Writing in the journal Science, researchers concluded that elevated atmospheric CO2 actually reduces plant growth when combined with other likely consequences of climate change -- namely, higher temperatures, increased precipitation or increased nitrogen deposits in the soil. quot; [3]You dispute mainstream science and popular opinion with weak arguments.

I have only debates on this subject before in a debate talking about the 97% statistic, and for the sake of time, I will leave a link to that to explain why the 97% statistic is untrue.  http://tinyurl.com...  Now onto the rest. Science is highly unreliable when in the climate sphere. Back in the 70s virtually every scientist agreed that we were going into a massive ice age, and now they have flip flopped and now think the globe is warming. Science has been doing this forever, one weakly supported claim is said so much that it basically becomes fact. Also, reliable science shows that we are coming out of a minor ige age. So this warming trend it natural. Also, the climate is constantly changing, and it has been doing so since it was formed billions of years ago. For us to think that it is controllable or that we caused it is completely unethical. My whole point is that science argues more against climate change then for it, and itapos;s not that hard to understand, its really common sense.  Also, I understand that ice is melting and sea levels are rising. But a recent study shows that while arctic sea ice is melting antarctic sea ice is expanding. Another study shows that the sea level rise rate has decreased.  And your comment to the pope is completely irrational. The Popeapos;s opinion is not fact, just because he is a figure head for the Catholic church doesnapos;t mean he speaks for it. You can be Catholic and still disagree with what the pope says.  Basically, science says that the warming trend is natural and expected, we are coming out of a little ice age and we will be fine, the Roman Warm period was warmer and they had no carbon emissions to blame it on, just because things are changing and the public didnapos;t know enough to expect it doesnapos;t mean we blame it on something based on the first half-baked argument we hear.</t>

    <t>The greenhouse effect is a thing, and hypothetically it would raise temperatures. But adding more and more to our atmosphere does not infinitely raise the temperature, it only raises it to an extent. Yet again I see you have ignored the very important claim that we are coming out of a galatial period, which explains the warming trend, and everything you think it has caused.  Also, few climate scientists actually worry where we are headed, those are environmental activists, corrupt politicians, and a few scientists hired specifically to prove it is man made. In most cases, you will see that studies that indicate a rapid change are botched, as seen in my 97% debate.  And may I ask you some questions you are free to answer in the comments, what have you done. Are you yelling about a problem you are part of? Do you drive an electric car? Do you plant? Have you actually gone out as I have and contribute to a worthy solution?  And what does population have anything to do with climate change?  Also, may I end with an argument that I may have benifited from starting with. The only constant is change. When the media makes these claims, they leave so much out of the picture. As you have done with my arguments. They take one thing, leave out the rest, which makes it easy to destroy its foundation.

    <t>Thanks for the debate and good luck!  My opponent unfortunately makes some shallow assumptions, in that they believe Donald Trump legitimately believes everything heapos;s said. Remember, my opponent has the burden of proof, and as such must prove beyond reasonable doubt that Trump actually believes this during the course of this debate. Failure to do so means a lack of his fulfillment of his burden of proof and thus means the negative wins the debate. I donapos;t need to show that Trump DOESNapos;T believe this, just show that there isnapos;t enough evidence to demonstrate that he does. I can further explain the burden of proof in a later round if this becomes an issue or is confusing somehow, but Iapos;ll leave this where it is for now and move onto my main contentions.  As I said earlier, my opponent just quotes Trump at face value and assumes that is enough to assert that this is what he believes. However, itapos;s a well known fact that politicians in general will fake beliefs to pander to a specific audience. Looking back at his history as a candidate, itapos;s common knowledge that Trump already had his supporters locked down early in the republican primaries and really couldnapos;t do anything to lose his supporters, even claiming he could shoot someone in the middle of the road and not lose support. A potential reason for him faking belief in climate change then could be to pander to Cruz supporters, of which only 38% believed in climate change. This is a clear reason for Trump to pander to a specific audience in order to get votes, which gives us a motivation for Trumpapos;s actions. http://www.huffingtonpost.com...  Trump even has told people that he has a strategy of saying odd things in order to attract the audience of different groups. Take for example what Carson reported after discussing the matter with Trump himself: quot;I needed to know that he could listen to other people, that he could change his opinions, and that some of the more outlandish things that hequot;s said, that he didnquot;t really believe those things,quot; Carson said. When asked which statements Trump might back away from, Carson demurredquot;. quot;Iquot;ll let him talk about that because I donquot;t think itquot;s fair for me to relay a private conversation,quot; he said.  Read more: http://therightscoop.com...  How can my opponent say for certain that Trump fully believes this if thereapos;s evidence of him saying that heapos;ll back away from some of the more outlandish claims, and that he doesnapos;t necessarily believe all of it? My opponent even recognized in the comments section that this is a somewhat outlandish and silly claim for Trump to make. Weapos;ve seen Trump back away from policies such as the muslim ban, so why assume that this is his actual belief? Unfortunately my opponent uses mostly personal speculation and does not consider the large body of compelling evidence casting doubt over Trumpapos;s actual beliefs.  With that Iapos;ll give pro a chance to respond to my contentions. Thank you!</t>

    <t>In other words you claim Donald Trump is a compulsive liar who will say anything to turn heads. The fact that Donald Trump words suggest that Donald Trump thinks Climate Changeis a hoax does not matter. Iapos;ll accept that. Politicians are know to lie. I know its the 3rd round, but you literally have not given me any option, other than to create a new argument in the 3rd round, so here it goes.Actions speak louder than wordsDonald Trump destroyed a scientific area of interest and natural habitat in order to build a golf course in Scotland.

    <t>Alright...  So first of all, the burden of proof means YOU have the burden of demonstrating your claim to be true beyond a reasonable doubt. *I* just have to demonstrate that itapos;s not necessarily true.

Anyway, my contentions havenapos;t been addressed at all...

    <t>Ok so my opponent conceded the first 2 rounds of the debate and decided to bring a completely new contention the very last round. The problem here is that he also basically concedes that if I were to demonstrate that Trump is greedy enough to just not care about it then thatapos;s sufficient to win the debate.  A quick Google search reveals an article in which Trump literally states quot;I am very greedyquot; [1]  Itapos;s a well known fact that Trunp is excessively greedy, he even says it himself.

    <t>Addressing the first prong of my argument concerning the leftward lean of journalists generally and the St. Petersburg/Tampa Bay Times specifically, Conservative Democrat wrote:  quot;(T)his doesnapos;t prove that PoliticFact [sic] is biased unless we have other evidence as well.quot;  The debate challenge does not ask for proof. The debate challenge asks whether PolitiFact has a liberal bias. The bias among journalists and at PolitiFactapos;s parent newspaper offer reasonable grounds for thinking PolitiFact leans left. The first prong is not meant as proof, for the debate challenge does not require proof.  Itapos;s a bit late to amend the rules of the debate, such as they are.  Addressing my second prong, regarding PolitiFactapos;s failure to provide a principled distinction between its quot;Falsequot; and quot;Pants on Firequot; ratings, Conservative Democrat wrote:  quot;No, they did state why they give some claims False and some Pants on Fire. (...) For example; False claim: I am leading over my opponent in Poll A - But you were not leading; Pants on Fire: I am leading in every poll - But your opponent actually is beating you in many polls.quot;  Where I inserted the ellipsis, Conservative Democrat simply repeated the description of the ratings like one I had already supplied. The remainder of Conservative Democratapos;s answer offers example as a substitute for principle. But why is a string of wrong statements not merely wrong but in addition quot;ridiculousquot;? PolitiFact never states any such difference in terms of principle. When pressed on the matter during a 2014 podcast interview, PolitiFact editor Angie Drobnic Holan said quot;(T)he line between quot;Falsequot; and quot;Pants on Firequot; is just, you know, sometimes we decide one way and sometimes decide the otherquot; (1). Her statement does not provide any principled distinction between one rating and the other.  Providing an example in rebuttal without identifying the principle in the example counts as a failed rebuttal.  Again addressing the second prong, this time in terms of the PolitiFactapos;s tendency to more likely grade Republican false statements quot;Pants on Firequot; than those of Democrats, Conservative Democrat wrote (accounting for the next few sections of quoted text):  quot;Regardless of whether the rating is subjective or not, there is still a reason for this.quot;  If the reasons follow no objective principle then the ratings are effectively subjective and the disparity in the ratings shows PolitiFactapos;s liberal bias.  quot;Republicans are generally more religious then liberals, so many donapos;t believe in evolution.quot;  PolitiFact rarely rates claims touching the issue of evolution. If Conservative Democrat can offer as much as one example of such rated quot;Pants on Firequot; then the point would be at least slightly interesting. But even then it does not turn my third prong.  quot;Many also donapos;t believe in Global Warming.quot;  Conservative Democrat might have cited that factoid to PolitiFact. Unfortunately, the example plays to my advantage in this debate. PolitiFact does not bring scientific rigor to its ratings on global warming, and in fact sometimes reverses its rating principles on the topic. PolitiFact uses a quot;burden of proofquot; standard in its statement of principles. If politician does not support a claim and PolitiFact cannot support it with evidence, PolitiFact calls the claim false (2). Yet a Democrat can say quot;It is true that thereapos;s virtually no Republican who accepts the science that virtually is unanimousquot; and PolitiFact gives it a quot;Mostly Truequot; rating despite the fact that most Republicans have offered no statement of their beliefs on climate change (3). PolitiFact will sometimes simply trash its own principles in favor of a popular public narrative. When a Republican does not offer a position on climate change, does it follow that the Republican does not accept the science? Is that logical? When a fact-checker abandons its principles to favor one side of a debate, itapos;s a solid sign of bias.  quot;(M)ore Republicans will get fact checked, so more of them will make quot;Pants on Firequot; statements.quot;  The research takes that into account. It does not look merely at which party receives more quot;Pants on Firequot; ratings but instead at which partyapos;s false statements are more likely to receive quot;Pants on Firequot; statements. If the proportions were equal, Republicans could have 20 times more quot;Pants on Firequot; statements but the research would show no evidence of bias by that measure. Conservative Democrat misstates the nature of the evidence.  quot;Liberals are generally more intelligent then conservativesquot;  Whatapos;s the relevance, other than affording the opportunity to use a citation? If itapos;s not relevant, itapos;s not an intelligent move to include that factoid.  quot;So why would the apparently liberal PoliticFact [sic] allow PoliticFact [sic] Wisconsin to not be liberally biased? What is more likely is that the claims Wisconsin Democrats make are more likely to be false then the Republican statements.quot;  How would PolitiFact National stop PolitiFact Wisconsin from favoring Republicans in its selections of quot;Pants on Firequot; statements? Thereapos;s no use asking why if thereapos;s no how. The notion that Wisconsin Democrats are more likely to make false statements lacks any evidence in support (using PolitiFact statistics would beg the question), and more importantly Conservative Democrat should note that both quot;Falsequot; and quot;Pants on Firequot; ratings supposedly indicate false statements. It doesnapos;t solve the mystery to say that Wisconsin Democrats more likely make more false claims. Thatapos;s irrelevant to a disparity in the chances of the application of the quot;Pants on Firequot; rating.  Turning attention to the third prong of my argument, Conservative Democrat wrote:  quot;First off, PoliticFact didnapos;t use, quot;The wrong denominator nine times.quot; Your source says they miscalculated 9 times.quot;  Thereapos;s no discrepancy. Using the wrong denominator results in a miscalculation of percentage error (4). My source says as much, but in different words (quot;It is incorrect to divide by the incorrect estimate, 175 lbsquot; (5)). The thing you divide by is the denominator.  quot;If this site was liberally biased, why even allow the republicans any bonuses?quot;  That was explained. Wrong procedures by poor fact checkers are more likely to favor the fact-checkerapos;s ideology. quot;More likelyquot; does not mean quot;exclusively.quot; Lack of bias would mean no pattern of one party receiving more unfair harm than the other. Any other understanding represents a straw man.  quot;we donapos;t get any links to the miscalcuations [sic].  The source links to a spreadsheet that identifies every case in question.  quot;There were 6 calculation errors (apparently) that helped Democrats. This means they have a .9% chance of making an error in favor of a Democrat.quot;  That statement shows a lack of understanding of the research. The search strand provided a suitably random sample of PolitiFactapos;s work looking for one type of calculation. A sample looking for special cases. Your conclusion doesnapos;t follow at all.  quot;Look at the democratic chart on this website. That hardly looks like they are helping democrats much.quot;  Thatapos;s unresponsive to the point. We have no baseline from which to judge the fairness of the charts. Your opinion is only evidence of your opinion. Maybe the Democrats made more false claims.  Conservative Democrat dealt briefly with my fourth prong:  quot;A) You didnapos;t show how this is a liberal bias.quot;  Did. quot;If PolitiFact Nationalapos;s worst work favors Democrats over Republicans, then it serves as an evidence of PolitiFact Nationalapos;s liberal bias.quot;  quot;B) You are focusing on an unrelated part of this fact check.quot;  Biased fact-checkers are more likely to commit and sustain a blunder that agrees with their bias. How is that not related?  quot;C) This is out of context.quot;  Based on what evidence? How can rising costs ever reduce a deficit in any context?  quot;Government spending stimulates the economy.quot;  The only way that could lead to deficit reduction is when taxes are collected on the increased economic activity (revenue, just like I said). But you donapos;t get back more than you spend, do you?  quot;D) Again, what does this mean? You didnapos;t explain how this proves a liberal bias.quot;  Do I need to repeat myself? PolitiFactapos;s apparent incompetence favored the liberal position. I donapos;t need proof. I just need reasonable evidence, as Iapos;ve already explained.  As this stage of the debate shows, Conservative Democrat has failed to refute any prong of my argument. PolitiFactapos;s institutional bias probabilistically shows a liberal bias, two research projects show strong evidence of PolitiFactapos;s liberal bias, and Conservative Democrat has no counter to my anecdotes.  Conservative Democrat summarized: quot;So of these 4, you failed to back up 2 of them, one of these quot;biasesquot; is out of context, and the other one is nitpicking.quot;  Iapos;ve explained why each of your criticisms ring hollow.  quot;It is not my job to prove PoliticFact [sic] is not biased, when no evidence to the contrary exists.quot;  I said that if you do not refute each prong of my argument then you need your own affirmative evidence. Thatapos;s perfectly true, despite your (straw man) hint that I improperly shift the burden of proof. You havenapos;t refuted any part of my argument (evidence in my reply above), nor have you provided your own affirmative case. Based on our arguments, it is reasonable to conclude that PolitiFact has a liberal bias. All of the evidence is on my side.  (1) http://www.politifactbias.com... (2) http://www.politifact.com...

  <pair id="90" entailment="ENTAILMENT" task="IE">
    <t>I offer thanks to quot;Conservative Democratquot; for extending this challenge. PolitiFactapos;s leftward lean does not yet receive the full attention it deserves, so I appreciate the opportunity to make the case.  The fact checkers at PolitiFact, referring to PolitiFact National, have a liberal bias. My argument will make this clear based on a preponderance of the evidence. While that should prove sufficient for the argument to succeed based on the terms of the debate, this argument should also convince the audience beyond a reasonable doubt that PolitiFact National has a liberal bias.  Whatapos;s the evidence?  First, American journalists as a group are to the left of the general U.S. population (1). Second, PolitiFact was created by the St. Petersburg Times (now the Tampa Bay Times), a newspaper with a notable history of partiality to the left. For example, the newspaper has never in over 100 years endorsed a Republican in the general presidential election (2). The most important evidence, though, comes from PolitiFactapos;s content, not from the likely predispositions of its writers and editors or the editorial history of its parent newspaper. Three lines of evidence together make a strong case that the liberal lean at the Times manifests itself in PolitiFactapos;s fact checking. The first two lines come from research. The third derives from PolitiFactapos;s poorest attempts at fact-checking, which tend to unfairly harm Republicans while sparing Democrats.  The first research project (3) uses PolitiFactapos;s rating scale to show unjustified harm to Republicans compared to Democrats. The research focuses on the difference between the quot;Falsequot; and quot;Pants on Firequot; Truth-O-Meter ratings.  A continuing research project I designed provides a powerful evidence of the bias at PolitiFact National. PolitiFactapos;s failure to provide any objective means of distinguishing between its quot;Falsequot; and quot;Pants on Firequot; ratings strongly suggests the ratings reflect an editorial opinion about select statements PolitiFact finds false. PolitiFact decides its ratings based on the vote of three (possibly more) editors (4). The research project randomly surveyed about a quarter of PolitiFactapos;s quot;Pants on Firequot; ratings in search of an unstated objective principle justifying the ratings. The findings showed nothing close to a consistent result, supporting the hypothesis that PolitiFact has no objective justification backing its quot;Pants on Firequot; ratings (5).  The 2012 study showed the apparently subjective quot;Pants on Firequot; rating was 74 percent more likely to fall on a Republican false statement than a Democrat false statement, covering the years from 2007 through 2011. At the end of 2014, updated statistics showed that Republicans were still 74 percent more likely to have their false (by PolitiFactapos;s reckoning) statements rated quot;Pants on Firequot; than those of Democrats (6).  The same research approach was applied to other PolitiFact franchises, including its state and quot;PunditFactquot; franchises. The franchises that deliver the most robust volume of data show fairly consistent trends which do not necessarily track with the trend at PolitiFact National. PolitiFact Wisconsin, for example, tends to give Democratsapos; false statements harsher treatment than those from Republicans by more likely giving them the quot;Pants on Firequot; designation (7).  The other research project was based on reasoning that journalists could be expected to make a common math error more often in cases where the error favored their ideology. Using the often-made error of using the wrong denominator when calculating percentage error, the research project used a search routine to collect a set of PolitiFact stories that might contain percentage error calculations. The research approach turned up a small sample of stories with that equation present, yet the results were lopsided. Out of 14 examples reasonably classified as percentage error calculations, PolitiFact used the wrong denominator nine times (8).  Out of those nine errors, six either unfairly harmed a Republican or helped a Democrat. Three either helped a Republican or harmed a Democrat (9).  The third line of evidence comes from an examination of PolitiFact Nationalapos;s poorest work. If PolitiFact Nationalapos;s worst work favors Democrats over Republicans, then it serves as an evidence of PolitiFact Nationalapos;s liberal bias. The strength of that evidence depends on the strength of the anecdotes offered in illustration. Iapos;ll provide examples as space allows.  A) PolitiFact Florida ruled that a Republican candidate raised his own pay a number of times while serving in the U.S. House of Representatives (10) A later parallel fact check by PolitiFact Ohio rated a Republican candidateapos;s claim that his Democratic opponent had raised his own pay in the House. The reason? PolitiFact Ohio correctly said the rules prevent representatives from raising their own pay (11). Though it involves PolitiFact Florida, this example contributes to the argument because the writer (Louis Jacobson) principally writes for PolitiFact National (12).  B) A PolitiFact defense of the ACA absurdly counted the ACAapos;s projected deficit reductions as spending cuts to help justify rating the ad of a conservative group quot;False.quot; PolitiFact claimed the Congressional Budget Office said the ACA would cut spending by 124 billion (13). But the CBO actually said the ACA would cut the budget deficit by 124 billion dolars(14). Spending is not the same as the budget deficit. This PolitiFact Florida item was written by Angie Drobnic Holan, now chief editor at PolitiFact.  C) PolitiFact found it quot;Mostly Truequot; President Obamaapos;s claim that health care was the single biggest factor driving down the budget deficit, despite the fact that health care costs were increasing (15). The only things that can shrink the budget deficit are costs that drop or revenues that go up. Slowing the growth of a category of costs does not decrease the budget deficit (16).  D) During one of his State of the Union addresses, President Obama mentioned the 23-cent gender wage gap, called it quot;wrongquot; and said women deserve equal pay for equal work. PolitiFact ruled that Obama was correct that a 23-cent wage gap exists, docking him only for an apples-to-oranges aspect of the statistic. PolitiFact said Obamaapos;s call for equal pay for equal work was not part of his gender pay gap claim, excusing the former as quot;aspirationalquot; (17). The Washington Post Fact Checker disagreed, finding Obama implied the gap was relevant to gender discrimination (18).  In the space remaining, Iapos;ll address the argument that PolitiFact gives Republicans worse rating as a group than Democrats.  By itself, more poor ratings for Republicans says essentially nothing about bias at PolitiFact. Bad ratings for Republicans might occur because Republicans make more false statements. However, when we consider Republicansapos; poor record with PolitiFact in context, it serves as an additional, albeit weak, evidence of PolitiFactapos;s liberal bias.  It is important to note that we have no scientifically supported baseline for which political party makes more false claims. So when PolitiFact rates Republicans more harshly than Democrats, it supports no reasonable prediction about PolitiFactapos;s ratings matching a known tendency. On the other hand, knowing that journalists lean left makes it reasonable to predict that if that bias affects PolitiFactapos;s ratings then it may result in harsher ratings for Republicans. The harsh ratings for Republicans support a prediction associated with the hypothesis that PolitiFact has a liberal bias.  So, it is reasonable to conclude that PolitiFact has a liberal bias because journalists tend to lean left, two research approaches support the idea, and PolitiFactapos;s most glaring mistakes tend to unfairly harm Republicans or aid Democrats.  Conservative Democrat will need to either refute each prong of the argument or instead provide affirmative evidence of either PolitiFactapos;s neutrality or its conservative bias, otherwise it is more reasonable to accept that PolitiFact has a liberal bias.

They give False to statements that are just wrong, but not ridiculous. They give Pants on Fire to claims that are ridiculous and wrong. For example; False claim: I am leading over my opponent in Poll A - But you were not leading; Pants on Fire: I am leading in every poll - But your opponent actually is beating you in many polls. http://www.politifact.com...  quot;The 2012 study showed the apparently subjective quot;Pants on Firequot; rating was 74 percent more likely to fall on a Republican false statement than a Democrat false statement, covering the years from 2007 through 2011.

Republicans are generally more religious then liberals, so many donapos;t believe in evolution. Many also donapos;t believe in Global Warming. PoliticFact believes those things are true, so they rate those claims accordingly. Another thing to consider, there are more Republicans then Democrats in congress, so more Republicans will get fact checked, so more of them will make quot;Pants on Firequot; statements. Republicans probably make more bogus claims, so they will get fact checked more.  quot;The same research approach was applied to other PolitiFact franchises, including its state and quot;PunditFactquot; franchises.

It also says that of these 14 claims, 2 were ambiguous, and 3 were correct. So we are down to 9 miscalculations. And of those, 3 helped republicans. If this site was liberally biased, why even allow the republicans any bonuses? Plus, we donapos;t get any links to the miscalcuations, probably because PoliticFact fixed their errors, like any site would. Next, PolitiFact has done at least 1000 fact checks. There were 6 calculation errors (apparently) that helped Democrats. This means they have a .9% chance of making an error in favor of a Democrat. That doesnapos;t seem biased at all. Also, your source is quot;PolitiFactBias.quot; That doesnapos;t seem like an unbiased source.  quot;It is important to note that we have no scientifically supported baseline for which political party makes more false claims. So when PolitiFact rates Republicans more harshly than Democrats, it supports no reasonable prediction about PolitiFactapos;s ratings matching a known tendency. On the other hand, knowing that journalists lean left makes it reasonable to predict that if that bias affects PolitiFactapos;s ratings then it may result in harsher ratings for Republicans. The harsh ratings for Republicans support a prediction associated with the hypothesis that PolitiFact has a liberal bias.quot; -Look at the democratic chart on this website. That hardly looks like they are helping democrats much. Just under 1/2 of the democratic claims are 1/2 false, mostly false, false, and pants on fire. The republican circle is much more to the negative, but as the source points out, there are many Republicans that make ridiculous claims, and those people are quite popular, so they will get fact checked. http://www.thewire.com...  A) You didnapos;t show how this is a liberal bias. B) You are focusing on an unrelated part of this fact check. Anyway, their point is that this legislation wonapos;t cost as much as the Republicans were saying. C) This is out of context. Read the fact check.

D) Again, what does this mean? You didnapos;t explain how this proves a liberal bias.  So of these 4, you failed to back up 2 of them, one of these quot;biasesquot; is out of context, and the other one is nitpicking.  So I believe I have rebutted your arguments.

    <t>Iapos;m too lazy to write rules.  I have seen this multiple times; the website Politifact haas liberal bias. Evidence? They rate more claims by conservatives false then they do liberals. To me, this doesnapos;t show any bias. It just shows more conservatives say false or ludicrous things. For example, Donald Trump is often fact checked, which will obviously increase the amount of false conservative claims. For example, Donald Trump believes climate change is a Chinese hoax. Liberals just donapos;t say things like that on the same frequency as conservatives. Also, since our political spectrum is so far to the right, we donapos;t see many insane far-left claims, because that position isnapos;t represented in the media or by politicians. And since our spectrum is on the right, more conservatives will make claims then liberals, so more conservatives will get fact checked, as they have more claims. I believe I have madey point. Good luck to whoever accepts this short debate.</t>

    <t>Environmental law has developed in response to emerging awareness and concern over issues impacting the globe. quot;Beginning in the 1970s, Congress enacted a set of laws to protect the nationapos;s air, water and lands from uncontrolled pollution. These laws responded to the consequences of unregulated industrial development that had fouled those resources to the point where rivers were not fishable, air was unhealthy to breathe, and land contamination put Love Canal at the forefront of national consciousness. Over time, environmental regulation has been very successful at reducing the amount of pollution Americans face every dayquot; [1].  The Clean Air Act is the principle law addressing air pollution including carbon dioxide emissions. quot;In 2002, a report by the Journal of American Medical Association credited the actapos;s automobile emission regulations with reducing carbon monoxide related deaths, saving 11,700 lives between 1968 and 1998quot; [2]. Similarly, the Montreal Protocol Act could be preventing 11 billion tons of CO2 from entering Earthapos;s atmosphere [3]. These laws have made it easier for people to breathe and are crucial to our well being.  President Nixon signed the Clean Water Act in 1972, the primary federal law addressing water quality standards for the nationapos;s waterways. Most importantly, this act puts the onus on states to develop plans to protect their watersheds from non-point pollution [2]. Still, a 2009 study by Duke University concluded that while water quality has improved, quot;population growth, limited jurisdiction, and unforeseen water stressors, such as emerging contaminants and climate changequot; nevertheless plague our waters. This means regulation and enforcement of those regulations is still very relevant to our health and the well-being of our planet.  We know that there is a great deal of stress on our environment that puts the livelihood of both animals and humans in danger. Yet people still tend to behave selfishly or in their own (financial) self-interest. quot;The tragedy of the commons is an economic theory of a situation within a shared-resource system where individual users acting independently according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting that resource through their collective actionquot; [4].  To prevent people from ruining the environment for their personal gain, prosecuting environmental crimes has become routine to serve as a deterrent. Pro would have to explain how education alone serves as a useful deterrent.  [1] https://www.justice.gov... [2] http://abcnews.go.com... [3] http://motherboard.vice.com...

    <t>Seeing as this is the final round, I will refute and then end with closing arguments.1) quot;First off: quot;according to my sources Arctic ice had increased from 2010, which is contrary to the expectations of global warming experts.quot;Sorry, was a typing error, I meant it increased from 2012. The link is http://www.conserve-energy-future.com......As Iapos;ve shown before, the author of the article doesnapos;t give any sort of conclusion. He gives 5 reasons why itapos;s true, and 5 reasons why itapos;s not. Not only that, but for his quot;50% more arctic icequot; point, he doesnapos;t give us any sources! This is ElmerB all over again!2) The global sea levels rose about 6.7 inches in the last century. The source is http://www.conserve-energy-future.com...... and if the rate of rising sea level remains same, it wonapos;t be having much effect. Also, it may promote development of underwater cities as they would have to do it for survival.But thatapos;s the problem, the sea levels are rising faster than they used to be! Instead of 6.7 inches in a year, the article Iapos;ve linked indicates it will rise far more than 6.7 inches (1). Con also states, quot;It may promote development of underwater cities as they would have to do it for survival.quot; I thought we were going to try and solve global warming, not run away from it.3) We must find a viable replacement of fossil fuels rather than targeting the removal of co2. If production of co2 continues at this level, what will be the use of reducing it through plants and stuff when we can directly attack the source? It is just like instead of plugging a leak in a ship, we take a bucket and keep throwing the water away. First we must tackle the leak, then we can clean up the ship.I have an analogy for you. Letapos;s say your sink is leaky. You find where it is leaking, and you see a hole in a pipe. Instead of just ordering a replacement part, you need to find a way deal with the leak before the replacement part arrives! Analogies aside, who says we canapos;t do both? Iapos;ve already stated my plan (fertilizing the sea in order to create algal blooms). The U.S. Government is working on converting algae into a bio fuel with success (2). In other words, we can solve the global warming problem, and then harvest the algae once the pollutants are absorbed out of the atmosphere. 4) Yes, but the point I want to make is that fossil fuels are a finite resource and must be saved for later generations, or we will run out of it sooner or later. The predictions may or may not be accurate, but we all know that production of fossil fuel is not possible. We have to drill under the Earth to find their reserves. If there is a way to make sure energy production continues, we must take more concrete steps towards finding new sources of energy.We are (see above). But these steps are not economically or environmentally feasible yet, and the CO2 we produce is still an issue (3). Also, why do you think we should quot;save some fossil fuels for later generations?quot; I thought you wanted to develop different alternatives to fossil fuels altogether.5) quot;Iapos;ve already shown how global warming is a reality, and you accept thatquot;Just for this debate. Otherwise it will become a separate debate, and we will divert from the crux of the debate.Strange, because in every round thus far (including this one), you have linked quot;evidence for why global warming isnapos;t true.quot; I donapos;t think youapos;re telling the truth to the judges here. Examples:quot;Has co2 really increased that much, or is there another reason? And are the readings of 1900apos;s even correct? Weather science is still flawed and developments are still occurring, how can we rely that readings of previous unadvanced centuries were correct and that this century is really colder than before? Diversion (Round 3, Con)-quot;quot;Also, some of these links believe global warming may not be true (Round 1, Con)-quot;quot;Some more links (or people) that are against global warming (Round 2, Con)-quot;quot;according to my sources Arctic ice had increased from 2010, which is contrary to the expectations of global warming experts (Round 2, Con).quot;5) That being said, 7 billion humans breathe out carbon-dioxide everyday. Should we start killing people? No.6) But instead if we tackle the source, naturally even with the number of plants we have right now co2 will be gradually reduced and temperatures would recede to normal. quot;Normal.quot; What temperature is normal? 7) Has co2 really increased that much, or is there another reason? And are the readings of 1900apos;s even correct? Weather science is still flawed and developments are still occurring, how can we rely that readings of previous unadvanced centuries were correct and that this century is really colder than before? Diversion-Fallacious argument. quot;There is no way to prove that the sources are correct, and therefore, global warming isnapos;t true.quot; Fallacy of ignorance (they havenapos;t dis/proven it, so it must be true/false).8) Fossil fuels have not been used properly until the industrial revolution, when machines required power that was generated from fossil fuels, and drills were made that could find new reservoirs of oil. quot;Until Mad Max becomes a reality, no one will be killing each other over a gallon of gasoline or a watt of electricity.quot; Yet we know the unrest in the Middle East is because nations want to take control of the oil reservoirs. It is also because some Arabic countries believe Israel isnapos;t entitled to the land they were given by the UN. It is also because of terrorist activity. It is also because of bad rulers, dictators. The article Iapos;ve linked at the bottom talks about how it is not only oil that causes unrest in the Middle East (4).9) Worse still, fossil fuels canapos;t be synthetically produced in lab, at least without wasting more resources than it is worth. Say if there was a way to utilize the energy of fossil fuel without burning it and causing pollution, how valuable and eco-friendly would fossil fuels become? And if a new energy source that would be renewable and cost efficient was invented, wouldnapos;t people remark burning stuff for energy as archaic? We already have a solution to decrease co2, we must at the very least find a solution to meet the energy demands, should we not?See in my round 2 argument on algal blooms and how they a) solve the global warming problem, and b) can be converted into energy once carbon dioxide levels subside.Now, closing.Global warming is too big of a problem to ignore.We pollute this world. My opponent agrees. However, we disagree on how to solve it. Con would like you to believe that focusing on fossil fuels is all one has to do in order to combat global warming. This is far from the truth. We must first combat the emission, and then the source. We, the human race, are responsible for two million deaths a year due to our carelessness when it comes to air pollution (5). Thatapos;s not even counting land and water pollution! We must combat the emissions, as they are simply to dangerous to let quot;gradually reduce,quot; as is Conapos;s plan. Instead, we must focus on absorbing these pollutants out of the atmosphere by encouraging growth of certain plants. See my Round 2 argument on algae being both a solution for global warming and a way to make clean energy for more information. Iapos;m running out of word count.Thank you for this debate.

    <h>global warming (pro) vs fuel crisis (con) which is more important?</h>

    <t>1) Yes, the fuel shortage wonapos;t kill lives, but it would make survival difficult, as energy production would be severely affected. However, currently global warming isnapos;t killing anyone as such, yes the Polar bears are losing some habitat, but according to my sources Arctic ice had increased from 2010, which is contrary to the expectations of global warming experts. For the temperature to be above the limit for our survival would take a lot more time than for fuel sources to be drained.First off: quot;according to my sources Artic ice had increased from 2010, which is contrary to the expectiations of global warming experts.quot; What sources? Who wrote them? Are they up to date? Second, quot;For the temperature to be above the limit for our survival would take a lot more time than for fuel sources to be drained.quot; Actually, itapos;s not the temperature, itapos;s the water! According to the National Wildlife Federation, quot;New science published after the IPCC report has shown how global warming is happening faster than anticipated (1).quot; I recomend you read the article Iapos;ll link to this argument.2) We must work on devising alternative clean and efficient sources of energy rather than JUST planting trees.quot;You have agreed to this point.Not exacly. If you look through my Round 1 argument, I say I agree with you when it comes to quot;JUST planting trees.quot; I then go on to state that trees are not the primary factor when it comes to cleaning up the enivironment. In other words, this statement you made is grossly overversimplfiying the problem that global warming is. Seeing as you may have been confused with my argument in round 1, Iapos;ll state it now: I dissagree with this point.3) Moreover, dealing with the fuel crisis will reduce global warming as well as vehicles cause pollutionYou say vehicles cause 34.9 percent of co2 emissions. What do factories and businesses use? Fuel, or in short electricity. Electricity production happens through clean sources like dams, solar panels and stuff, but also through nuclear reactors and generators. Generators take fuel. That adds up as well. Plus, does gasoline count as a fuel source? If it does, then its burning and production also cause pollution. Dealing with the fuel crisis will definitely impact global warming.And how is that electricity generated, Con? Thereapos;s a scientific formula, in case you are unaware: Motion + Magnetism = Electricity. The most common way to get that motion is by using fossil fuels. Not hydropower, not solar panels, but fossil fuels. Annother limited resource. According to the EIA, renewables (Neuclear, hydropower, and other renewables) produce 1/3 of all electric power in the US (2). We are already formulating clean energy sources, as you would call them, and yet global warming is still occuring!4) Also, some of these links believe global warming may not be true.....Your final site redirects me to an article written by the one and only expert on the subject: Elmer B. I recommend you read this article in itapos;s full extentI read the article, it gives ten reasons why climate change is a hoax.Iapos;m glad you read your own article, but what Iapos;m attacking is ElmerBapos;s credibility as an expert on the subject of global warming. Using his article as proof is like finding annother debate on DDO and using their argument. Heapos;s a lay witness to the effects of global warming, and his quot;findingsquot; should not be treated as evidence.5) The facts on this site are mostly predictions about the future effects of global warming, and data from the previous century that could have been moulded due to outliers, such as location and the weather cycle.The facts on your site are also predictions about the future effects of a fuel shortage. Have you read your article? You even say it yourself, quot;Hereapos;s a link that shows the predicted rate of fossil fuel depletion.quot; You even add that it is not accurate! Your link:https://www.ecotricity.co.uk......In other words, your arguments have an equal amount of proofs against them. And since you are offering a counterplan, BoP is shared between Pro and Con. Iapos;ve already shown how global warming is a reality, and you accept that. quot;If it does, then its burning and production also cause pollution. Dealing with the fuel crisis will definitely impact global warming (Round 2, Con).quot; You agree to global warming being a problem caused by our pollution. My plan is to encourage growth of plant life to counteract the effects of CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide. Specificaly, to fertilize the ocean to encourage growth of algae in the ocean. Lead Researcher Prof. Rob Raiswell of Leeds University, part of a research team devoted to combating global warming through algae, states, quot;The team will seek to create a massive algae bloom by releasing several tons of iron sulphate into the sea off the coast of the British island of South Georgia. The patch will apparently be large enough to be visible from space (3).quot; The article also states that quot;If successful, the technique could be rolled out across vast swathes of the Great Southern Ocean. Scientists calculate that if the whole 20 million square miles was treated, it could remove up to three and a half Gigatons of C02, equivalent to one eighth of all global annual emissions from fossil fuels (3).quot; Out of all the possible ways to combat global warming, this seems to be the one that holds up. I await Conapos;s rebuttal.David_Debates(1) https://www.nwf.org...(2) https://www.eia.gov...(3) http://www.dailymail.co.uk...</t>

We already have a solution to decrease co2, we must at the very least find a solution to meet the energy demands, should we not? Good luck to pro, was a fun debate, this one.</t>

    <t>Seeing as you took the liberty to post an argument in round 1, I will as well. Beginning with definitions:Fuel crisis: a great bottleneck (or price rise) in the supply of energy resources to an economy.Global warming: a gradual increase in the overall temperature of the earthapos;s atmosphere generally attributed to the greenhouse effect caused by increased levels of carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and other pollutants.Now, Iapos;ll refute your arguments.1) Currently, it would take more time for global warming to become extremely lethal than it would be for the fuel crisis.The fuel crisis will also take a long time to become extremely lethal. I donapos;t see a lot of death when it comes to the fuel crisis. As defined above, this means if there is less supply, and the same demand, prices will rise. Until Mad Max becomes a reality, no one will be killing each other over a gallon of gasoline or a watt of electricity.2) We must work on devising alternative clean and efficient sources of energy rather than JUST planting trees. I agree. We shouldnapos;t be focused on quot;JUST planting trees.quot; Global warming is a way bigger problem than can be solved by planting a few saplings. According to Scientific American, quot;...A new study, however, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reports that forestsapos; other climatic effects can cancel out their carbon cleaning advantage in some parts of the world. Using a three-dimensional climate model, the research team mimicked full global deforestation and also studied the effects of clear-cutting in different regions of latitude, such as the tropics and boreal zones. Apparently, these natural carbon sinks only do their job effectively in tropical regions; in other areas, they have either no impact or actually contribute to warming the planet. In fact, according to this model, by the year 2100, if all the forests were cut and left to rot, the annual global mean temperature would decrease by more than 0.5 degree Fahrenheit (1).quot; Trees are not the primary factor when it comes to decreasing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. I could get more into this, but Iapos;ll move onto your third point.3) Moreover, dealing with the fuel crisis will reduce global warming as well as vehicles cause pollution.Or will it? Studies done by the EIA (Energy Immision Administration) indicate that cars create approximately 29% of CO2 emissions (2). The rest? Factories, businesses, and other modes of transportation. Vehicles altogether count for only 34.9% of man-made CO2 emmisions (2). Attacking the fuel crisis alone would be to ignore 65.1% of other man-made scorces of CO2!4) Also, some of these links believe global warming may not be true-http://www.conserve-energy-future.com......http://www.friendsofscience.org......http://www.globalclimatescam.com......First off, links donapos;t believe anything.

However, currently global warming isnapos;t killing anyone as such, yes the Polar bears are losing some habitat, but according to my sources Arctic ice had increased from 2010, which is contrary to the expectations of global warming experts.

What do factories and businesses use? Fuel, or in short electricity. Electricity production happens through clean sources like dams, solar panels and stuff, but also through nuclear reactors and generators. Generators take fuel. That adds up as well. Plus, does gasoline count as a fuel source? If it does, then its burning and production also cause pollution. Dealing with the fuel crisis will definitely impact global warming. 4) Also, some of these links believe global warming may not be true.....Your final site redirects me to an article written by the one and only expert on the subject: Elmer B. I recommend you read this article in itapos;s full extentquot; I read the article, it gives ten reasons why climate change is a hoax.  Your link -http://www.conserve-energy-future.com... It says that temperature rose by 0.8 celsius in the past century. It doesnapos;t say which two years are being compared. And even if it is true, just see how much time global warming has before it affects us severely. Temperature increase in different localities are different as well. The facts on this site are mostly predictions about the future effects of global warming, and data from the previous century that could have been moulded due to outliers, such as location and the weather cycle. Some more links (or people) that are against global warming- http://www.globalresearch.ca... http://www.techtimes.com... http://townhall.com...  Anyways, I would say that there is no concrete measurement of the intensity of global warming. Our weather prediction is bad enough as it is, what makes the people believe in global warming all of a sudden? Global warming has been overhyped due to media attention and the media should give more focus to the fuel shortage.  https://www.ecotricity.co.uk... Hereapos;s a link that shows the predicted rate of fossil fuel depletion. Yes, it may not be accurate, but the fact that fossil fuels take millions of years to form is accepted everywhere, and that once we are out of fuel, we may have no way of getting it back anytime sooner. Worse still, there are oil deposits in the Arctic, and if extraction takes place, it will have a negative effect on global warming. But if the fuel crisis is dealt with, there will be no need to melt the ice. Rather than looking at solving global warming before the fuel problem, we must solve the fuel shortage before global warming. Just look at the time spans. Fuel would run out roughly in a 100 years, global warming would only increase 2 celsius average in a 100 years, if the emissions double from the present.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank beforeifall for accepting this debate.CO2apos;s Effect on TemperatureFirst, correlation. The climate data over the last 700,000 years or so show that temperature and CO2 track very close to each other. quot;...there is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2. The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv. The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr.quot;[1]This graph shows the CO2-temperature correlation over the last 650,000 years[2]: CO2 can be the dominant forcing for the climate. Consider the Cenozoic era (the last 65 million years). Overall, solar activity increased 0.4% over this period. quot;Because Earth absorbs about 240 W/m^2 of solar energy, that brightness increase is a forcing of about 1 W/m^2. This small linear increase of forcing, by itself, would have caused a modest global warming through the Cenozoic Era.quot; The CO2 levels caused a much higher forcing. quot;In contrast, atmospheric CO2 during the Cenozoic changed from at least 1000 ppm in the early Cenozoic to as small as 170 ppm during recent ice ages. The resulting climate forcing, as can be computed accurately for this CO2 range... exceeds 10 W/m^2. It is clear that CO2 was the dominant climate forcing in the Cenozoic.quot;[3]But then, thereapos;s also the matter of causation. CO2apos;s effect on temperature can be explained by appealing to the carbon cycle. The Earth receives all of its energy from the sun. Some of this is reflected by the Earthapos;s surface and by clouds and other particles present in the atmosphere. In addition, some of the built up energy in the Earthapos;s surface can be emitted back into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases like CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide trap some of this emitted heat by reflecting the radiation back to the surface. However, greater concentrations of greenhouse gases cause more of the energy that is being emitted from the surface to be reflected back to the surface. This causes more heat to build up, warming the planet.[4]Now consider climate sensitivity. Climate sensitivity is the amount the temperature would rise if the CO2 concentration were doubled. Obviously, if thereapos;s a large climate sensitivity, then increases in CO2 have large effect. It is known that the climate sensitivity is around 1 degree C. However, this can be amplified through feedbacks. Positive ones amplify the sensitivity, while negative ones diminish the sensitivity. The evidence overwhelmingly comes down on the former, that positive feedbacks are happening. Increases in CO2 cause temperature increases, which are amplified by water vapor and the effect on clouds.quot;Since the radiative effects associated with the buildup of water vapor to near-saturation levels and the subsequent condensation into clouds are far stronger than the equilibrium level of radiative forcing by the non-condensing GHGs, this results in large local fluctuations in temperature about the global equilibrium value.quot;[5]This can be shown in the below graph[5]: Now back to the carbon cycle. Global warming can result in the death of vegetation (due to droughts) and the warming of the ocean. Both of these further reduce the maximum absorption of the Earths carbon cycle, thus resulting in even more CO2 being released into the atmosphere. And with this, CO2 increases even more. In other words, CO2-caused temperature increases are amplified by positive feedbacks and the mechanics of the carbon cycle.So, the positive feedback amplifies the climate sensitivity. How much it is amplified can be determined through study. Using a Bayesian statistical approach, which is “the dominant [method] in the literature”, these findings support the notion of climate sensitivity as maximum 4 degrees C, a mean of 3 degrees C, and likely not lower than 3 degrees.[6]The graph below gives a statistical analysis[7]:The mean is around 3 degrees C. The CO2 that humans emit thus has an effect of 3 degrees C per doubling of CO2. This can be shown by the fact that CO2 concentrations have increased from around 275 ppm to around 400 ppm. This is an increase of around 40%. This should manifest itself with a temperature increase of a little less than 1.5 degrees C. Indeed, temperatures have increased around this amount over the last 150 years. The anthropogenic-forcing climate models thus match observations.[8]In other words, in addition to the direct evidence of how the Earth is warming, the climate models based on a greenhouse gas cause to global warming explain almost perfectly the recent global warming. This is a lot of evidence for a human case to the recent global warming.Humansapos; Emission of CO2It would be rather coincidental if the recent rise in global warming happened to start just around the time that humans started to emit large quantities of greenhouse gases. However, there is direct evidence as well, in addition to the already established correlation between temperature and CO2.Now, it is known that CO2 levels are increasing. quot;In pre-industrial times over the last 10,000 years, CO2 was relatively stable at around 275 to 285 parts per million. Over the last 250 years, atmospheric CO2 levels have increased by about 100 parts per million.quot; CO2 levels are increasing at a level not seen in at least 500,000 years, if not longer.[9]Here is a graph showing CO2 concentrations over the last 10000 years[10][11]:The evidence that this excess CO2 is the cause of the recent global warming is voluminous. One of the biggest indicators is the fact that less heat is escaping into space. Satellites measure less heat escaping out into space, particularly at the specific wavelengths that CO2 absorbs. In other words, the Earth is retaining a greater percentage of the heat that it receives from the sun than it did before. This excess heat manifests itself through global temperature increases. quot;If less heat is escaping to space, where is it going? Back to the Earthapos;s surface. Surface measurements confirm this, observing more downward infrared radiation. A closer look at the downward radiation finds more heat returning at CO2 wavelengths, leading to the conclusion that apos;...this experimental data should effectively end the argument by skeptics that no experimental evidence exists for the connection between greenhouse gas increases in the atmosphere and global warming.apos;quot;[12][13][14]Another piece of evidence is a comparison of warming in the troposphere and stratosphere. Because the CO2 is in the upper troposphere, the troposphere temperature would increase, while the stratospheric temperature would decrease, because there would be less heat reaching the stratosphere. quot;Computer model estimates of the ‘human influence’ fingerprint are broadly similar to the observed pattern. In sharp contrast, model simulations of internal and total natural variability cannot produce the same sustained, large-scale warming of the troposphere and cooling of the stratosphere.quot;[12][15][16]This graph shows this[15]:Related to this is the fact that the tropopause, the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere, is rising. This is because the temperature gradient between the top of the troposphere and the bottom of the stratosphere is greater, as just described above. This causes the warmer air from the troposphere to rise, pushing the troposphere up. quot;Observations indicate that the height of the tropopause - the boundary between the stratosphere and troposphere - has increased by several hundred meters since 1979.quot;[12][17]Another related piece of evidence to this is the cooling of the ionosphere. The ionosphere is the layer of the Earthapos;s atmosphere where ionization takes place. It comprises the upper mesosphere, thermosphere, and lower exosphere. More precisely, it extends from 60 km to 1000 km above the surface. Studies indicate, quot;...moderate negative trends of about 2 to 3 K per decade at heights of 50 to 70 km... slightly larger cooling trends at heights of 70 to 80 km in the low and middle latitudes... essentially zero temperature trends between 80 and 100 km... at heights near 350 km, a negative trend of about –17 K per decade.quot;[12][18]Yet another piece of evidence is the frequency of cold days and nights. Because the sun only shines in the day time, if the sun was causing global warming, the days would warm faster than the nights, while if greenhouse gases were causing global warming, this wouldnapos;t be observed. It is the latterapos;s prediction that is observed. quot;What we observe is a decrease in cold nights greater than the decrease in cold days, and an increase in warm nights greater than the increase in warm days.quot;[12][15][19]This can be shown in the below graph[15]:Overall, the evidence shows that human-emitted greenhouse gases are the main cause of global warming. CO2, in addition to other greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide are being emitted by humans in very large amounts, and this is manifesting itself in an increase in the average global temperature.ConclusionGreenhouse gases cause global warming because of their heat trapping abilities. Humans have been emitting vast amounts of greenhouse gases over the last 150 years, and this shows itself on the CO2 measurements. The atmospheric warming pattern and greater heating at night are evidence that the recent global warming is caused by those human emitted greenhouse gases. These increases are amplified through the water vapor and cloud positive feedbacks and the positive feedback that arises through the climate cycle. The climate sensitivity ends up being around 3 degrees C. Finally, the CO2-temperature record shows that the two correlate with remarkable correlation.SourcesSources in comments.</t>

    <t>Numerous alternate causes to global warming prove that humans are not the primary source. Adopt a mindset of innocent until proven guilty, the affirmative must prove beyond correlation and doubt that human cause warming. The Pro must win that mankind is the quot;principal [and] leadingquot; meaning that if I win that there is an alternative cause that is more responsible for warming than humans, or at least humans are not a major cause, then I win the debate. (First Pro speech)As the Con, I may contradict myself as my sole purpose is to disprove the Proapos;s statement. The Pro must remain consistent to prove their position.First, 1,500 year climate cycles. Fred Singer, an atmospheric and space physicist with a PhD from Princeton who founded the the Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) and Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC), and Dennis Avery, a agricultural analyst who was awarded the National Intelligence Medal of Achievement, agree that there is substantial evidence around the world that climate cycles easily explain the warming we currently see. There is already a scientific consensus that cooling cycles (Ice Ages) exist, so it already not unreasonable to assume that warming cycles also exist. From 1300 to 1850, the Little Ice Age caused the earth to be about 2.5 degrees Celsius cooler than average. The Modern Warming portion of the cycle began in 1850, and quot;warming will continue for some time in the future, perhaps 200 years or more, regardless of human activity.quot; Thus, todayapos;s warming can be explained by these climate cycles. These scientists gathered data from North America to Asia, and they use the ice caps in Greenland to further prove that by the way the ice formed, there must have been 1,500 year warming cycles. Sea sediment core in Ireland also shows the 1,500 year cycle. Fossilized pollen, boreholes, tree rings, and mountain tree lines all provide evidence to this theory because scientists can find how they were created or observe differing distances of tree rings to find the amount of warming that these objects underwent while being created. Itapos;s important to realize that completely dismissing 1,500 year cycles dismisses quot;human histories from the past 2,000 years...and a variety of physical evidence found by a huge body of serious researchers.quot; (1) The Vostok ice sample that the rise and fall of CO2 correlate with natural cycles. Temperatures correlate with Ice Age minimus and maximus. There is a 420,000 thousand year cycle of carbon emissions. Given that humans release very little of the total carbon ouput, the correlation is between the carbon cycle and temperature cycle. (5)Secondly, human emissions of carbon dioxide are specifically not to blame. Patrick Moore, a former member of Greenpeace and an ecologist said the following while testifying in front of Congress: quot;There is no scientific proof that human emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) are the dominant cause of the minor warming of the Earthapos;s atmosphere over the past 100 years.quot; In fact, carbon dioxide levels were 10x higher during the Ice Ages than they are now. This was also true 500 million years ago before evolution had created humans. Not only does this empiric disprove that humans are a major cause of increased carbon dioxide, but it also disproves that CO2 causing warming. Regardless of the theoretical examples the Pro provides, empirics trump. Third, the industrial revolution began in 1750, yet only from 1910 to 1940, there was an increase in .5 degrees Celsius of the global temperature. There was more than enough time for factories to produce enough carbon dioxide to have resulted in warming before those 200 years. This delay in increase prove that humans are not the main cause and is evidence of the climate cycles. (2) During this time, temperatures were much higher than today, but CO2 levels were lower. This places doubt in the significance of anthropogenic CO2 release. (7)Fourth, the climate rapidly changes to different stimuli. Anthony Lupo, assistant professor of atmospheric science at the University of Missouri at Columbia and an expert reviewer for the UNapos;s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Chang, discusses the fact that regional climates tend to experience much more change than globally. However, climates change rapidly, so if human emissions of CO2 really are responsible for warming, then 1) there should already be a much larger change in global temperature given the huge increase of CO2 emissions and 2) even when there were smaller amounts of CO2, this should have been enough to trigger an environmental change (3).Fifth, climate models fail. There was an increase in global temperature of 0.57C during the 30-year period from 1970 to 2000. Since then there has been no increase, perhaps a slight decrease, in average global temperature. This clearly disproves the numerous computer models that the Pro cites as CO2 had increased after 2000 (2). Many believe that there will be an increase of anywhere from 2-11 degrees Fahrenheit due to info from computer models. Misinterpretation of results and models lacking the complexities of the fundamental global processes mean that these cannot be trusted. Consistently, politicians like Al Gore have predicted that the world would have literally ended by now. Prefer direct facts and empirical examples rather than theoretical results of greenhouse gases. Thus, do not automatically trust that greenhouse gases cause warming without direct evidence from changes in temperature â€quot; the facts donapos;t support this conclusion. (3) Though the Earth is warming, itapos;s cooler than expected. There should have already been a two degree Celsius increase 100,000 years ago. (5) [Insert pie graph from this source]Sixth, fossil fuels do not cause an increase in CO2 levels according to the most accurate NASA data. From 1940 to 1950, CO2 levels flatlined. The only change was roughly .8 ppm downwards. World War II caused a massive increase in fossil fuel levels, yet this did not change CO2 levels. Prefer empirics. (4) Also, the Vostok ice core sample proves. CO2 increases did not increase temperature for 800 years. This sample also explains why a fall in temperature and a fall in CO2 correlate — cold water can hold more CO2 than warm water. Even more, temperature falls around 800-1,000 years before CO2 levels rise or fall giving water time to absorb the CO2. (5)Seventh, even if humans do increase CO2 levels, theyapos;re only responsible for a 3% increase. Even that released CO2 is not all directly released into the atmosphere given that the oceans absorb so much of it. Limestone, chalk, and other rocks have 100x as much CO2 as the atmosphere. This 3% is responsible for .27% of the greenhouse effect. quot;If we were to cease all transport and industry right now, it is very unrealistic to assume that it would have any impact on global warming.quot; (5) Eighth, solar radiation is the single largest cause of warming. NASA repeatedly releases articles explaining the importance of the sun and sun cycles on the Earth. The near infrared and visible light waves are absorbed by the lower atmosphere, the oceans, and the land. Thus, these areas heat resulting in a higher global average temperature. Even more, absorption of UV rays heats the stratosphere. Thereapos;s a general scientific consensus that this increases temperatures in the troposphere. Additionally, sun spots serve to reduce or increase warming. These can sway warming either way considering that these are 11 year cycles. This can explain why times of higher CO2 did not increase temperature. Scientists believe that the sun is responsible for at least half of all the climate change seen in the past 110 years. Even the IPCC, an organization devoted to creating response to globa warming, agrees. (6)The 100,000 year cycle of radiation resulting from the elliptical orbit of the Earth is at a peak and will be for the next several thousand years. This radiation is consistent with spikes in CO2 methane. The melting of ice caps has happened with each of these cycles. The huge volume of these gases is too high to be anthropogenic but is consistent with previous cycles. Mars is also increasing in temperature due to the recent increase in solar radiation. Dr. H. Abdussamatov, head of the  St. Petersburg Pulkova Astronomical Observatory, believes that the Earth has hit a temperature ceiling and will enter a cooling period despite fossil fuel use. This explanation accounts for the lack of increased greenhouse gas emissions since 1988. (7) [Insert Figure III]ConclusionSolar radiation, solar cycles, and multiple terrestrial temperature cycles are greater and more probable causes of warming. Humans produce very little emissions given the oceansapos; absorption and solar radiation cycles. The Earth has consistently changed temperatures before humans populated the planet. Even more, multiple empirics and evidence from around the world disprove the importance of humans on warming. 3% is a ridiculously small number when compared to multiple other emittors. CO2 levels were higher in the Ice Age when the Earth was substantially cooler. By placing some amount of doubt in the significance of mankindapos;s importance on warming while promoting several other causes, humans are at least not the main factor of warming.(1) http://www.ncpa.org...(2) http://www.dailymail.co.uk...(3) http://www.napsnet.com...(4)http://www.americanthinker.com...(5) http://www.collective-evolution.com...(6) http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov...(7) http://www.americanthinker.com...**Iapos;m going to advertise my surveillance debate here: comment on that page if interested! :)</t>

    <t>I would like to thank beforeifall for presenting his argument. 1500-Year CyclesThe 1500-year cycles are not global. Most of the data that scientists have found on this has come from the northern hemisphere. However, in the southern hemisphere, the exact opposite trend happens. In other words, whenever the northern hemisphere is warming, the southern hemisphere is cooling, and vice versa. quot;Whereas Antarctic and Greenland climate records do exhibit approximate anti-phase behavior around 50% of the time, they are generally in phase during cooling. A phase lead of Southern Hemisphere climate of 1000-1600 years is statistically indistinguishable from a lag of 400-800 years, whether for Dansgaard-Oeschger [1500-year cycles], Heinrich, or longer-duration events. The quot;seesawquot; or quot;Southern leadquot; appearance of the data arises from the fundamentally different characeristics of the climate series, most importantly the absence of rapid warming events in Antarctica comparable to those in Greenlandquot;.[1]However, in the current case, we see that both the northern and southern hemispheres are warming, meaning that it cannot be due to the 1500-year cycles.[2]Human Emissions of Carbon DioxideThe claim that CO2 levels were higher during certain ice ages is based off of old, faulty data. A recent study found that the levels during the Ordovician era (the era most climate skeptics focus on when making arguments like this) were eight times below pre-Industrial levels. This is indeed still a little high, but itapos;s also important bearing in mind that the sun was dimmer then. During the Ordovician era, the sun was 4% dimmer. This meant that higher CO2 levels would have been necessary for Earth to have not been frozen over. This is based on established nuclear models of main sequence stars. Considering all of this, quot;...over the long term, there is indeed a correlation between CO2 and paleotemperaturequot;.[3][4][5]Apparent Mismatch Between CO2 and Temperature IncreasesIt is true that the vast majority of the warming happened over the 20th century. However, it is also true that the vast majority of the CO2 emitted into the atmosphere was emitted over the 20th century. See the graph below[6]:It is easy to see that only a small fraction of the emitted CO2 was emitted before 1900, and this correlates with the fact that only a small fraction of the temperature increases occurred before 1900.Amount of CO2 EmissionsAny CO2 emitted into the atmosphere would have an adverse effect on the climate. As I said in the last round, there was a study that said, using a Bayesian statistical approach, the climate sensitivity as maximum 4 degrees C, a mean of 3 degrees C, and likely value of not lower than 3 degrees. This means that the CO2 that humans emit thus has an effect of 3 degrees C per doubling of CO2. This can be shown by the fact that CO2 concentrations have increased from around 275 ppm to around 400 ppm. This is an increase of around 40%. This should manifest itself with a temperature increase of a little less than 1.5 degrees C. This is indeed around the amount of global warming we have seen so far. It should not be more than this.[7][8]If less CO2 had been added into the atmosphere, then the planet would have warmed less, but it still would have warmed. This would be true for any non-zero amount of CO2 emission. Climate ModelsThis point is irrelevant. The climate is much more complicated than just a correlation between CO2 and temperature (even though it still exists). Climate models have to be extraordinarily complicated, and even so, they might leave out very important climate forcings. Even if they didnapos;t, there might still be glitches in the models that would make the model give an invalid result. The ability for climate models to accurately predict the climate is completely independent of the whether or not CO2 levels are related to temperature levelsIt is worth falsifying the notion, however, that there has been no warming since 2000. This idea is based on satellite measurements of atmospheric temperature. However, there are two problems with this. One, while the atmosphere accounts for only less than 3% of increased heat content, the oceans account for the vast majority, and they show no such trend.[9] The graph below shows this[10]: And two, there have been a lot of negative short term forcings over the last 20 years. Removing the short term trends of the extremely powerful El Nino in 1998, volcanic activity, and solar activity, the atmospheric temperature plot looks more smooth[11]:(You can faintly see what the plot looked like before the negative forcings were removed; the variability after 1998 makes any analysis before a statistical reanalysis suspect).Correlation Between CO2 Emissions and CO2 LevelsMany studies have shown that the quot;airborne fractionquot;, or the fraction of human CO2 emissions that stay in the atmopshere, is around 43%. The fact that the CO2 levels flatlined during WWII is actually rather complicated. While military activity spiked, other industrial activity plummeted and millions of people died, decreasing the need for non-military CO2 emission even lower. In addition, CO2 levels are not known with the precision necessary to unravel this mystery before 1960, due to improper measuring techniques. There are simply too many factors too consider to make a sound conclusion here.As for the apparent 800-year lag in CO2 levels after temperature increases, this is indeed true. However, this is because there was no non-natural (i.e. human) forcing of CO2. Instead, another forcing initiates the warming trend, and CO2 amplifies it. quot;When the Earth comes out of an ice age, the warming is not initiated by CO2 but by changes in the Earthapos;s orbit. The warming causes the oceans to release CO2. The CO2 amplifies the warming and mixes through the atmosphere, spreading warming throughout the planet. So CO2 causes warming and rising temperature causes CO2 rise. Overall, about 90% of the global warming occurs after the CO2 increase.quot;[12]Human Versus Natural CO2 EmissionNatural CO2 emissions are typically stable, meaning that there is rarely any long term climate change that results from natural emissions of CO2. However, humans have emitted a lot of CO2, above and beyond what is naturally emitted, and this unbalances the climate stability. quot;Although our output of 29 gigatons of CO2 is tiny compared to the 750 gigatons moving through the carbon cycle each year, it adds up because the land and ocean cannot absorb all of the extra CO2. About 40% of this additional CO2 is absorbed. The rest remains in the atmosphere.quot;[13]Solar ActivityThe most important of the natural climate forcings is indeed the sun. It is the source of the Earthapos;s energy. This energy comes from the radiation emitted as a result of fusion reactions at the core of the sun. This radiation is known as the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI). Any change in the TSI causes energy imbalances on the Earth. This energy imbalance can be calculated using the formula below[14]:Delta means change, so Delta(F) means the change in energy (i.e. energy imbalance) and Delta(TSI) means the change in solar irradiance. The 0.7 factor comes from the fact that the Earth reflects about 30% of the solar radiation it receives, and the 1/4 factor comes from spherical geometry.Changes in temperature are proportional to the energy imbalance. This can be expressed in the formula below[14]:Lambda is the constant of proportionality, representing the climate sensitivity (discussed in my first argument) in this case.The only thing thatapos;s left is to actually determine the values. First, the change in TSI (in this case, between 1900 and 1950). quot;...weapos;ll estimate the change in TSI at 0.5 to 2 W-m-2.quot; This corresponds to an energy imbalance of around 0.1-0.35 W-m-2. Next, the lambda factor. I explained in the last article that the statistically most probable value for the climate sensitivity was around 3 degrees C. But, there was a lot of variation. quot;Studies have given a possible range of values of 2 to 4.5°C warming for a doubling of CO2, which corresponds to a range of 0.54 to 1.2°C/(W-m-2) for λ.quot; This gives range of values from 0.05 to 0.4 degrees C, with a most probable value of 0.15 degrees C (corresponding to the statistically most likely climate sensitivity). In other words, solar activity from 1900 to 1950 raised the temperature of the Earth 0.15 degrees C. Looking at the effect of CO2 emissions over that same period, humans increased the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere by about 20 parts per million, giving a range of values of 0.14-0.32 degrees C for the effect of that emission on the climate, with the most probable being 0.22 degrees C.[14][15]This corresponds to CO2 amounting for 60% of the warming from 1900-1950. After that, it gets higher. CO2 emissions rise exponentally, and changes in the TSI start getting less positive, and eventually become negative after 1975. quot;Over the past century, this increase in TSI is responsible for about 15-20% of global warming. But since TSI hasnapos;t increased in at least the past 32 years (and more like 60 years, based on reconstructions), the Sun is not directly responsible for the warming over that period.quot; Solar activity cannot account for the warming after 1975, and even before that was a smaller factor than CO2.[14][15]This can be shown in the image below[16]:Therefore, we see CO2 correlates with recent temperature increases better than solar activity, especially after 1975.Long Term Forcings and MarsThe cycle of radiation is so long that it would not be having the sudden, enormous effect weapos;ve seen over the last 150 years. As for Mars, the studies concluded that it was a change in the surface dust, not solar activity, that caused the warming. Surface dust has a massive effect on Marsapos;s climate. The supposed warming trend went from before the surface dust change to after it. Therefore, Mars did not warm because of solar activity.[17][18]SourcesSources in comments.</t>

    <t>Thank you for the chance to debate this topic. I am an avid believer that climate change is mainly man made, at least now.  Your first point was how even though data shows a correlation between CO2 emissions and temperature, carbon emission is not the largest factor. But according to the World Meteorological Organization (as well as NASA and countless organizations and scientists), CO2 is the largest factor of global warming. This study included natural substances like water vapor. The problem with CO2 is that it is a very abundant greenhouse gas which takes a long time to dissipate from the atmosphere. 65% of global emissions are CO2 emissions, making it by far the most abundant man made greenhouse gas. Even though it isnapos;t as abundant as water vapor, it is much more effective at trapping the Sunapos;s rays. Now, greenhouse gases are the largest cause of global warming, while the most effective and very abundant greenhouse gas is CO2. Here are some graphs:  From NASA, this is probably the most infamous graph as it shows just how drastic CO2 emissions have gone up.  (It wonapos;t let me post photos, so here is the link) http://climate.nasa.gov...  Enlightening, isnapos;t it?  Now this concerns temperature rise at the same time as CO2 rise.  http://climate.nasa.gov...  This link should have the graph close to the top on the right hand side Not only that, but a massive 97% of all scientists agree global warming is man made. ------- Your second point was that temperatures were higher in the past than they are now (specifically, during the time of Roman civilization). While there definitely are natural cycles that rise and lower, Earthapos;s temperature is accelerating at a much faster rate than any natural cycle before, and shows no sign of stopping like a cycle would. This is again, because of man made emissions, and the majority of those are carbon. ------- Your third point was that global warming is mainly due to sun rays hitting the earth and heating it up. While sun rays hit the earth and that is what causes all weather, the amount of rays stays basically stable like the earths orbit. So when greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere, they trap sun rays and warm the earth.  So the evidence shows clearly that global warming is mainly people driven, although natural cycles may contribute to the increase. The evidence shows clearly that greenhouse gases are the largest cause of global warming. The evidence shows clearly that CO2 is the largest greenhouse gas threat. Therefore, the evidence shows that CO2 is the main cause of global warming.  Sources:  https://www3.epa.gov...  http://climate.nasa.gov...  https://www3.epa.gov...  https://www.wmo.int...</t>

    <t>The Macquarie Dictionary defines the term quot;climate changequot; as- a significant change in the usual climatic conditions especially that thought to be caused by global warming. This apos;climate changeapos; can be caused by natural or human induced impacts.  The global average temperature has risen by nearly a degree in the past 50 years. Scientists around the world have been recording temperature increases, raised ocean levels and melting of ice caps. All this is evidence that the earth is experiencing a quot;climate changequot;.  Many people believe that this change is primarily due to the fact that our CO2 emissions have created more greenhouse gases. They believe that there is a relationship between the rise in temperatures and the rise in CO2 emissions.  Data shows an quot;associationquot; between temperature levels and CO2 emissions but does not necessarily prove that increased CO2 levels are the most significant aspect of todayquot;s climate change.  For something complex like the weather system, many scientists are needed to unravel the story behind climate change. While most scientists believe climate change occurs, not all agree on the extent and relevance of human activity as an influence on climate change.  While major international climate agencies all emphasise the critical role of CO2 emissions in climate change, others are not so sure.  For example, some scientists have conducted research that suggests that temperatures were higher than they are today, during the Roman and Medieval periods. These ancient civilisations would not have emitted CO2 emissions as we do today, so why did their temperatures rise?  Temperatures have risen and fallen for a long time. The National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) states that climate change over the longer term is mainly due to the amount of sun energy hitting the Earth. Slight changes in the Earthquot;s orbit and changes in sun ray intensity, can alter the temperatures here on Earth.  Even so, most scientists still emphasise the role of CO2 emissions in unprecedented, rapid global warming. The frank fact is that climate change cannot be stopped. It is completely natural.</t>

    <t>Before I begin I would like to initially reinforce the topic of the debate: CO2 emissions are DIRECTLY responsible for climate change. As the negative, I will rebut the affirmative as to why CO2 emissions (whilst adding to the heat of the planet) are not directly responsible for the changes we are experiencing on our Earth today.  The affirmative stated statistics such as- apos;CO2 is the largest factor of global warmingapos;, apos;97% of scientists agree global warming is man-madeapos;, apos;CO2 is the largest greenhouse gas threatapos;. Whilst these points may be tried and tested, they do not favour the topic when the phrase apos;directly responsibleapos; is included.  From what I gather, the affirmative believes that CO2 is speeding up the process of global warming. Whilst this may be true, in between the lines of this statement we can discover that another factor is actually CAUSING the process of global warming. As the negative, I believe that the cause is the fluctuation of the Earthapos;s orbit (which the affirmative incorrectly stated as apos;stableapos;) and the consistent rise and fall of the planetapos;s historical temperatures.  I stand by the points I raised in the first round and have now refuted the rebuttal put forward by the affirmative and regarded it as invalid. Does the affirmative have anything within itapos;s case to state why my reason for global warming is incorrect? Do they believe that CO2 emissions are the initial cause of the Earth heating world-wide? By now, they should surely agree that CO2 emission are not directly responsible for climate change.</t>

    <t>To conclude my case I would like to point out the obvious flaws in the oppositionapos;s previous case. They stated:  quot;Before I make my points, I would like to address the mistaken Negative. I do know that the topic is quot;CO2 is the largest factor in global warmingquot;, and that is what I am arguing. Iapos;m sorry if that wasnapos;t made clear in my evidence, but if you look back you will find that I certainly did argue that point. Your evidence was arguing against CO2 being the largest factor, and as your opponent that is what I must counter. Now that itapos;s out of the way, letapos;s begin.quot;  Once again I correct the affirmative on the correct wording of the topic. The topic of this debate is that CO2 emissions are directly responsible for climate change. Throughout their entire case the affirmative seems to be referring to their fictional topic of: CO2 is the largest factor in global warming.  The affirmative also stated that my evidence was backing this fictional topic. Whilst this may be true, proving that CO2 emissions are not the largest factor of global warming only adds to the overall proof that they are not directly responsible for the effects.  To clear confusion, the definition of directly responsible is: without anyone or anything intervening. Whilst the affirmative continued to provide arguments proving the existence of CO2 emissions as the largest factor, they did not provide any points stating the absence of an intervention.  There are many examples of other processes in our natural world that are speeding up the global warming. Some of these include methane emissions from cattle, deforestation and chemical fertilisers on crop lands. Although the affirmative believes that CO2 emissions play the largest role in heating the planet, they are not the sole reason behind the issue.  If the impossible event of a CO2 emission cease occurred, the Earth would still be heating up. Slowly but surely, the effects of the Earthapos;s orbit and the causes mentioned above will continue to heat the planet that we live on today.  The affirmative also stated: quot;the effects of the Suns rays on earth are increasing.quot;  In theory, this phrase mentions the effects on sun rays on Earth. Incredulously, even these sun rays play a role in global warming and further diminish the affirmatives picture of CO2 emissions being directly responsible.  In a surprising twist to the debate, the affirmative suddenly seems to understand the topic of the debate towards the end of their case and produces the statement below. Unfortunately, it is also flawed.  quot;CO2 was the initial cause of global warming, and this is shown in hundreds of studies and tests since that show the before and after the industrial revolution. The fact is, today CO2 is the largest factor and the cause, and I have all the sources to support it.quot;  Cold hard evidence against the point brought up by the affirmative can be found in my first argument. Global warming is simply defined as increasing temperatures on our planet. Carbon dating and a myriad of other scientific tests show the heating and cooling of the planet well before the involvement of the Industrial Revolution. If the planet was heating up during Medieval periods, how can the affirmative say that CO2 is the cause of global warming when the people of the past had not even heard of the word carbon?  In finality, I am not denying the fact that global warming exists. I am not denying that CO2 emissions play a considerable role in the heating of our planet. However, I do deny the views of the affirmative in thinking the CO2 emissions play a sole role in global warming. There are many other factors that are also contributing to the heating of our planet.  In further expansion, I deny the politicians and organisational leaders within our world. The planet is heating up and it is effecting ecosystems and environments alike. Whilst we sit here and debate whether CO2 emissions are directly responsible, politicians all over the globe are doing the same. It is time to stop the debate and face the fact that although CO2 emissions have played a big role in global warming, the gradual heating of our planet is totally inevitable.  As an international force we need to combat global warming and thus climate change by investigating new methods of adapting to a changing climate. Cooling down the Earth by reducing CO2 emissions is a false statement because the Earth will continue to heat via its natural cycles which we as humans would be wrong to alter.  As the negative side, I strongly believe that CO2 emissions are not directly responsible for climate change. Thank you.</t>

Iapos;m sorry if that wasnapos;t made clear in my evidence, but if you look back you will find that I certainly did argue that point. Your evidence was arguing against CO2 being the largest factor, and as your opponent that is what I must counter. Now that itapos;s out of the way, letapos;s begin.  Negative thinks I only believe CO2 is speeding up the process of climate change. It most definitely is, and they are not mistaken in that. But not only is it speeding up and forcing climate change to continue, it is the main factor in this.  No matter what my opponent may think, my evidence clearly showed CO2 is the largest threat. Greenhouse gases are proven to be the largest contributor to global warming, and CO2 is the largest greenhouse gas. And according to the World Meteorological Organization, the US Environmental Protection Agency, NASA, the European Commission and thousands of scientists, CO2 is the largest factor.  Negative may say that fluctuations in the earths orbit are the largest cause. To say that fluctuations in earths orbit are the largest cause is a bold statement. I think that by orbit fluctuations, he means that it causes Suns rays to hit the earth more. But according to NASA, solar maxima is only .1 percent higher than solar minima on average.  To further my counter argument, if there had been an increase in solar output, both the stratosphere and troposphere would have warmed up. But instead, patterns show that the stratosphere has actually cooled. Meanwhile, land and the troposphere have been warming, which is no doubt due to greenhouse gases (particularly CO2). This shows that fluctuations in earths orbit, although drastically climate changing when they occur, are not occurring right now.  However, the effects of the Suns rays on earth are increasing. Not because of orbit fluctuation, but because of greenhouse gases that trap the Suns heat.  CO2 is directly responsible for global warming today. In the earlier graph, I showed how carbon emissions have increased drastically since the industrial revolution. I then linked a graph that showed temperature increase over the same time period. The fact is, since the industrial revolution, temperatures have drastically increased at a rate that would never have occurred without coal burning and that whole era. So CO2 emission IS directly responsible for global warming.  The negative, in their conclusion, called my points invalid. I say the exact opposite. I stand by my points, and the facts that went with it. I most surely do not agree that their case is correct. I have just shown why their case is completely wrong. CO2 was the initial cause of global warming, and this is shown in hundreds of studies and tests since that show the before and after the industrial revolution. The fact is, today CO2 is the largest factor and the cause, and I have all the sources to support it.  Sources:  http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov...  And sources I cited earlier.</t>

    <t>Sorry for the overuse of qoutes brevity and late timing. I have an unexpected on demand essay to finish by midnight.1. One of your main arguments against zoo/aquariums is that most are for-profit and basically roadside attractions. I obviously recognize that many of these side zoos/aquariums practice animal cruelty, which is definetley illegal. However, you canapos;t deny an institution that has the ability to conserve, educate and protect animals because others exploit the system. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of zoos/aquariums have properly accredited under organizations such as the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums, the Zoological Association of America,etc, and who serve millions of people, not just towns, childrens birthday parties. Work should be done to encourage improvement, not discourage zoos because their are exploitations.2. It is impossible to measure the certain magnitude of which people learn when visiting a zoo. This is because some of the public may visit for purely entertaimment, many students and adults paticipate in wide varities of learning acitvities. Saint Louis is a prime example:quot;At the Saint Louis Zoo, about 400,000 children and adults participate in our formal programs, including classes and Camp KangaZoo each year. And of our 3,000,000 visitors annually, about 1,900,000 interact with an educational interpreter, docent or zookeeper who provides educational experiences and information. Each year the Zoo is visited by over 1,400 school groups who come for a free field trip. Of these schoolchildren, 31% are from economically disadvantaged neighborhoods, and 17% are special needs children.quot;[1]http://www.stlzoo.org...... Zoos have a uniqe ability to educate the public, with over 600 million visitors a year.  quot;The chance to see real animals close up can evoke an emotional response, allowing people to attach values to animals, making them aware of the biodiversity crisis, as well as teaching and motivating people (Ballantyne and Packer, 2005; Gwyne, 2007; Fa, Funk and O’Connell, 2011; Rabb and Saunders, 2005). Within this mission, zoos provide an experience which is also recreational but which can inspire cognitive learning, long-term positive attitudes and behaviour change (Broad and Weiler, 1998). provides an opportunity for families to learn in a more relaxed environment, often limited elsewhere (Briseno, Anderson and Anderson, 2007)quot;http://www.iccs.org.uk... Some authors believe that education is more challenging when distracted by entertainment. However studies have shown that many students tend to learn in positive and active enviroments such as zoos.3 Zoos are actually vital to conservation of animals.quot;A species protected in captivity provides a reservoir population against a population crash or extinction in the wild. Here they are relatively safe and can be bred up to provide foundation populations. A good number of species only exist in captivity and still more only exist in the wild because they have been reintroduced from zoos, or the wild populations have been boosted by captive bred animals. Quite simply without these efforts there would be fewer species alive today and ecosystems and the world as a whole would be poorer for it. Although reintroduction successes are few and far between, the numbers are increasing and the very fact that species have been saved or reintroduced as a result of captive breeding shows their value. Even apparently non-threatened species and entire groups can be threatened suddenly (as seen with white nose syndrome in bats and the Chytridiomycosisfungus in amphibians) it’s not just pandas and rhinos that are under threat.quot; https://www.theguardian.com...</t>

    <t>Zoos are are valuable for public education, awareness, and scientific research. Zoos allow humans to connect and learn about animals through a personal level.F or an example to outline the good of zoos, I will be using the Saint Louis Zoo as well as other institutions.1. Many children, as well as adults, visit zoos through field trips formal classes, workshops, tours, outreach programs, camps, lectures etc. To understand this impact lets look at the The Saint Louis zoo:quot;At the Saint Louis Zoo, about 400,000 children and adults participate in our formal programs, including classes and Camp KangaZoo each year. And of our 3,000,000 visitors annually, about 1,900,000 interact with an educational interpreter, docent or zookeeper who provides educational experiences and information. Each year the Zoo is visited by over 1,400 school groups who come for a free field trip. Of these schoolchildren, 31% are from economically disadvantaged neighborhoods, and 17% are special needs children.quot;[1]Zoos can also provide an education far beyond the confines of a classroom, since it allows children (and adults) to be physically awed and inspired by many magnificent creatures. Not only is the learning in the outside world and active, but it gives students greater appreciation of the natural world.[2]2. The rates of animal extinction and endangernment through human acticity grows increasingly alarming everyday. This is a mostly undisputed fact. According to the Center for Bilogical Diversity:quot;Although extinction is a natural phenomenon, it occurs at a natural “background” rate of about one to five species per year. Scientists estimate we’re now losing species at 1,000 to 10,000 times the background rate, with literally dozens going extinct every day,with as many as 30 to 50 percent of all species possibly heading toward extinction by mid-century n fact, 99 percent of currently threatened species are at risk from human activities, primarily those driving habitat loss, introduction of exotic species, and global warming.quot;Zoos can slow the rate of extinction because it allows researchers to analyze the behaviors of animals in their enviroments without expensive expeditions into the wild. This information is valuable to park rangers, nature documentaries, field researchers etc. because of increased understanding on  behavior, reproductive biology, nutrition, animal health and genetics.[4]3. Zoos around the world are leaders in encouraging the safety and protection of animals and wildlife. Man zoos set up insituitons and fundations that work throughout the world to save wild life, beyond just the valuable research they provide. For example, the Saint Louis Zoo quot;has set up the WildCare Institute to work in conservation hotspots locally and around the globe.quot; 4. Of course incidents occur in any facility and intitution, but zoos have taken strides to increase human and wildlife safety.quot;Particularly, those facilities and the individuals employed by them that aspire to the ideals, ethics and ever-increasing standards of animal care and behavioral training represented by organizations such as the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums, the Zoological Association of America, the International Marine Animal Trainers’ Association, and the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, to name a few.quot;-----------Also, I would appreciate if you evidence/citations to support your claims.-----------[1]http://www.stlzoo.org...[2]http://clearingmagazine.org...[3]http://www.biologicaldiversity.org...[4],[5]http://www.stlzoo.org...[6] http://awesomeocean.com...</t>

    <t>I admit the zoos arenapos;t the ideal situation for animals. Some may be kept in cruel and unfortunate cages and concrete slabs. One of your main arguments are that since some animals are mistreated and suffer from mental illness, animals should not be kept in zoos. This disregards not only the potential of zoos to raise awareness, engage the public, increase research, and conserve species, but the strides that many credited, and the most popular and visited, zoos have made. These facilities have teams of experts who analyze the mental state of the animals, massive facilities that are perfectly adequate for animals to roam, and can use these efforts to conserve species world wide. These zoos conform to the AZA standards that enforce strict animal safety. It is true that only 12% of zoos contribute/registered directly to conservation, but many zoos cannot afford to pay for such programs. Instead, the zoos engage the public in learning and interacting with animals on a physical, if not personal, level, which in turn raises appreciation of animals and the therefore an increased effort towards conservation. In the zoos that can afford to be involved in conservation programs, progress has been notable:quot;Most zoos are not only great places to get up close to wildlife, but many are also doing their part to bolster dwindling populations of animals still living free in the wild. To wit, dozens of zoos across North America participate in the Association of Zoos and Aquarium’s (AZA’s) Species Survival Plan (SSP) Program, which aims to manage the breeding of specific endangered species in order to help maintain healthy and self-sustaining populations that are both genetically diverse and demographically stable. The end goal of many SSPs is the reintroduction of captive-raised endangered species into their native wild habitats. According to the AZA, SSPs and related programs have helped bring black-footed ferrets, California condors, red wolves and several other endangered species back from the brink of extinction over the last three decades. Zoos also use SSPs as research tools to better understand wildlife biology and population dynamics, and to raise awareness and funds to support field projects and habitat protection for specific species. AZA now administers some 113 different SSPs covering 181 individual species.quot;[1]There is no doubt that zoos can and do provide valuable researchs and insights into animals, inspire the public to learn about and care for animals, and ensure the survival of species. And the number of zoos that do this grow incresingly everyday. Why do we discourage zoos when the have this potential and the safety and understanding of animals increase everyday? To put this in perspective, Iapos;ll detail I quick scenario that happens in the world today. China is the worldapos;s leading producer of rare earth metals, with an estimate  of 90% of world production, and enforce a strict monopoly. Now, American mining companies have started up with rare earth metals. Some of the mines were shut down for safety/enviromental reasons. However, some mines maintain safe circumstances and are actually more efficient than some Chinese facilities through progress and are slowly but surely lessening the monpoloy. The question is, do we abandon the mines because many mines fail without the proper circumstances, or invest in what can and is beneficial to further increase its abilities to progress and avoid the shut down of an industry?[2] [1]http://www.scientificamerican.com...

    <t>In a British study, 59% of children at the zoo had no positive educational outcomes at a zoo. That number rose to 66% without a guide. In another study, 62% of children had no positive outcome or a negative outcome. One of the researchers for the British study said: quot;In many cases, a trip to the zoo had a negative impact on the childrenquot;s understanding of animals and habitats.quot; Showing children animals in zoos simply teaches them that animals are ours to control. It sets a very bad example. Think of the last time you went to the zoo. Donquot;t lie. You probably didnquot;t learn very much. Sure, you may have read some of the plaques, but more likely you just considered the animals as entertainment. You may have laughed as the otters or seals swam in endless circles in there small pools, or gotten excited when the lion finally paced past the glass where you are standing. But you also may have rolled your eyes and walked right by the bear exhibit when you saw that the polar bears were sleeping (booooring, right?) But you may not have realized that they were sleeping because their body is not meant for the hot climate where you may live.  People can get a lot more educated by simply watching a nature documentary. In this they will see the animals acting normally, and they will see them in their natural habitat. When you see an animal in a zoo you are not seeing them as they would be in the wild. You are seeing a miserable institutionalized animal that is being exploited for entertainment.  As I said before, only 12% of zoos are registered for captive breeding or wildlife conservation. One activist pointed out that quot;Wild animal parks and zoos almost always favor large and charismatic animals.quot; The fact remains that most animals in zoos are not endangered.  Some examples include: Kangaroos, llamas, ostriches, capybaras, emus, black bears, moose, deer, beluga whales, lions, and giraffes. And if we are specifically talking about Seaworld, well, there is no data on whether or not orcas are endangered. So they cannot use that as an excuse.  Human activities that cause pollution, climate change, and the destruction of habitats are not helped by the captive breeding programs, although these problems threaten more than 7000 species. There is no point breeding animals in captivity when one, they cannot be released into the wild because of behavioral issues since they were born in captivity, and two, they have no habitats to go back to. We need to end animal prisons and start raising awareness for the habitat loss that kills millions of animals.  If zoos wanted to encourage the safety of wildlife, they should leave them in the wild where they are happy. Mental health is just as important as physical health.  quot;zoos have taken strides to increase human and wildlife safety.quot;  This supports nothing. Strides means nothing to the animals currently suffering in zoos. Up to 10,000 animals are killed for no reason in European zoos. That does not sound like wildlife safety to me.  And people can talk about education, conservation, and awareness, but the fact is that most zoos are not well respected institutions. They are roadside zoos or entertainment hubs that are NOT non-profit and strive to exploit these animals for their quot;cutenessquot;. It is cruel and inhumane.

    <t>Every time you go to the zoo, you can see how much people are learning. As the spend a few seconds at each exhibit and often taunt the animals for entertainment. Of course, some people do not do this. But that doesnapos;t make it any better. The fact remains, that no matter what zoos do in education or conservation (although they do not do much) they are torture for animals. For example, letapos;s think about elephants. Elephants walk up to 30 miles a day in the wild. It is simply impossible to replicate their habitat in a zoo setting. And it is not natural or safe for them to be in zoos. Zoo animals show the public exactly how they are mentally tortured. You can see it in the way monkeys at zoos sway back and forth (zoochosis) or the way the lion or tiger paces for hours on end. You can see it in the collapsed fins and worn down teeth of the animals at Seaworld. It is simply /not ethical/ to do this to animals. And while a tree frog might not mind living in a zoo, you can bet a tiger hates every second. And letapos;s not forget the endless visitors, camera flashes, and screaming children. It is no way to live.  And letapos;s not forget that even in the best zoos, animals do not live happy enriched lives. They live slightly better lives than the ones in roadside zoos. But not by much.  I have fond memories of zoos, most people do. I remember when I was in a zoo camp and they let me make a salad for the giant tortoise and I got to go into the enclosure with these huge creatures. That was amazing. But I also remember crying as my parents took me to visit the tiger because it was just pacing. Back and forth, all day long. It broke my heart.  And as for conservation, you said it yourself. Few species are successfully reintroduced. And yes, animals can quot;become threatenedquot; but that is definitely not a valid reason to keep them caged up. Giraffes shouldnapos;t be held in small cages because there is a small chance they might become endangered. It is, well, crazy! And letapos;s not forget my other statistic I said, only 12% of zoos are actually registered for conservation.  quot;is it ethical for animals to suffer for the apos;goodapos; of their species?quot;  Well, would you stay locked in a small cage for the good of the human race? I doubt it.  http://www.peta.org...</t>

    <t>Zoos claim to be good for many things, but they do more harm than good overall. Many of the things zoos claim to do could be done better in different ways without caging animals up.  1. They do not educate people well, despite what they claim. Most people just look at the animals in zoos as entertainment.  2. Very few of the animals in zoos are actually endangered. And even less of those endangered animals are actually helped by those programs. Only 12% of all the zoos in the world are actually registered for captive breeding or wildlife conservation.  3. Zoos are dangerous for animals and humans. Many animals in zoos present with forms of depression and psychosis. They also display self mutilation such as the orcas at seaworld gnawing at the side of their pool and wearing their teeth down to nubs. Most of the zoos in the world are not prestigious institutions, they are roadside zoos or entertainment hubs that only care about using the animals for their personal gain. This awful behavior is displayed in books like apos;The One and Only Ivan.apos;</t>

    <t>I understand the argument.  First, 2050 is a projection given by Bill Gates for zero emissions throughout the whole world IF serious and drastic changes are made in reducing of C02 levels. Itapos;s not that they wouldnapos;t take effect until 2050 but rather that humans have to work very hard to reach that point by 2050. I did not mean to attack that specific part of the argument but I just wanted to make that clear.  Now, with that being said, this ties into my argument which is that global warming is a greater issue than poverty.  That is, global warming is effecting us now, as I have said before. Drastic changes are already being made right now in order to make an attempt at reaching that goal of Zero C02 emissions by 2050. So, I must make it clear that climate change is a problem that is effecting all humans, right her and now.  Some current effects of climate change are... -Increased coastal flooding and sea level rise. -More damaging wildfires. -More severe droughts. -More severe deforestation. -More severe health risks to humans by pollution. ...Just to name a few http://www.ucsusa.org... -This website run by the Union of Concerned Scientists evaluates the situation properly.  So, as far as the immediacy of this issue I would argue that is is more so than poverty because it effects everyone one on Earth and mostly because it takes LONGER to fix.  Poverty is an immediate issue currently effecting many people but climate change is also immediate and will take much longer to resolve.  Finally, I would also like to state that the solutions for climate change coincide with the solutions for poverty. Just as an example, the Tesla Power Wall allows consumers to store energy that is collected by solar panels, and use it anytime they want. This will prove to be extremely useful for underdeveloped areas which are not anywhere near a power grid.  In reference to that statement, I argue that solving the climate change issue first would be more beneficial to the human race than attempting the vice-versa option which you are arguing. While I agree that educating people will lead to the reduction of global climate change, I think that by the time every underdeveloped country catches up in education, it will be too late for the earth.  With that, I do believe that global climate change is a greater issue than poverty, and that focusing attention on that would be better for the human race.</t>

    <t>Firstly I would like to apologize to my opponent for missing the last round. it was not my intention to miss the debate, simply the fact that time river and my studies in school demand much of its water.  Now on to my argument  Climate change is an issue. It is definitely going to have major consequences on us in the future if we donapos;t do anything. However, Poverty, education, and hunger are all immediate issues. People are suffering right now and dying right now because of it.  I believe that by declaring war on poverty, lack of knowledge, and hunger, the consequences given by climate change will be much reduced if not completely removed  Firstly, People who are educated poorly practice bad habits that could be avoided if they were properly educated. for example, the practices of mass chopping of trees, excessive fishing, and actions that produce emissions are performed by those who do not know the full extent of what can be caused in the future if they do not change their ways.  Also, educating more people puts more minds to work on solutions to the issues at hand. By putting more effort into allowing people in poverty to obtain the financial recourses to obtain an education, more people will be at work armed with knowledge to help combat climate change.  Which leads me to my next point; poverty. Poverty can be defined as quot;a financial state in which one is not able obtain the basic necessities such as food, water, clothing, etc.quot;. As in your earlier statement, the issues from climate change is a long term issue with plans that donapos;t take effect until 2050, while poverty is causing people to suffer right now. By lessening poverty, we reduce crime rates, increase overall happiness, and make the country more progressive in every way such as services and infrastructure. More jobs, and the economy will roll, allowing people to buy more things, and once again, improve technology.  As for convincing me as a debater, You would have to prove to me that Climate change is a more immediate problem, and that solving it would create more of an overall benefit for the human race  Once again im sorry for not being present for the previous round and i will do my best to be present for the final round</t>

    <t>I thank my opponent for this opportunity. I will be arguing against the statement that quot;Global Poverty, Education, and hunger are greater issues than global climate change.quot; I will begin by defining my terms and clarifying my argument:  Poverty: The state or condition of having little or no money, goods, or means of support; condition of being poor.  Education: The act or process of imparting or acquiring general knowledge, developing the powers of reasoning and judgment, and generally of preparing oneself or others intellectually for mature life.  Hunger :A compelling need or desire for food.  Greater: Unusually or comparatively large in size or dimensions.  Issue: A point in question or a matter that is in dispute, as between contending parties in an action at law.  Climate change: A long-term change in the earthapos;s climate, especially a change due to an increase in the average atmospheric temperature.  All definitions were directly quoted from Dictionary.com: http://dictionary.reference.com... The context of all key terms and words should be understood otherwise I will further elaborate.  When the instigator refers to the issue of education I am assuming that they are talking about the lack of free education in specific countries. Also, I assume that hunger is an Issue that is attached to poverty as a result. With that being said, I understand that lack of education and hunger are typically effects that are caused by poverty.  I am arguing against this claim because I do not believe that it is true. I do believe that poverty is a serious issue. I do believe that every country should allow free education through the 12 grade. I also believe that hunger and death from malnutrition are Important issues.  But, I argue that none of these three issues are as important as Climate change. Hereapos;s why: Poverty, and the issues surrounding it such as hunger and education effect a select few. Climate change effects every single person living on Earth and every single person who ever will live on Earth.  That is my argument, I look forward to this debate.</t>

That is, what can I do, as a debater, to change your mind and make you believe me?  All you have to do is tell me what that is and I will go and get it.  I would also like to provide more evidence: In a TED talk by Bill Gates called quot;Innovating to Zero,quot; the richest man on earth describes the movement towards Zero C02 emissions by 2050. The way that this will happen is through the expansion of renewable energy infrastructure. Now, in reference to this talk, Bill Gates claims that this effort will also greatly reduce poverty as an extra beneficial result. The biggest reason why this is true is because renewable energy structures, in areas of poverty, will greatly increase the standard of living. This is because small villages and communities of extreme poverty are not usually anywhere near an energy grid.</t>

    <t>Sorry for my long delay, I have been busy  Argument: While it is true that currently the climb of global warming is slow, just wait for the quot;point of no return.quot; Havenapos;t heard of it? There are multiple website talking about it, so go search it up. Anyway, the point of no return is basically the fact that when global warming reaches a point of badness, it will tumble, pick up speed, and there will be no way to stop it. One example of this are the polar ice caps melting. As more ice melts, there is more water to attract warmth. As the water gets warmer, the ice melts faster. See how that could tumble out of control? Now, how does this have to do with anything? Well, there will be a quot;runawayquot; in global warming. What is currently a really small amount increase per year, could very well become catastrophic, maybe even 0.5 degrees a year. And it will be near impossible to stop it. If things donapos;t change by 2020, we will hit the point of no return by 2042. Rising temperatures can cause major drought and wildfires (just look at California,) and it can even cause computers to over heat. Imagine what would happen if hospital machines, machines keeping people alive, over heated because of the 120 or so degree Fahrenheit temperatures that could be seen if we donapos;t stop global warming from tipping to the deep end. If all of a sudden, there were no more wars, how would we get everyone to get together, be friends, and stop global warming in such a small time frame. Remember, most of the worldapos;s economies rely of burning coal and oil, which causes global warming. So, even if everyone unified all of a sudden, which isnapos;t very likely, there would be a huge risk of destroying all economies to fix it. And if everyone destroyapos;s their economy to fix global warming, how can they help the others with dead economies. Huh, not very black and white, is it?</t>

    <t>First off, Pro states that plants would be shriveling and dying because of the greater temperature. Iapos;d like to point out that while that is a sobering possibility, it wouldnapos;t be happening anywhere in the near future. According to the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, the global temperature has risen 1.53 (Fahrenheit) since the Industrial Revolution. In about two and a half centuries, our global temperature has only gone up by that non-remarkable amount (0.00612 per year). In 50 years, our global temperature will have risen only .3 degrees Fahrenheit. I donapos;t believe thatapos;s a large enough amount to carry any significance in it.  As for the prospect of weighing human lives on a scale, so many more lives would be saved if we were to have world peace. Pro states that wars only occur every 20 or so years and cause tens of millions of inexcusable deaths, however, global warming causes 400,000 deaths a year. Iapos;d like to point out that these figures are questionable, and that even if tens of millions of people did die in these quot;superwarsquot; that occur every other decade, the proportion of deaths per year is greater by that of which caused by war. (ten million / 20 = 500,000).  Next, wars donapos;t occur just every 20 years. Especially from our developed countryapos;s biased eye, we love to twist figures. Our globe is in chaos right now. Just look at the Yemen Civil War or the infamous ISIS fight. It doesnapos;t take an extremely bloody war to capture our attention.  We have the power to destroy ourselves right now, and the only thing stopping us from doing so is the knowledge that others contain that power also.  War is a terrible thing, and world cooperation would be the easiest solution to our problems.</t>

    <t>Alright. First things first (Iapos;m the realest..gosh that songapos;s old), if we were to ensure the cooperation of our world organization, then we could accomplish so much more! Our world is run on money and competition. Greed is embodied into our human nature. However, if we were to collaborate, we could tackle this problem of global warming together. Thus, world peace places a higher priority on our list than global warming. Next, letapos;s again remind ourselves that the rate of increase in temperature is 0.00612 degrees Fahrenheit per year. This minuscule figure tells us that we should have nothing to worry about. Therefore, Iapos;d like to kindly remind Pro to chill out (pun intended) and remember that the world isnapos;t anywhere near falling over the pit yet. Because of our natural urge to want more for ourselves, yes, we do fight wars over resources. Pro states it himself-they can contribute to the fire that fuels the flame for a war. However, we are nowhere near burning up.  Therefore, I conclude my argument, and thus, the debate, with the notion that our society as the human race should focus on discontinue our quarrels and turn our eyes to the greater issues.

Thatapos;s going to be hard to fix if all the plants are shriveling and dying because of the over-livable heat! Many websites say that if global warming was stopped, it would help world peace a lot. Oil and coal are major contributors in a strong economy, and can be a large point in a war. If we stop global warming by not burning and using the resources, we no longer have that strong reason to go to war. Also, global warming is causing a lot more than fiercer storms. Lots of people may die in wars, but how many people are dying by abnormally large tsunamis and hurricanes, which are larger due to global warming. War happens once every 20 or so years and kill a few ten million each time, which is a lot and is inexcusable. Global warming, however, kills about 400,000 people a year[1] (through means of tsunamis, hurricanes, etc.), and that number is constantly growing. True, it currently doesnapos;t kill as many as wars do, but what about in 50 years?  [1] http://goo.gl...</t>

And yet, we are still alive and quot;healthyquot;. Global warming, on the other hand, is a new problem. A new problem that isnquot;t going away. Our ice caps are melting, raising our temperatures and killing hundreds of arctic animals. By raising temperatures, itquot;s evaporating more water, making the ground dryer, making it harder for plants to grow. Less plants, less food, less people. Not to mention the fact that itquot;s incredibly uncomfortable to be in super hot weather. Plus, if global warming is stopped by no longer burning oil, there is no longer the danger of what would happen if there is no more oil to burn. In short, wars will always be a problem, but it will never threaten our extinction. Unless stopped, global warming will.</t>

    <t>To consider this resolution and evaluate both possible solutions a few things must be established. Firstly, the main value that both sides are defending is the value of human life. The common goal is saving the most possible humans. The pro side will be arguing that preparation is fundamental and necessary to achieve this while the con should be arguing that reducing the damage to the environment is enough. Before I lay out my arguments I would like to make one clarification: the pro side is not arguing that prevention is the ultimate solution. Instead, we will prove that it should be the immediate and necessary action.  These are our reasons:  1. We will suffer the consequences of climate change. (It will rise above 2 C).  The vast majority of scientists agree that a rise in the average temperature of the world above 2 degrees Celsius from before industrial levels will be extremely catastrophic to the human population. This is a very alarming fact because we have already risen 1 degree above these industrial levels, and from the current course we have set our industries on, it is virtually impossible to prevent going above 2 C. This means we WILL deal with the catastrophic damage of climate change! Now the question is what is the best solution to deal with these consequences such as extreme droughts, flooding, harsh storms, etc.? The solution proposed by the the opposition is completely inviable since switching to green energy or any other measure will not save the lives of the people whose house was washed away by floods or who do not have water to drink. Iquot;m from Brazil and recently we have had the worst drought in 50 years. This made a many people realize the importance of the environment and start taking actions to help it, yet that did not solve the immediate problem. People still did not have water to live! Preparation was necessary and would have remediated the issue. This same logic can be applied to the rest of the world. We need to be prepared to face what is coming, and that is why it should be our main goal.  2. Not all nations will agree on preventing climate change; therefore, nations that do not prepare for its effects will be harmed.  One example of this is China, one of the biggest producers of greenhouse gases, which has recently stated that it would not maintain its emission control pledges. As a result of that, it is inevitable that significant damage will occur due to climate change. It is nearly impossible to force countries like this to comply with climate change prevention measures; therefore, it would be more beneficial for the other nations to prepare themselves to the effects of climate change rather than spending trillions on trying to prevent it in vain. How can you ask a small country like the Maldives to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions when the sea is rising and destroying their cities? Even if they did agree to take these measures, because other countries like China donquot;t, the seas will continue to rise. Their main concern currently should be to prepare with the effects of this rise.  3. It would be illogical for a few countries to make the change to green technology because of the magnitude of capital investment in the oil amp; gas industry.  The oil amp; gas industry is a billion dollar industry. Only in the time period 2009-13 more than 3000 billion dollars were invested in the oil amp; gas industry. It is needless to point out the huge negative effects the adoption of green technology would mean for the world economy. The results would be catastrophic and there would be no turning back. Thousands of people would lose their jobs and years of technological developments in the industry would be wasted. It would cost 44 trillion dollars to switch from fossil fuels to green energy. The cost of this is unviable. There are no investors willing to spend that much money on green technology. Logically, the costs would be split. However, given the profits the oil industry brings only a crazy person would spend on green technology. This once again demonstrates how prevention is completely impossible in our world and preparation is the best immediate solution.  4. If climate change prevention does not work, then mankind would have wasted all of its resources into something futile, and we would not be able to survive the effects of climate change.  In order to change the ways of mankind now, we would have to change so many habits that have been ingrained in our society for decades, since the discovery of oil. How we run our factories, how we trade, change all of the packaging on foods, beauty products, even clothing. It is impossible to impede the productions of these items, since nowadays fossil fuels are present all around us. The keyboard you are typing on is made of plastic for example, the case around your phone is plastic as well. It is incoherent to assume that we can slow this process now, so instead of spending trillions on prevention methods that we are not certain can work (they havenquot;t until now), we must start thinking about the future, and preparing for the worst that can come. One of the largest mistakes that humanity makes is to begin something and not look deep enough into the future to know how to control that something. This is not a fatalistic view, it is a cautious one.  For all these reasons, we are arguing that the preparation to deal with climate change should currently be valued above preventing the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Arguing that suddenly changing the path we are on will happen and is viable is thinking of a utopian world. It is a completely inviable solution. The main goal of nations should be to prepare, and later, when the mentality concerning climate change starts to shift, prevention can be discussed.</t>

    <t>No one is denying that climate change is upon us. The present effects of global warming and other forms of climate change are well documented. As we see it, the people of the world have two choices: --shore up our defenses against the worst effects of climate change and hope that we wonquot;t eventually be incapable of coping with the rising seas, floods, droughts, disease, etc. that are even now threatening communities on every continent, or  --focus our energies and resources on preventing further climate change damage to mitigate the impact on humanity and planet.  Given the ominous fact that there is nothing that can be done to immediately halt and reverse the effects of climate change, humans need to take the long view. Where will we be in 50 or 100 years if we fail to take steps now to prevent even greater climate change? The effects we are feeling now are so threatening to human health and the ecosystems we depend upon that it is inconceivable we could survive many generations at the current rate of damage. The alternative to real and concerted prevention of further climate change, is to accept a future in which the people of Earth who are not killed by heat waves, mosquito-born diseases, floods, famines and the other inevitable effects of global warming find themselves fighting over the few verdant patches of land high enough to escape seas that have risen [find stat] feet once the polar ice caps have melted completely. The preparation position is a fatalistic one. It accepts the eventual demise of humankind. The only viable position is the prevention of further climate change in hopes of reestablishing ecological balance in the world. No amount of raising levees, recycling water, or distributing mosquito nets will be sufficient over time to save our race and the world from the climate change damage we have put in motion. Given a choice between preparing for the worst, and attempting to prevent the worst--humanityquot;s best hope lies in prevention. We must do everything we can, starting now, to halt the shameful dependence on fossil fuels, the destruction of tropical rainforests, and pumping of hydrocarbons into the air.</t>

Definitions: Tech: Technology Technology: The application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, especially in industry.  Technology Enhances amp; Improves Life: “Has tech wizard made our life graceless” - Pro “From evolution we got tech and now our condition is deteriorating” - Pro Pro has not said much to support his assertion, so we’ll discuss how technology enhances and improves life. Technology has not made our existences any less graceful. Rather, it has opened many new opportunities and has advanced the human race as a whole. Examples of this include, but are not limited to: 1) Leaving the planet’s atmosphere and venturing into space. 2) The creation of automobiles, which are used on a daily basis for transportation. 3) Many medical advancements. 4) The vast improvement of communication with the ability to simply contact people around the world using the Internet, as well as being able to upload images and videos to show friends or family, via social media. 5) The primary cause of many great scientific discoveries, which allow us to learn more about ourselves, the universe, and our history. 6) The immense warehouse of knowledge and information that nearly everyone can access known as the Internet. These are only a few things that indicate how technology has done the opposite of what Pro claims. Not to mention, each of these differing aspects are continually evolving to have even more positive impacts on our lives. Technology makes things more efficient, which gives us time to spend on other things, it lets us live longer, and has made communication faster than it’s ever been before. It is certainly not reducing our gracefulness.   Social Media Is Not All-Consuming: “Yes the techs have made us cattle who are following the same path of getting a apos;likeapos; .” -Pro Social media is not as destructive as Pro implicates. While some users may just be in it for the likes, not all of them are. It is unreasonable for Pro to attack all of social media for the faults of a (relatively small) portion of the users. Social media is not a quest to gain likes, but rather, it is a tool inherently meant for the sharing of information with family, friends, and the world. It is more efficient than texting and email in some ways, which is why people prefer it. Social media has contributed to the development of businesses, and therefore, the economy, and also has been used as announcement platforms for movements and organizations. To get the point across that social media is not all-consuming, let’s look at the figures for traffic for a few popular sites. Facebook has roughly 1.55 billion monthly users, and around 800 million daily users. The current human population is at an estimated 7.4 billion people. Looking at it from a statistical standpoint, ~20% of the complete population uses Facebook monthly, while ~10% visit Facebook daily. This leaves a staggering 80% people who don’t even touch Facebook on a monthly basis, as well as 90% who don’t use Facebook daily. [1] Instagram has around 400 million monthly users, which adds up to a small 5% of the population using it, leaving 95% who don’t. [1] And finally, Twitter has monthly active user base of about 320 million. That’s 4% out of 96% who don’t use it. [1] It’s worth noting as well that these user bases are not mutually exclusive. There’s a large chance that users who use Facebook will also use other social media platforms and vice-versa. These figures indicate that there is a massive amount of people who don’t even bother with social media in general, much less spend time blatantly pursuing likes. Essentially everyone who uses social media is there by their own choice; they are not being forced by some higher-ups. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- I will not address Pro’s, “Its well said one cannot resist it but it also creates a loophole for the unsocial people who are craving for destroying worlds peace” statement, as it is unclear what the intention and meaning behind it is. If Pro would like to offer more insight, I would be more than happy to talk about it. In conclusion, technology’s benefits far outweigh any negatives that could come up and social media is not what Pro indicates that it is. The burden of proof now lies upon Pro to provide a compelling argument as to how technology is damaging society and how social media is transforming the population into mindless cattle. Vote Con.

    <t>Pro has ventured away from his original resolution that technology is making humans graceless by bringing up issues like global warming and climate change. These are red herrings, so I will therefore not address them. [1] Overpopulation: To be brief, overpopulation isn’t necessarily even an issue. It’s essentially a myth being perpetuated by the ignorant. [2] Social Media: “These things possesses a danger of sharing any sensitive information in a blink of eyes  .“ -Pro Pro is referring to the potential of sensitive information being shared on social media. The issue with this is that users on social media have the choice to post as they please. It is their own fault and responsibility if their information is leaked, not the fault of technology. The cases of unwanted events being shared in the form of cyberbullying are so limited that it has virtually no effect on the human race in total. Pro fails to address that essentially ~75% of human beings don’t even use social media (not including bots or sockpuppets that have social media accounts, which I didn’t mention previously). [see previous figures in R1] Deadly Weapons amp; The Atomic Bomb: Whether or not the creation of deadly weapons and the usage of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki are bad is both questionable and subjective. Not fact, as Pro claims in their conclusion. War: Simply put, war is perpetuated by human beings, not by technology. The complete removal of technology would not end war. If technology never even existed, war would still go on. That is human nature. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Pro’s arguments are flawed and my primary points remain virtually unrefuted. Pro’s conclusion states that his points are facts when in reality, most of them are extremely subjective and nothing more than opinions. Pro also used a strawman logical fallacy in the end of their conclusion in an effort to make some points I brought up earlier seem notably more ridiculous and unimportant.

    <t>I think green spaces are more important than expansion of cities for economic progress. I can give many reasons..... Economic benefits- Houses close to parks are on average 8% more expensive than similar properties further away. Greener cities attract more visitors, whose spending on shopping and leisure generates job opportunities. Health benefits-People who use green spaces are more likely to take exercise than those who donquot;t, and that the attractiveness or quality of green space is important: people donquot;t want to use neglected parks or open spaces. The more time people spend outdoors the less stressed they feel quot; an important consideration given the cost to the UK economy of depression and mental illness, which has been calculated at quot;26.1bn. Social benefits-Academic studies tend to support the relationship between well maintained local green spaces and peoplequot;s feeling of belonging. People who live near green spaces are more likely to feel a sense of attachment. In Zurich, researchers found youths were more likely to meet and make friends with people from non-Swiss backgrounds in the cityquot;s parks.

    <t>== Intro ==  A carbon tax is a tax levied on the carbon content of fuels, which results in most carbon emissions -- emissions of carbon dioxide, which increases temperature, and occasionally carbon monoxide, which is toxic. The resolution says the United States should introduce a carbon tax.  The government legislates pragmatically, based on what benefits and harms the people. The job of the State is to ensure that the people arenapos;t harmed. Thus, government legislation ought to be based on John Stuart Millapos;s quot;harm principle,quot; which holds that the only purpose for which control can be exercised over a person who doesnapos;t consent to it is to prevent harm to non-consensual others. There are two reasons to accept this. First, the only reason people recognize the governmentapos;s legitimacy is to prevent harm to themselves and to maximize benefit for themselves. If the government doesnapos;t follow the harm principle, it is illegitimate. Second, the harm principle fits with normal conceptions of ethics in that it prevents harm.  What are the burdens in this debate? The debate is a normative resolution, which means the burdens of persuasion are shared. The word quot;shouldquot; implies a debate of opinions, and, therefore, requires both sides to justify that opinion. My burden is to show that a carbon tax would be a net benefit to society. Conapos;s burden is to show that it would be a net harm.  == Climate change ==  Global warming is primarily human-caused and poses a fairly significant threat to humanity. Most scientists agree on that. The scientific consensus on climate change is that itapos;s primarily human-caused. Human-emitted greenhouse gases trap insolation within the Earth, and increase its mean temperature. Carbon dioxide has a huge impact on temperature. Research by most scientists confirms so. Leading climatologist JD Annan uses a Bayesian statistical approach, which is quot;dominant in the literature,quot; and finds that mean temperature would increase by 3 degrees Celsius per doubling of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. [1] That would mean carbon dioxide is responsible for around 70% of global warming.  The effects of climate change on humans is severe. Thereapos;s immense urgency as to the effect of climate change, and the problem is on a huge scale. If greenhouse emissions continue at the current rate, climate change will make the planet uninhabitable to humans. [2]  A carbon tax would act to mitigate global warming. With a tax on carbon emissions, it will deter people from using carbon-content fuels at high levels, therefore reducing carbon emissions. Carbon taxation is not very costly, and has been proven to be effective at reducing emissions, therefore mitigating the threat of global warming. Research has shown that Norwayapos;s carbon tax has reduced carbon-based pollution by 20%. [3]  == Nuclear power ==  Implementing a carbon tax will deter people from using carbon-based fuels. That much has been established by lots of research, and has been observed in Norwayapos;s carbon tax. Logically, it entails that people will look for alternatives. Most people agree that nuclear power will present significant competition to coal energy if a carbon tax is enacted. [4] Nuclear power poses a net benefit to society. Nuclear power further helps mitigate the threat of climate change. Itapos;s more efficient than many other forms of energy, and produces the most electricity in relation to itapos;s minimal environmental impact.  Nuclear power is helpful, because it has very little pollution and poses a viable power source. Therefore, itapos;s a benefit to the plan.  Climate change poses a harm to people. A carbon tax would mitigate that harm. The governmentapos;s job is to prevent or reduce harm. For those reasons, vote Pro.  [1] http://tinyurl.com... [2] http://tinyurl.com...

    <t>Iapos;m disappointed that my opponent forfeited. Itapos;s considered common courtesy that you have a no-forfeit guarantee when you apply in the comments section of the debate. Iapos;ll crystallize my points and show you why you should vote Pro:  Thereapos;s immense urgency to the crisis of climate change now. Temperatures are rising at rates much faster than people think. Carbon dioxide concentrations are constantly rising, and if theyapos;re doubled, itapos;ll mean a three-degree Celsius rise in temperature. At the current rate of carbon emissions, the human race will go extinct. I understand that there are studies doubting the impact of global warming, and many researchers think the climate sensitivity is at 1.1 degrees Celsius. But there are various studies that show much higher climate sensitivities. Many of these studies use climate models, which many skeptical researchers -- and even some members on this site who believe in anthropogenic global warming, such as 16k -- doubt, but the consensus is that climate models work. And there are many non-modeling studies as well, such as the one I cited by JD Annan, that uses a Bayesian statistical approach, which is the dominant method in the literature. All of these entail a major urgency to climate change.  Of course, many people -- even those who actually acknowledge this -- just sit in front of their computers debating, and donapos;t stop to ponder how huge the impact is. Itapos;s enormous. Stop for a second and close your eyes, and imagine if conditions were as Iapos;m saying. Donapos;t just think quot;ok, this is a debate, this is fun to read,quot; or donapos;t be just a judge for this debate, or a person whoapos;s interested. Think as a person who actually cares for the race, and for their own lives. Imagine heat waves everywhere killing many. Imagine floods, many more storms, and multiple phenomena causing them. Many satirists have jokes -- extremely realistic ones -- on how people just care about those that died in a flood just for those two weeks or so. I, like most other humans, was like that; I cared, but I soon forgot. Until I experienced the devastation caused by floods, and witnessed the sheer human fear and panic thatapos;s so inherent. Just post the Chennai floods, there was a rumor that a damapos;s wall had collapsed -- and at that moment, those that had lost so much just ran, and you could see the fear in their faces. The rumor was a false one. But that helped me appreciate how serious any loss is. Nearly dying changes nothing. Someone else dying changes nothing. But dying changes everything. Ponder for a moment about that, and imagine the sheer impact caused by climate change. That can be mitigated by a carbon tax.  Imagine the reduction in fear. Think of that slight mitigation that could prevent the brutal, horrifying specter of change and death. Just creating a tax would stop that. It would mitigate heat waves and flooding. quot;Burning all fossil fuels . . . would make most of this planet uninhabitable to humans.quot; [2] Thatapos;s why you should vote Pro. The magnitude of the impact is so immense, itapos;s close to nuclear impacts in quot;North Korea vs Iranquot; policy debates. Iapos;m sure most people didnapos;t imagine a debate about taxation comes to that -- but it does.  Nuclear power is another, smaller, impact. Thereapos;s little question that nuclear power is immensely beneficial to society. It doesnapos;t pollute much, thereapos;s a very low risk of emergency scenarios, and it benefits the economy. A carbon tax increases that. Itapos;s much simpler than the above impact.  For these reasons, vote Pro.</t>

    <t>The word apos;mainapos; as used in the debate heading presents the position that humanityapos;s contribution to global warming is greater in magnitude than any other factor. The definition of apos;mainapos; could be explained as: chief or principal in rank, importance, size, etc. Therefore, Pro must prove that the human portion is in fact the largest of factors. Of course, the human portion neednapos;t be greater than 50% of the total effect if there are multiple elements/factors at play. I also agree that it is more than possible that human activities could affect, change or initiate natural processes, but again, that would have to be quantified (what portion of a natural system has been altered by human elements versus natural change). Natural and human effect can be intertwined and extremely complicated, if not impossible to differentiate and separate. This is referred to as the quot;attribution of recent climate changequot;. I will reference the following scholarly article: https://gfdl.noaa.gov... quot;Detection and Attribution of Recent Climate Change: A Status Reportquot;. The authors make several important conclusions in this comprehensive study: quot;Greenhouse warming alone is insufficient to explain the observed pattern of climate change.quot; and quot;The most probable cause of the observed warming is a combination of internally and externally forced natural variability and anthropogenic sources (see also Tett et al. 1999). But given the large model uncertainties and limited data, a reliable weighting of the different factors contributing to the observed climate change cannot currently be given. In short, we cannot attribute, at this time, with a high level of statistical significance, the observed changes in global and large-scale regional climate to anthropogenic forcing alone.quot;. This research contradicts Proapos;s assertion that human causes are definitively more important than natural ones. In addition, to say that our current warming trend was caused solely by the industrial age based on the chart I presented (in round 3) would be to dismiss the fact that the sharp rebound from the Little Ice Age and commencement of our current warming trend (1600-) was initiated and occurred well before human activity was a relevant factor. I agree with much of the content contained within the two sites referenced by pro, but none of them contains information that establishes that human activity plays a greater role than natural variability. The CO2 now website asserts that quot;The human impact on climate during this era greatly exceeds that due to known changes in natural processes, such as solar changes and volcanic eruptions.quot; and lists several of the unique contributions and circumstances associated with human activity and greenhouse gasses. It also states that quot;the radiative forcing from human activities is much more important for current and future climate change than the estimated radiative forcing from changes in natural processes.quot; These are grand statements, but there is no attempt to quantify them unlike the formal research document I presented above (which contradicts these sites). There is also no mention on Proapos;s sites of the fact that our current warming period was initiated well before the industrial age and human influence by natural forces. Even the IPCC continues to protect its reputation by using vague terms such as quot;...likelyquot; regarding the position of humanityapos;s quot;...dominant role in global warmingquot;. I acknowledge that we currently are experiencing global warming. For those who lived in 1100 BC and 1300 AD, they also experienced global warming on a larger scale than we do today, even though human activity had little correlation to that warming. Thus, to say that Global Warming is unique to the industrial age is false. It is also very likely that scientists will one day be able to prove/quantify what portion of Human Activity is attributable to global warming. Presently, it is not possible as my opponent acknowledges. This is why no scientist(s) or scientific body has declared a victory on this issue (A quantified attribution of recent climate change). In fact, a very large amount of money and large amount of research continues to be spent on this very issue because it has yet to be proved or resolved. I also agree that the current warming period presented on the on the chart I referenced is abrupt and is likely a reflection of the influence of human activity. Being that this warming period has yet to exceed several recent warming periods in effect and duration, we need more time in order to be able to place our current warming period into the context of other prior larger warming periods. It is simply premature to state definitively that human activity is the main factor in global warming. My statement is reflected in the current feverish rate of research being performed into the Attribution of Recent Climate Change. If a definitive conclusion had been reached, this research would not be needed to such a degree. Keep in mind, that I am not advocating that humanity should not take responsibility towards reducing our greenhouse gas emissions; quite the contrary.</t>

    <t>I never said that Mankind is the sole cause of global warming. Iapos;m saying they are the main cause of global warming. According to the chart provided by Con in the previous argument, we are supposed going through a clod period. Then how come that 14 of the 15 hottest years are in the 21st century? This is shown in Wiki page of Global Warming. Therefore I respectfully say that the site might be wrong. Its true , there have been cold periods every year. But I think those are called winters. Another reason. Global Warming is primarily caused by emission of GHGs, or Greenhouse gases. The primary sources of GHGs are factories and automobiles . Which are human sources. The only major contributor from the natural side are trees which only emit CO2 during the night. Whereas human sources include, CO, CO2, nitrous oxide, methane and other synthetic chemicals emitted is vapour form by humans. And with the tree population declining, and not many volcanoes in the past 10 years, the GHG emission by nature are not that significant as mankind. http://environment.nationalgeographic.com... And contrary to common perception there has not been any cool period, the average surface temperature of the planet has been constantly increasing. The concentration of CO2 has been up about 20% from 650,000 years ago. Con has failed to rebut the argument of radioactive forcing which was in one of my sources. Just because its contribution cannot be quantified, doesnapos;t mean it is not the major contributor. http://www3.epa.gov... In the above site, research has indicated that natural causes do not explain the recent climate changes . ( Ever since the Industrial Revolution). The site also gives the natural causes of climate change. 1)Variations in the sunapos;s energy reaching Earth 2)Changes in the reflectivity of Earthquot;s atmosphere and surface 3)Changes in the greenhouse effect, which affects the amount of heat retained by Earthquot;s atmosphere 1)Its true that there have been changes in the Sunapos;s energy reaching the Earth but none big enough to cause such a change in surface temperature ALONE. 2) The constant GHG emissions have damaged our ozone layer and are causing UV rays to enter the atmosphere which is also increase the temperature of the planet. Again . A human source. 3) The changes in the GreenHouse effect, is that we humans have been constantly increasing the amount of GHGs in the atmosphere in our quest for development and comfort. A human source. 4) There have been no volcanic eruptions, atleast not big enough for the atmosphere to change and for the aerosol count to become so high. Therefore one can conclude that a human source is now behind almost every natural cause that MAY have caused this spike in temperature. Therefore Humanity is the Main Cause of Global Warming.</t>

    <t>First of all I would like to apologise for themy forfeiture, as my internet connection was not available for a few days. I hope that voters disregard the forfeit. My opening statements. 1) Humanity IS the main cause of global warming.The IPCC Report of 2015 states: Its extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 wascaused by the anthropogenic increase in GHG concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together. The best estimate of the human-induced contribution to warming is similar to the observed warming over this period . Anthro-pogenic forcings have likely made a substantial contribution to surface temperature increases since the mid-20th century over every continental region except Antarctica.. Anthropogenic influences have likely affected the global water cycle since 1960 and contributed to the retreat of glaciers since the 1960s and to the increased surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet since 1993. Anthropogenic influences have very likely contributed to Arctic sea-ice loss since 1979 and have very likely made a substantial contribution to increases in global upper ocean heat content (0quot;quot;700 m) and to global mean sea level rise observed since the 1970s.quot;One of the major contributions to global warming is caused by automobiles, a man made i.e. anthropogenic industry.Other include garbage disposal, factories, burning of leaves , bonfires etc. All of these are anthropogenic causes. 2) One could argue that global warming would take place with or without humanity , but that is not and would not have been the case. Global warming is not JUST the warming of the Earth , it is the EXCESSIVE warming of the Earthapos;s atmosphere. 3) The following site also concludes that mankind is the main contributing factor of global warming. http://timeforchange.org... My Rebuttals 1) Conapos;s source itself says that human activities have contributed substantially to climate change I.e. global warming. 2) I didnapos;t know that global warming consisted of parts. Global warming, simply put is the heating up of the earth, which is mainly caused by greenhouse gases which are emitted by both anthropogenic and natural sources. But the amount is substantially more by man made sources. 3) Another reason given by Conapos;s site is the sunapos;s reflectivity , which can also be altered by human activities. 4) This debate is not whether this is the Little Ice Age or any other age. Its about mankindapos;s impact on global warming. 5) Even if the role of Ice Age is as important as it is alleged, it cannot overtake the impact of civilization and development.</t>

    <t>I will restate, than in order to establish that the primary cause of global warming is human activity, it is necessary to quantify the amount and effect (not qualify). No scientist or scientific body to date, to my knowledge, has been able to do so. Specifically, anyone making the assertion that humans are the primary cause of global warming must scientifically establish/prove what percentage is human as compare to natural variability and natural causes. It is not good enough to use terms such as quot;significantquot; and quot;substantiallyquot; as they are extremely vague inconclusive terms. An even worse approach is to take the line of reasoning presented on the timeforchange.org site referenced by my opponent, which virtually ignores the question/possibility of natural factors. I will reference the following chart by Climatologist Cliff Harris and Meteorologist Randy Mann to illustrate my position: http://www.longrangeweather.com... Note that on this chart there have been two periods with higher and more prolonged global warming periods in 1100 BC and 1300 AD (up to two-fold greater). My opponent also dismissed the importance of the naturally occurring little ice-age, yet its effect was over three-fold greater than our so called current quot;humanquot; caused warming period. Being that natural causes are scientifically established to have created global temperature swings 3 times larger, and hundreds of years longer in duration than our current warming period (as recent as 1600 - 1800 AD), it is complete pseudo-science to claim that natural cycles play an insignificant role in global temperature change. In fact, being that we are presently in a period where we would naturally expect to see a warming period in the natural global temperature cycle, one would expect that human activity would have created the largest warming event in the last 5000 years. The chart/link I presented establishes that this kind of warming simply hasnapos;t happened. The evidence I presented could even be used as an argument that Mankindapos;s impact on global warming is negligible as compared to natural variability. Lastly, I acknowledge that my sources attribute a portion of climate change to human activity, but again, quot;significantquot; and quot;substantiallyquot; is not a quantification as I asserted earlier. I would ask that my opponent reference scholarly material that definitively establishes that human activity outweighs all other possible natural elements and variables in global climate change.</t>

    <t>Firstly. I have not quantified anything in the heading of the debate. Iapos;ve said apos;main causeapos;. Not apos;more than fifty percentapos; or somethinglike that. Main means a major portion. Since when did apos;substantiallyapos; get used for a small portion? And it is also not my possible (to my knowledge) to quantify the impact of natural causes on climate change as it is unpredictable and can change any time. Con has also left out my point that human activities can alter the natural conditions of the earth, therefore any change in temperature due to natural causes could have a human factor behind it. As explained in the following. http://co2now.org... Secondly, I never said natural causes play an insignificant role. I said they play an important role but not as important as human causes. In conapos;s reference chart, the temperature has been constantly oscillating between hot and cold, but if you check recent years there have been almost two constant hot periods and the cold period is almost invisible ( in the graph I mean) meaning it is very short. And then in the graph itself it clear that the hot periods have been on the rise since the Age of Induatrialization. And after 2015, the cold period is based on assumptions and predictions, and as I have already made clear that nature cannot always be predicted. Thirdly Global Warming is a reality. Just because there have hotter periods before, doesnapos;t mean it is not happening. The following site also explains that the global warming hiatus in recent times is not true. And that climate only causes short term changes in the climate of the earth, but human activity causes long term changes. http://www.bbc.com... Fourthly scientists will not quanitfy and agree that mankind is responsible for global warming, as it is their community that are primary responsible (in humans). But I will not defame them as some ARE trying their best to prove it. Fifthly , again I refer to the chart provided by Con, the hot periods have gradually developed over a period of time, but in recent years its almost at a right angle. Which means there have been sharp and quick increase in the heat all over the globe.</t>

    <t>Yes, I agree with Proapos;s sources in Round 5 that list all of the ways in which human activity plays a role in affecting global climate. Unfortunately, Pro failed to acknowledge the issue of quot;Attribution of Recent Climate Changequot; which I brought up in Round 4. Without doing so, it is impossible to conclude that quot;...Humanity is the Main Cause of Global Warmingquot; as Pro has done. To further bolster my argument, I will reference the 376 page scholarly book (published in 2015) quot;Climate Change, Multidecadal and Beyondquot; https://books.google.ca... which flatly states outright in the introduction quot;Many questions concerning the nature and causes of climate variability on the multidecadal time scale are still unresolved.quot;. This book also references a Technical Summary of the IPCCapos;s Fourth Assessment Report which acknowledges quot;Difficulties remain in attributing temperature changes at smaller than continental scales and over time scales less than 50 years.quot; (Solomon et al., 2007). While generalist websites for the public (such as the ones referenced by pro) may ignore the issue of attribution, clearly scholars and climate scientists cannot and do not. The book I referenced demonstrates that scientists are working very hard on the attribution issue, and may resolve it in the near future thanks to ever improving technology, statistics and modeling. However, being that the worldapos;s top scientists have not resolved the issue of climate change attribution, it is far too premature for quot;proquot; declare a victory or a conclusion that humanity is the quot;mainquot; cause of climate change (based on the information contained in generalist websites), especially in the context of a Multidecadal view. I was very much hoping that Pro would address the issue of apos;Attribution of Recent Climate Changeapos; which I introduced in Round 4. In conclusion, I would like to thank my opponent for a robust and civil debate on this important issue.</t>

    <t>In deference to my opponents forfeiture of the first round, I would make the opening statement for this debate. I do not dispute the existence and reality of Global Warming. I do assert, however, that it is impossible to quantify on a global scale, what part of global warming is attributable to Human activities as compared to natural change. Therefore, to state that humanity is the main cause of global warming is, at time present, impossible to prove. Geographers and Geologists consider the state of the Earth at time present to be in an ice age, albeit a late stage. This means that there have been periods in the history of the earth with less ice coverage, higher sea levels, and warmer mean global temperatures. As an example, a major component of the Glacial retreat we are witnessing today is attributable to natural rebound from the little ice age (approximately 1300 to 1850). Certainly human activity has amplified this rebound, but to what degree is indefinable. There are also many other potential amplifying factors, a few of which are listed on the Environmental Protection Agencies Website: http://www3.epa.gov... Note, that even this reputable website is unable to quantify human contribution vs natural causes. I will also cite an article on the little ice-age for the benefit of my opponent: http://www.britannica.com... I would also refer my opponent to the regional research of Glaciologist Dr. Johannes Koch regarding glacial retreat in Garibaldi Park (and other regional locations) which document the geological evidence of glacial retreat since the Little Ice Age glacial extant. The immense role of the Little Ice Age on climate is well established in this research. http://kochj.brandonu.ca... or http://kochj.brandonu.ca...</t>

    <t>Framework:Economic Globalization: “The trans-national increase in trade and capital transfers across national boundaries.” [http://tinyurl.com...] If I can prove economic globalization will have a net negative effect, I win. If my opponent proves the converse, he/she wins. Environmental Concerns:Generally, as income increases, so does production and consumption. These trends facilitate a rampant increase in pollution. Obviously, pollution isn’t something that is a net positive for society or for environment, as environment destruction has a subsequent negative effect on society. Pollution, as it is increased by economic globalization, creates an “Inverse-U” graph of environmental decay, called the Kuznets Curve. Environmental degradation is an irreversible cost of economic globalization, as demonstrated by the graph below:     [http://www.trunity.net...] Essentially, when economic globalization begins, the short-term effects on environment are empirically harmful. However, assuming economic globalization is successful in poverty reduction, the curve is completed and environmental degradation slows. Regardless, the initial impact on environment is irreversible and extremely harmful. For the preservation of the environment, it’s imperative we don’t utilize economic globalization as an international policy.This point is important, and I think it needs further explanation. It’s necessary to understand the effects of globalization are far-reaching, not confined to developed or developing countries. It applies to both of them, and that’s a basis for global environmental degradation. Though some proponent’s of economic globalization assert the Kuznet’s curve flattens its environmental effects, this does not include CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions. Increase in production and consumption and easily induce further CO2 emissions, which subsequently results in global warming. There is “No evidence that Kuznet’s curve for CO2 ever turns down on its own.” [1]Global warming is a subsequent effect of CO2 [2], and it’s generally common knowledge -- being backed by empirical studies [3] CO2 emissions are generally and primarily caused by increased production, which is what economic globalization facilitates. If it increases production, the only logical consequence is then furthered global warming.Besides CO2 emissions, SO2 (sulfur oxide) emissions, which are pollutants [5], are another facet of considerable concern in regards to economic globalization. Yong S. Cho of Korea University explained in a study that there exists “a negative long-run relationship between SO2 emissions and income for developed countries…” [4] This clearly isn’t a positive consequence as there is less income. Even with SO2 emissions regressing, the effect on developing countries outweighs this slight benefit. The study continues, “while trade liberalization appears to increase environmental quality in developed economies, it has a detrimental effect on environmental quality in most developing countries.” Essentially, slight reduction in SO2 emissions in developed countries has little effect when weighed against *increased* emissions in developing countries and long-term lower income in developed nations.Aside from these two specific negative impacts, the total impact is negative, as indicated by studies. The foundation of this conclusion rests on one main point: the “race-to-the-bottom” theory, which will be addressed in further contentions. Because of this, the environmental degradation facilitated by economic globalization is both highly detrimental and irreversible.Labor Implications:The “race-to-the-bottom” theory is essentially constructed of the idea that “to the extent that countries are open to international trade and investment, environmental standards will be lower than they would otherwise be.” [6] Competition is a primary factor of economics and the standards by which corporations and countries lead their policies and practices. When competition becomes international rather than limited to nation-wide, companies lower labor standards to compensate for increased competition. Lowered labor standards facilitate and directly alter labor practices in a regressive manner.  [http://cdn.static-economist.com...] The graph above exemplifies the impact of lower labor standards on practices, and demonstrates the regressive trend over a period of 17 years. The graph is derived from an empirical time-series investigation study conducted by Ronald B. Davies of UCD School of Economics. [7] The study typifies these concerns: economic globalization has a net negative impact on labor practices and econometric spatial lag between the labor-rights index and actual labor practices. Lower labor standards allows unethical labor and wage abuse to employees, which could potentially apply to every working individual. This is a huge problem in regards to generating a net benefit. The Economist summarizes the findings as such: “If the labour standards across all other countries decline, those of the excepted country also tend to fall.” [9] These demonstrate the negative effects of economic globalization, and affirm the “race-to-the-bottom” theory.Moreover, the same conclusion can be applied to regulations in environmental protection, indicating due to increased competition, regulations would be lowered to lure polluting businesses to contribute to their GDP. These large companies would settle in areas with the least environmental prevention to their company. The same study from Harvard [6] explains, “by limiting trade and investment in some way, we might be able to attain a better environment for any given level of GDP.” This would negatively affect the environment as these companies would be permitted to release vast amounts of emissions known to contribute to global warming and general degradation of the environment. But beyond environmental attributes, labor practices and the facilitation of income inequality. Osvaldo Sunkel, professor of economics in Chile explains, “Since the [19]80s, when the new [globalization] policies have been implemented more or less all over the world, income distribution has worsened, both within countries and among countries.” [8] Income distribution is being degraded by economic globalization since the 1980s, and no evidence seem to suggest that trend will skew in favor of economic globalization. Indeed, Marc Bacchetta, economics research and statistics division of the World Trade Organization, furthers that globalization results in an “economy [that] is characterized by less job security, lower incomes, an absence of access to a range of social benefits and fewer possibilities to participate in formal education and training programmes – in short, the absence of key ingredients of decent work opportunities.” [10] Opportunities for “most” individuals to obtain “good” jobs are lacking, labor standards are degrading, and income inequality is rampant; all of these necessitate refraining from economic globalization.Conclusion:Due to large concerns in regards to the environment and the implications on labor, economic globalization does not generate a net benefit and certainly is not appealing or desirable.

    <t>1. Now if we do not accept economic globalization, it will only isolate our nation and limit out options. We have been doing economic globalization for years sense we invest money over seas and even have people that work for us companies over seas. To stop now would make it so we lose a lot of money.  2. Due to economic globalization nationapos;s economies increase, and more money flows into these nations. A lot of these nations need that money to try to being moderation programs in these nations. Some such nations that have benefited from it in such a way is china. After china opened it doors for economic trading chinaapos;s economy greatly increased and the nation started to become more modern because of it. Another nation that is also benefiting economically from globalization is India. Indiaapos;s economy had a strong growth rate until the global recession in 2008. But it is continuing to recover from  3. Due to trade deals witch is a result of economic globalization nations now have access to food they other wise wouldnapos;t have. For example you can now go to a market place and buy bananaapos;s from nations all the way in Africa. They helps both nations, because now that nation that sold the bananas will have more money going into there economy. The nation that bought them can now sell them to the people in that nation.  4. Also due to economic globalization companies are starting to open stores in third world nations that originally did not have them. This is a great thing for these nations, for these companies need people to fill in new jobs. So there are more workers now in the workplace, witch means more money is now going back into the economy. This will help the people there, and help aging bring the government closer to being a first world nation. These new jobs will help create a whole new marketplace in some cases and there business will boom. Here is a great example of this, aging I will use India. Due to globalization more IT, and technological jobs are opening up in India. This causes more to be in the work force, and aging benefit the nation by more money going into it.

    <t>Rebuttals1. Isolation if we donapos;t accept globalizationThis point is objectively false for a number of reasons:1. First of all, this is the black or white (false dilemma) fallacy. My opponent falsely asserts there is only two options: isolation, or accepting economic globalization. However, this is quite false, as there are other options, similar to the one for which I advocate.2. Per the definition, which my opponent did not attest or challenge (and thereby accepts), economic globalization is quot;The trans-national increase in trade and capital transfers across national boundaries.quot; [1] Increase, as denoted, is the key word here. Not accepting economic globalization doesnapos;t prohibit trade, it just doesnapos;t advocate for the rampant increase. 3. Thusly, a country isnapos;t by default isolated by nonacceptance of globalization. The claim that the countries would be much poorer is unfounded.2. More money flowHereapos;s a few responses:1. While money can flow in an easy manner, that doesnapos;t necessitate countries being richer. In fact, Iapos;ve shown how labor implications render this point false.2. My evidence points to the fact that income distribution has worsened. Job opportunities have failed because of this (my evidence also supports this) and subsequent poverty is not solved.3. In the end the flow of money =/= to a richer population, as the money can become transparent for the common people.3. Economic globalization and bananasA couple of responses here, as well:1. Trading, again, doesnapos;t require economic globalization. Before the term was even implicit of an increase in trading, trading existed.2. The rampant increase, as economic globalization would advocate, actually detriments the environment, as Iapos;ve demonstrated. This would logically destroy the environment in which bananas grow. How can we justifiably advocate for something that would harm banana trade? The argument here is turned: environmental impact of globalization destroys the banana assertion.4. OutsourcingI have some responses of clarification and argumentation:1. What my opponent is claiming here is not just globalization, itapos;s outsourcing. Yet, this doesnapos;t justify globalization for a few reasons as Iapos;ll mention.2. Outsourcing is harmful. While it is acclaimed to be good for individual business, it has unintended consequences, a few of which include the following: quot;[it] leads to fragmentation and disintegration of the supply chain, inviting new competitors into the industry. It also nurtures corporate complacency; and it undermines a company’s relations with its labor, customers, and the domestic and local communities.quot; [2] These harms can lead it to being a bad business strategy as well as bad for the individual.3. Outsourcing lowers quality. CBS News notes quot;Many firms that provide outsourcing quickly cut the quality of component parts in order to increase their margins.quot; [3] Desperation leads companies to cut down on quality to make more cash for their business itself.4. Outsourcing in regards to progress. Global research finds quot;Beginning in 2002 the US began running trade deficits in advanced technology products with Asia, Mexico and Ireland. As these countries are not leaders in advanced technology, the deficits obviously stem from US offshore manufacturing. In effect, the US is giving away its technology, which is rapidly being captured, while US firms reduce themselves to a brand name with a sales force.quot; [4] Instead of helping the outsourcing nation, it erodes their dominance. Moreover, labor standards and practices in these outsourced companies is despicable. [5] Itapos;s not progress for poverty alleviation and human rights activism when a consequence of globalization degrades labor practices as well as the labor laws themselves.Conclusion:Environmental concerns coupled with labor concerns should be sufficient to negating the resolution. However, accompanied by falsehoodapos;s that lie in the affirmative (economic impact isnapos;t there), there is no option but to negate.Sources:[1] http://tinyurl.com...[2] http://www.forbes.com...[3] http://www.cbsnews.com...[4] http://www.globalresearch.ca...[5] http://www.worldaffairs.org...</t>

Measuring climate over a short term has many variables; noisy factors. Hence, the resulting measurements do not have statistical significance.

Yet again, one has to look at the variables. In part, the results are reflective on how the ice caps were measured. Measurement of ice cap thickness is relatively new. Also, the results are again based on a short period of time; a single year.

    <t>Through analysis of ice cores, data has shown that prior to 1950, for 650,000 years, carbon dioxide levels have been below 300 parts per million. Since 1950 this level has sharply climbed to 400 parts per million. These numbers take into account solar cycles and earthquot;s rotational variations over time. Also, since 1880 the global surface temperatures have continued to rise. Ninety six cubic miles of ice sheets have been lost just between 2002 and 2005 alone.  Surface temperature increases and ice melts have also significantly affected the oceans. Cold water sinks from the arctic regions and circulates toward the equator where it rises and warms to return back to where it came pushed by winds and currents. This is what keeps the earthquot;s temperature rather temperate (within a specific range) in comparison to other planets. As temperatures rise and water warms this cycle slows, creating greater weather pattern fluctuations. Oceanic animals have become stressed due to the warming of habitat and desalination due to excess fresh water infusion. This is especially prevalent in coastal regions.  Together with the CO2 emissions due to fossil fuel use, additional methane is being released from melting permafrost in the arctic regions. As the permafrost melts methane produced from decaying organic matter increases, adding additional greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.  http://climate.nasa.gov... http://www.climatepath.org... http://www.piscoweb.org... https://news.yahoo.com...</t>

    <t>As I stated before, and as you mentioned the primary source of this claim is cited from quot;Cook et al. (2013).It is from quot;Cook et al.

This is the only category anyone claiming quot;X number of papers endorse Man Made Climate Change.quot; should reference, because this is the only category where that statement is true. “explicit endorsement without quantification”  are papers in which the author, by Cook’s admission, did not say whether .001 percent or 1 percent or 50 percent or 100 percent of the warming was caused by man. The crux of quot;explicit endorsement without quantificationquot; is that man has contributed SOME amount.Then there is quot;Implicit endorsementquot;, which quot;Implies humans are causing global warming. E.g., research assumes greenhouse gas emissions cause warming without explicitly stating humans are the causequot;.The important distinction here is that neither the “explicit endorsement without quantification”  or the quot;Implicit endorsementquot; make the claim that Human beings are the primary cause. However the theory of AGW([Anthropogenic, or human-cause, Global Warming) is that human being ARE the PRIMARY cause.However within his results he breaks down the summery of abstracts with AGW([Anthropogenic, or human-cause, Global Warming) position (%) as follows:Endorse AGW 97.1%Reject AGW 1.9%Uncertain on AGW 1.0%In formulating his result of quot;Endorse AGWquot;, Cook lumps together quot;Implicit endorsementquot; amp; “explicit endorsement without quantification”  with  “explicit endorsement with quantification”. Thus lumping together papers which suggest that human contribute some portion, with those stating that we are the primary cause.Further examination of Cooks data http://iopscience.iop.org... shows the truth of the matter: By his count, the number of articles classified into each category was:Level 1 = 64Level 2 = 922Level 3 = 2910Level 4 = 7970Level 5 = 54Level 6 = 15Level 7 = 9The 97% figure was the sum of levels 1-3. Assuming the count is correct—that 97% breaks down as:Level 1: 1.6%Level 2: 23%Level 3: 72%This shows only 1.6 percent explicitly stated that man-made greenhouse gases caused at least 50 percent of global warming.  Only Level 1 corresponds to quot;the Earth is warming up and human emissions of greenhouse gases are the main cause.quot; (emphasis mine) Hence when John Cook attributed that view to 97% on the basis of his Cook et. al. (2013) he was misrepresenting 1.6% as 97%. Adding up his categories 5-7, the levels of rejecting of AGW, we find that more papers explicitly or implicitly rejected the claim that human action was responsible for half or more of warming than accepted it. According to Cookapos;s own data. So no, Cook et. al. did not find that quot;over 97% endorsed the view that the Earth is warming up and human emissions of greenhouse gases are the main cause.quot;------------------------------------------------------Not only does Cookapos;s own data not prove the case, but much of cookapos;s data is improperly categorized. As Popular Technology investigated, http://www.populartechnology.net...Quoted from their interviews:quot;Dr. Scafetta, your paper apos;Phenomenological solar contribution to the 1900–2000 global surface warmingapos; is categorized by Cook et al. (2013) as; quot;Explicitly endorses and quantifies AGW as 50+%quot;Is this an accurate representation of your paper?Scafetta: quot;Cook et al. (2013) is based on a strawman argument because it does not correctly define the IPCC AGW theory, which is NOT that human emissions have contributed 50%+ of the global warming since 1900 but that almost 90-100% of the observed global warming was induced by human emission.What my papers say is that the IPCC view is erroneous because about 40-70% of the global warming observed from 1900 to 2000 was induced by the sun. This implies that the true climate sensitivity to CO2 doubling is likely around 1.5 C or less, and that the 21st century projections must be reduced by at least a factor of 2 or more. Of that the sun contributed (more or less) as much as the anthropogenic forcings.The quot;lessquot; claim is based on alternative solar models (e.g. ACRIM instead of PMOD) and also on the observation that part of the observed global warming might be due to urban heat island effect, and not to CO2.By using the 50% borderline a lot of so-called quot;skeptical worksquot; including some of mine are included in their 97%.quot;Any further comment on the Cook et al. (2013) paper? Scafetta: quot;Please note that it is very important to clarify that the AGW advocated by the IPCC has always claimed that 90-100% of the warming observed since 1900 is due to anthropogenic emissions. While critics like me have always claimed that the data would approximately indicate a 50-50 natural-anthropogenic contribution at most.What it is observed right now is utter dishonesty by the IPCC advocates. Instead of apologizing and honestly acknowledging that the AGW theory as advocated by the IPCC is wrong because based on climate models that poorly reconstruct the solar signature and do not reproduce the natural oscillations of the climate (AMO, PDO, NAO etc.) and honestly acknowledging that the truth, as it is emerging, is closer to what claimed by IPCC critics like me since 2005, these people are trying to get the credit.They are gradually engaging into a metamorphosis process to save face.Now they are misleadingly claiming that what they have always claimed was that AGW is quantified as 50+% of the total warming, so that once it will be clearer that AGW can only at most be quantified as 50% (without the quot;+quot;) of the total warming, they will still claim that they were sufficiently correct.And in this way they will get the credit that they do not merit, and continue in defaming critics like me that actually demonstrated such a fact since 2005/2006.quot;quot;</t>

Legates, Willie Soon, William M. Briggs, Christopher Monckton of BrenchleyAbstract: Agnotology is the study of how ignorance arises via circulation of misinformation calculated to mislead. Legates et al. (Sci Educ 22:2007–2017, 2013) had questioned the applicability of agnotology to politically-charged debates. In their reply, Bedford and Cook (Sci Educ 22:2019–2030, 2013), seeking to apply agnotology to climate science, asserted that fossil-fuel interests had promoted doubt about a climate consensus. Their definition of climate apos;misinformationapos; was contingent upon the post-modernist assumptions that scientific truth is discernible by measuring a consensus among experts, and that a near unanimous consensus exists. However, inspection of a claim by Cook et al. (Environ Res Lett 8:024024, 2013) of 97.1 % consensus, heavily relied upon by Bedford and Cook, shows just 0.3 % endorsement of the standard definition of consensus: that most warming since 1950 is anthropogenic. Agnotology, then, is a two-edged sword since either side in a debate may claim that general ignorance arises from misinformation allegedly circulated by the other. Significant questions about anthropogenic influences on climate remain. Therefore, Legates et al. appropriately asserted that partisan presentations of controversies stifle debate and have no place in education.Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the literature: A re-analysis(PDF) [Archive](Energy Policy, Volume 73, pp. 701-705, October 2014)- Richard S. J. TolAbstract: A claim has been that 97% of the scientific literature endorses anthropogenic climate change (Cook et al., 2013. Environ. Res. Lett. 8, 024024). This claim, frequently repeated in debates about climate policy, does not stand. A trend in composition is mistaken for a trend in endorsement. Reported results are inconsistent and biased. The sample is not representative and contains many irrelevant papers. Overall, data quality is low. Cookapos;s validation test shows that the data are invalid. Data disclosure is incomplete so that key results cannot be reproduced or tested.Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the literature: Rejoinder(PDF) [Archive](Energy Policy, Volume 73, pp. 709, October 2014)- Richard S. J. TolAbstract: In my critique of Cook et al. (2013), I raised a number of issues (Tol, 2014). Cook et al. (2014) respond to a few only. They do not dispute(1) that their sample is not representative,(2) that data quality is low,(3) that their validation test is not passed,(4) that they mistake a trend in composition for a trend in endorsement,(5) that the majority of the investigated papers that take a position on (anthropogenic) climate change in fact do not examine any evidence, and(6) that there are inexplicable patterns in the data.Comment on apos;Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literatureapos; (PDF) [Archive](Environmental Research Letters, Volume 10, Number 3, March 2015)- Benjamin John Floyd DeanAbstract: I read the study by Cook et al with great interest [1]. The study used levels of endorsement of global warming as outlined in their table 2; however, I could see no mention as to how these levels were created and how reliable they were in terms of both inter-rater and intra-rater reliability (Cohenapos;s kappa). Best practice on rater reliability indicates that both inter-rater and intra-rater should have been measured and documented in a study such as Dr Cookapos;s [2] and I am surprised that this fact appears to have been neglected. It would be of considerable benefit to readers for some robust rate reliability metrics to be included, if at all possible.</t>

    <t>Kind regards, no, I donapos;t forfeit rounds, Iapos;m just a little busy at the moment due to University. Final Round:First of all I would like to address my previous statement regarding the FAO report. While it most certainly provides evidence, it also is contradicted by many different sources. However, if my statement is read again, it clearly states that apos;theyapos;, and not it, is to be trusted, meaning the other reports or apparent evidence used by apos;Cowspiracyapos;. As for Proapos;s statement that quot;Again you assert wri.org is more trust worthy without proving it. Basically Con is stating that the World resource institute WRI is more reputable than the FAO Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.quot;, no, that is not what I am saying. Also, if you want to play the apos;prove gameapos;, prove that your sources are trustworthy. That will bring us nowhere. The point to be addressed is that the FAO report, while the full report is seemingly not accessible, parts of it are, includes many sources of data potentially unrelated to to factory farming, such as deforestation and cropping. quot;Meat industry sources object to the methodology used in the UN report, notably that deforestation for livestock was included in the calculations. These sources point out that pasture-grass-feeding, such as is common in New Zealand, may lead to lower emissions attributable to livestock, despite the fact that methane and nitrous oxide from livestock make up half of New Zealandapos;s greenhouse gas emissions.quot; (wikipedia) (http://maxa.maf.govt.nz...)As well as above, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (quoted from Wikipedia) found quot;In 2006, emissions sources contained within the Agricultural Chapters were responsible for emissions of … 6 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.quot; (currently being around 9%, as stated in round one, but unchallenged by Pro) (http://www3.epa.gov...). This, as stated in round one, is evidence for the U.S., a country with, as stated in the previous round, 99% animals being raised under apos;factory farmingapos; setting. This would mean that the U.S. could be taken as an example, meaning that, as in the U.S.apos;s case, factory farming being 99% of farming, yet only producing 9% of Greenhouse gases, which, by the way, is less than the U.S.apos;s transport emission, that factory farming by no means is the number one cause of man made global climate change. Besides, I would like to point to round one, where factory farming was clearly defined, with no objection of Pro, as quot;a system of rearing livestock using highly intensive methods, by which poultry, pigs, or cattle are confined indoors under strictly controlled conditions.quot;. This means that all of Proapos;s attempt to define all farming as apos;factory farmingapos; are non applicable. Otherwise we could define cattle, such as raised in Australia or huge parts of South America, which by all means can go wherever they want to on properties which are thousands of square kilometres large, as factory farming, because they are still under human control when mustered or apos;belongapos; to humans.. Absolute nonsense. Factory farming is, as stated in round one already, animals being raised indoors, normally in small pens, in an attempt to decrease labour input and maximise output. Also, according to Pro, as the burning of the Amazon rainforest apparently should be counted as apos;factory farmingapos;, practices such as slash and burn clearing of land for plantations are apparently factory farming as well. It is also to note that Pro has not submitted any facts supporting their thesis that apos;factory farmingapos; is the number one cause of man-made global climate change, other than the 18% number, that farming, as factory farming has not even been implicated, other than in the weak reasoning of an attempt to make all farming practices, seemingly plant production included, into factory farming. Conclusion:While Pro has neither provided a valid definition of apos;Factory Farmingapos;, nor actually provided any evidence that factory farming actually is the number 1 cause of man made global climate change, Con has provided evidence against this. apos;The most important factor in this debate is that Pro did not provide a link between the only evidence between the only applicable source used, the FAO report of 2006, which states that livestock creates 18% of Greenhouse gasses, however, Pro does not provide what amount of these 18% is actually apos;Factory Farmedapos;. This means, that possibly the number of Greenhouse gases produced by non factory farmed animals, remembering that factory farming, as stated in round 2, makes up around 40% of livestock numbers. Using logical reasoning, this would mean that non factory farmed animals produce more Greenhouse gases than factory farmed ones by sheer number, also taking into consideration that in a free range farming environment more resources become wasted when compared to factory farming, possibly creating more emissions. Furthermore it needs to be considered that according to many other sources, as supplied by Con, agriculture does, potentially, make up 18% of emissions as the FAO report includes some controversial factors. Proapos;s inclusion of the Amazon rainforest example cannot be seen as evidence, as in no way does the Greenpeace source provided, as bias as it is, provide a link to apos;factory farmingapos;. In fact, all the images Greenpeace has provided display animals freely roaming smoke filled ground resulting in slash and burn, hardly being factory farming, other than some images of animals being drafted, which, once again, is a result of the opposite of factory farming. Factory Farmed animals do not have to be drafted and mustered. The source Pro provided about 51% of emissions created by livestock was already rebutted in round 2 and the comments, as the authors of the source are incapable of conducting simple mathematical calculations. Thus, finally, as Pro has not provided any convincing evidence, or in fact any evidence at all, that factory farming is the number one source of man made global climate change, I, Con, will have to remain with my conclusion posted in round one, that Factory Farming is not the number one cause of man made global climate change.

    <t>Kind Regards for you arguments. Also, I always back up my argument, otherwise it would be opinion and not a proper argument.Rebuttals and arguments:First and foremost I would like to refer to what I wrote in the comments, previous to Pro posting their statement. This was that the sources of apos;Cowspiracyapos;, mainly the FAO report, as well as basically all sources of the apos;reportapos;, cannot be trusted as they are, in no way, academic or trustworthy. As such I will simply quote myself, as to what I said in the comments:quot;I have studied agriculture, I know what effect agriculture has on the environment very well. However, the majority of agricultural problems arising are not simply from apos;factory farmingapos;. (And with that I mean environmental, not solely emission wise)But as for their sources, hereapos;s the list: http://www.cowspiracy.com......I will analyse their sources on Greenhouse gases from top to bottom:1.) I cannot access this source. Having read up on it, it is also stated as bias.2.) Same again3.) Not scientific. Also, the authors canapos;t calculate, discrediting them even more. According to them, 7516 million metric tons of CO2e are produced by agriculture (animals) per year, being 11.8% (while previously stating 18%) of the worlds total. They then calculate this up to 32000 million, saying that it is 50%. That would be correct if it was 11.8%, making 100% around 64000 million, however, the world total, as stated here (http://www.wri.org...... a source which I trust way more) is 42/46000 million tons CO2e. That means 32000 million is in no way 50%... 18% makes a number around that 100%, meaning the authors canapos;t even do simple maths..4.) The rest is quite unrelated to the topic.quot;Furthermore it is to note that Pro has not made a clear link between apos;Factory Farmingapos; and climate change, but only between Farming and Climate change. However, apos;factory farmingapos; makes up under 50% (around 40%) of animal related agriculture, and evidence suggests that non factory farmed animals produce more emission than apos;factory farmedapos; animals, meaning that even they would have a higher emission than apos;factory farmingapos;. It is furthermore to state that the graph provided in round 1 is for the U.S, and it is to mention that the U.S. has one of the highest apos;factory farmingapos; sectors, with around 99% of agricultural animals held in the U.S. being held in apos;factory farmingapos; setting (https://www.aspca.org...). This would mean that, looking at above graph, factory farming most definitely is not the primary cause of man made global climate change. Proapos;s sources regarding greenpeace and the amazon rainforest can be disregarded, as they are not linked to factory farming. Conclusion:This means that none of Proapos;s sources can be seen as evidence that Factory Farming is the number one cause of man made global climate change. Kind Regards, I am looking forward to the next round.</t>

I also like it that you didnapos;t rely upon bare assertions and that you used outside sources to back up your claims.  quot;According to a 2006 report by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), animal agriculture is responsible for 18 percent of all human-induced greenhouse gas emissions, including 37 percent of methane emissions and 65 percent of nitrous oxide emissions.quot; Should Factory-Farmed Foods Be Labeled?

    <t>Kind regards for this debate. I will be representing the Con side, meaning that I will be debating that Factory Farming is not the number 1 cause of man made climate change. First I would like to define apos;factory farmingapos;, being defined as quot;a system of rearing livestock using highly intensive methods, by which poultry, pigs, or cattle are confined indoors under strictly controlled conditions.quot;apos;Man madeapos; implies that quot;made or caused by human beings (as opposed to occurring or being made naturally).quot; This means that the burning of fossil fuels, while it could occur naturally, occurs apos;man madeapos; as the method by which fossil fuels are creating climate change and are by all means man made, as to say that a majority of emissions would not occur, was it not for the human action of burning fossil fuels, thus implying a man made action and resulting in man made climate change.Opening Statement:First I would like to refer to to the World Resources Instituteapos;s data (http://www.wri.org...) showing that the US is one of the highest contributors to emissions. That being said, I will provide the following graph easily showing the little impact farming, not to mention this includes all practices of farming, not just apos;factory farmingapos;, has on the overall emissions. This graph is provided by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. (http://www3.epa.gov...)Easy to see, Agriculture has a minimal input of 9% on Greenhouse Gas emissions. Furthermore it is to mention, that according to the source used above, methane, the gas produced by animals, may make up an estimated 30% of emmissions in the Agricultural sector, however, thus only around 3% overall. And this is not even factory farming, just animals in total. Conclusion:As provided by statistics above, Agriculture itself is not even a major contribution to Greenhouse gas emissions, meaning that factory farming, which is an even smaller contributor, is not the number one cause of man made global climate change.

    <t>Look at figure 5 in source 1. It clearly shows a massive spike in temperature right after the Little Ice Age. It would be easy to dismiss - except that, if you look closely, you see the temperature trending slightly DOWNWARDS before the Industrial Revolution started. Would we live in a much colder present without the Industrial Revolutionapos;s negative climatic effects? Itapos;s hard to deny the data, and itapos;s even more of a stretch to say that thereapos;s no correlation with the IR.  As you said, carbon levels are rising. You attribute this to volcanoes. Yet volcanoes only produce about 1% of the carbon produced by fossil fuel burning (2). Even if the rate of volcanic eruptions quintupled, this would still not explain the dramatic rise in atmospheric carbon. You also state that climate change is part of some quot;natural cycle.quot; Yet contrary to your beliefs (and, Iapos;ll admit, some of my idle thoughts, until I read this article), climate change is definitely not part of the same cycle as the Ice Ages (3). For one thing, itapos;s not happening during the correct alignment of Earthapos;s axis; while weapos;re definitely in a warm period, the temperature should be FALLING, not rising, since the peak of the warm period was a few thousand years ago. Even if climate change WAS caused by the Sun, the troposphere is getting warmer while the stratosphere and -spheres above cool, a fingerprint of greenhouse gas warming. The Sun would be heating all layers equally. That leaves volcanic and oceanic greenhouse gas releases as the only possible candidates - yet they are both tiny climate change contributors, as I explained earlier, and - get this - they actually release a different carbon isotope mix with a different molecular makeup. The oceanic and volcanic carbon has a lower ratio of carbon-12 to carbon-13 - so how do you explain that the ratio has been rising steadily?  Lastly, you cited the Medieval Warm Period as evidence that the Earth goes through natural cycles of warming and cooling. Look at the map of the MWP warming pattern in source 4, and compare it to the map of todayapos;s manmade climate change. They look - ahem - a little bit different. The only part of the Earth that really saw significant warming during the MWP was Viking territory, and a larger part of the Earth actually got cooler. The lower map, of todayapos;s carbon, is like a goldfish thatapos;s been beaten to death - red with purple spots - and shows a much more uniform warming pattern.

    <t>You seem to be misunderstanding the question. Neither the question nor I ever said humans were quot;THE causequot; of climate change, but they are far and away the most destructive and sudden cause. Look at Graph 1. If, as you said, humans had no effect on climate change, how do you explain that extreme anomaly? While it certainly began at the peak of an Ice Age temperature/carbon cycle, the real production did not start until much later, and, as the graph shows, half the rise has been produced SINCE 1950. You ask me to explain how the climate spiked in the past - the answer is that it was a natural cycle, as you said. I NEVER claimed that all historical climate change was caused by humans. But this is an anomaly. Look at Source 2: Climate change now is 50 to 100 times faster than at any point in the past 65 million years. The biggest mistake climate skeptics make is to say that man-made climate change goes at anything like the pace of natural climate change: It does not. Itapos;s faster, so muchly-much faster that itapos;s unattributable to volcanoes and oceans. Skeptics tend to say that atmospheric temperature canapos;t rise as fast as scientists say it can, since the atmosphere is big, but it can. My point is that this is a different kind of cycle, far beyond anything since the dinosaurs went extinct.  I already explained how this cycle is different, actually. Look at my Source 4. Warming is more balanced in natural cycles. During the Ice Ages, Africa was heating up while Europe was being covered in ice. The planet can regulate its own temperature, but not in extreme circumstances, which weapos;ve now created. So the entire Earth is warming. Nothing has gotten colder, except once every twelve months when all the deniers come out of their houses and say their opinion is valid because thereapos;s snow on the ground. This change is fundamentally different from all before it.

Climate: the average course or condition of the weather at a place usually over a period of years as exhibited by temperature, wind velocity, and precipitationHumans do indeed play a role in climate change, but they do not explicitly apos;causeapos; climate change. Between the years of 900 and 1250, parts of the earth experienced a wide spread warming (Medieval Warm Period). This was before the existence of the Industrial Revolution, the invention of cars, and the widespread use of fossil fuels. Following this warm period, there was a cooling period. Millions of years ago, before humans roamed around, earthapos;s climate had a drastic change. Carbon levels rose, and the earth heated up. A good number of organisms died. Itapos;s interesting to note that in both of these cases, humans were either completely absent or in a much lesser number than now. And yet, somehow, the earth was still warming up. Yes, carbon levels are rising. Yes, the earth has warmed up a bit within the past 50 years. Yes, the sea levels have risen. But can we really blame humans and human activity? Climate change does happen, but to say that it is apos;causedapos; by human activity is quite a stretch.Even though the steady rise in carbon levels and sea levels can be loosely matched with the Industrial Revolution and the rise of humans, this is in no way definitive proof that humans cause climate change. Science has shown us many examples of climate change that did not directly involve humans.Itapos;s also important to understand that volcanoes have much to do with carbon levels and climate change. Itapos;s also interesting to note that many scientists believe that volcanic activity has had a slight increase over the past 50-60 years.http://www.merriam-webster.com...http://www.merriam-webster.com...https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov...</t>

If humans were quot;the causequot; of climate change, as you stated, all the past spikes in temperature would be marked by human activity, which, in fact, is not the case.As I said before, there could possibly be a correlation with the IR and the steady rise in temperatures. But is that enough to claim that humans are the cause? The issue under debate is not that humans play a significant part in climate change, itapos;s that humans are the cause of climate change. Volcanoes and oceanic emissions make up a very small percentage when it comes to carbon emission, but the numbers are still there.How did the volcanic CO2 emissions measure up 300 years ago? 200 years ago? 100 years ago? Climate change has been a very long and drawn out event. It is not an overnight change. Volcano eruptions in the past did outweigh the emissions made by humans. Humans began producing and thriving at a much greater level, and now, human emissions outweigh volcanic eruptions. So how can we attest climate change to humans when hundreds of years ago (when the climate was still rising) volcanic activity outweighed human emissions? If humans cause climate change, please explain why the climate spiked in the past, even when humans were hardly making a significant impact on CO2 levels in the atmosphere.</t>

    <t>The spikes in temperature are not that much of an anomly when compared to climates in the past. And the entire earth is not warming. According to NASA, the ice in Antarctica is really building up, and thereapos;s actually more ice there than before[1]. Now why would that happen if the quot;entire earthquot; was warming up? It seems to me that the Earth is regulating itself. At one end of the globe, things are heating up, but in the Antarctic, things are getting even cooler. I see where you are coming from, however I have to respectfully disagree. Itapos;s also interesting to note that whenever the earth gets warmer, scientists immediately jump to climate change and global warming. When the earth gets cooler, somehow, itapos;s still considered to be global warming.[1] http://www.theguardian.com...</t>

    <t>Humans do cause climate change. Though natural amounts of carbon in the atmosphere vary from 180 to 300ppm, today the level is at 400ppm - higher than in the past 800,000 years (1). Would the opposition suggest that this is a fluke? In addition, the sea level has risen around 220 mm in just 135 years, neatly coinciding with the Industrial Revolution and the corresponding increase in greenhouse gases (2). These two pieces of evidence, I believe, are enough to demonstrate that climate change does happen and is caused by human activity.  1: https://www.edf.org... 2: http://climate.nasa.gov...</t>

    <t>This is a debate about whether or not global warming is real. The premise is that global warming is real, and I am taking the Pro position - that is, I am arguing that global warming is real.  I, as Pro, will have the burden of proof in this debate. Since my opponent will be taking the Con position, it is not up to my opponent to prove that global warming is not real. Rather, it is up to me to prove that it is real. I will have the responsibility of making the arguments. My opponent will not have any responsibility or obligation to make arguments. However, if my opponent chooses to make arguments, thatapos;s OK. The only obligation that my opponent has is to debunk my arguments. I can debunk my opponentapos;s arguments if they choose to make any, but my primary goal will to be to make my own arguments. The burden of proof is on me. Also, this is not a debate about whether anthropogenic global warming is real. Itapos;s a debate about whether global warming is real. If I prove that global warming is real and that it is primarily or totally anthropogenic, then I will have succeeded. If I prove that it is real but also prove that it is not anthropogenic, then I will have also succeeded. If I prove that it is real but I donapos;t prove what causes it, then I will have also succeeded. Keep this in mind if you accept the debate.  Now, letapos;s define global warming. The definition that my opponent and I will use in this debate is quot;the overall increase of the average temperature of the planet Earthquot;, not quot;the Earth getting warmer all the time, everywherequot;.

If my opponent is acknowledging that global warming is real, which they seem to be doing, then it would appear that they are arguing for my side. Even if global warming is much slower than the models predicted and doesnapos;t have consequences that are as bad as some people say, then that does nothing to advance my opponentapos;s argument. Remember, this debate is solely about whether global warming is real - not about whether it will have terrible consequences or about how slow or fast it is.  And now, to make my own argument. Global warming is a fact. The global mean land-ocean temperature is much higher than it was in 1880, and overall, the trend has been that it has been increasing since then. It does decrease at times, which is inevitable. Temperatures rise and fall. But overall, the trend is that the global mean land-ocean temperature is increasing. The same can be said for the global temperature. Both of these can be verified by going to data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs_v3/.  I welcome my opponent to respond to my arguments.</t>

    <t>I will enumerate more of my opponents graphs.Figure 12: Global Glacier Cumulative Volume ChangesFigure 13: Proportions of growing and shrinking glaciers in 2009Figure 14: Sea Levels since 1870Figure 15: US Stations reporting continuously from 1900 to 2000Figure 16: Feedbacks vs Forcings GraphPart 6: Contradictory Glacial, Sea Level, and Temperature DataFigure 12 is interesting not because it counters any of my argument, but because it puts my opponents temperature, and sea level data in contradiction with it. If you look at 1970 in Figure 12 Youapos;ll notice the volume of glacial ice is higher than any point from 1870 to 1970. How did we get more Ice in 1970? If we accept that the melt of glaciers is caused solely by heat, and if we accept ether Figure 2, or the corrected Figure 6 then we have a problem. The dates leading up to 1970 donapos;t show any noticeable decline in temperature that would explain it, and the Figure 14 sea levels donapos;t show any stabilizing or drop in sea level to address where this extra water for the ice even came from.Weapos;re locked into another contradiction similar to the one that I started with. Ether the Glacial data is correct, and temperature, and sea level is incorrect. The Inverse of that, or both are wrong.There are a couple of issues with Figure 12 that will need to be disclosed and accounted for before we can con to a decision about which data is correct. According to my opponentapos;s source the number of glaciers represented from 1946 on back is in the single digits. Itapos;s not until about 1960 that we have about 30 glaciers represented in the sample. If we take a look at Figure 10 we can see that this is the point where the yearly median drops below zero implying slightly colder than average temperatures.If you look at Figure 12 at 1980 youapos;ll notice the angle of decrease shows a slowing which would imply that the temperature decreased, or had a slower accent than in prior years. In Figures 2, and 6 no such indication is given, but in Figure 10 the early 80apos;s shows another decline in temperatures before the 90apos;s where it finally moves above zero implying higher than normal temperatures, and thus a steeper decline in volume.In other words Figure 12 is in less contradiction with Figure 11 then it is with Figures 2, 6, and 14.However, Figure 12 also suffers from exaggeration of features due to changing sample size. This is address in my analysis in step 4, and when I brought up the causes of the differences between Figure 7 and Figure 8. Adding in a thousand weather stations radically altered the graph which is why step 4 restricted weather stations to existing at the start and end of the analysis. So where does the sampling look like for Glaciers? My opponentapos;s source is very nice to graph it out for us to see on their intermediate discussion of glacial ice.Figure 17: Number of observed glaciersAs you can see just prior to 1976 there was only about 45 glaciers in the data. Then it spontaneously has about 20, nearly half of the prior sample, added in. This continues until the early 80apos;s where that with a sample of just over 90 has doubled the sample. Then throw out the 90apos;s regular sampling increased, and this would further exaggerate the changes because we hasnapos;t sampled the glaciers in that method in the past.Now Iapos;d love to download the generate the data properly myself. My opponents source does point people towards it here: wgms.ch/data_databaseversions/ However the data isnapos;t high quality like the GHCN dataset, and would require more time than I have in this debate to properly process. It also doesnapos;t have what I would consider a high enough quantity of data. It barely has 30 glaciers sampled regularly, and Iapos;d personally prefer 100 before I started making definitive claims about what the data says. Even the source claims that they have 228 glaciers in the data, and the only way for that to work with the sample graph is if glaciers skip years, and arenapos;t fully represented every year, and across every season in a year.Part 7: Hiatus Proof?My opponent is under the mistaken belief that Iapos;ve proven the hiatus to be false. Unfortunately Part 1 of my argument does everything, but that. Iapos;ve proven only that two parts of the global warming argument about the hiatus are in stark contradiction with each other. That only proves one, or both are wrong. Unfortunately it doesnapos;t prove which one is actually wrong. Parts 2, 3, and 4 are the evidence that undermines Figures 2, and 6 strongly suggesting that data in both cases is flawed. Itapos;s up you the judges to choose which you believe. However, using my opponentapos;s reasoning that “because more recent updates are and should be seen as more trustworthy” is counter to logic, reason, and debate. It is an appeal to the authority of newness, and not a rational reason at all.Part 8: Correlation vs CausationMy opponent seems to be under the impression that my only focuses on the temperatures, and doesnapos;t refute humans as the cause. There is a phrase in statistics that you may have heard. “Correlation does not imply causation”, but thatapos;s only half the phrase. These other half is, “There is no causation without correlation”. Simply put if there is no correlation between global warming and human activity as Figure 10 shows then humans are certainly not the cause. However, if you believe Figure 2, or 6, and that they correlate to human CO2 activity then there is the additional burden of proving that the correlation causal, and not just correlational.Itapos;s an unfortunate asymmetry in statistical arguments. There is a possibility that even if there isnapos;t a correlation that maybe the correlation is just smaller than can be measured with the available data, but that would yield that human activity is an insignificant factor in global warming.As for correlation issues my opponent has another problem. If we believe Figure 14 weapos;d expect out CO2 emissions to map over it, and show a visible correlation. Now both CO2, and Ocean levels have gone up over time, but just going up isnapos;t enough. Sea levels have a nice smooth mathematical curve built into it. Iapos;d have loved to have put both the CO2 and Figure 14 together, but my opponents source linking to the data to do that leads to a 404 error:http://www.pol.ac.uk...Figure 18: CO2 EmissionsIf you notice between 1950 and 200 there is a bulge in out CO2 emissions, and between 1980 and 2000 a different rate of increase until 2000 where it is in line with an exponential trend that started in 1870. These features would be expected in the Sea Levels data if they were strongly correlated, but it looks like by the seal levels that itapos;s an exponential trend that never varies in the way out CO2 emissions do. My data is courtesy of Source 8. Now if my opponent can find the source for this Figure Iapos;d be happy to merge the sea level in so we can see just how much it doesnapos;t correlate. Most other sources only give about 10 years of data.Part 9: Solar ActivityMy opponent is under the impression that he can wave his hands, and assert an argument, and data is null just because it doesnapos;t conform to his world view. Heapos;d have to explain the lack of movement in the past data, and give an appropriate alternative for Cycle 24 correlating, but not prior. NASAapos;s assessment in 2008 on the effect of Solar Storms due to this unprecedented phenomenon had no prior data. Outside of the last decade this was never observed before. Claiming that we should see all layers heat up as he claims to try to ‘nullifyapos; is nothing more than an unsupported assumption.Part 10: Dust BowlMy opponent makes the claim that I hadnapos;t explained the downward change in the median, and then attempted to assert that it must be from a change in methodology. Though Iapos;m not against this possibility claiming that a change in any of the graphs is due to a methodology change requires further explanation. Parts 2, 3, and 4 are extensive explanation of methodological errors. However, I did explain the change in the graph even if it was indirect. In the 1930apos;s there was a excessive drought, and heat waves. Part of this being clearly represented in the data is due to the United States having the best most consistent weather station data for the last century, and even more so in my opponentapos;s Figure 15 because it is only the United States of America 600 weather stations vs my sample of 1170 weather stations. Now this event very much did occur, and is verified in the EPA Heat Wave Index that shows the 30apos;s were exceedingly bad even by todayapos;s standards, and you can read source 5 to see further analysis on this Great Depression causing event if you doubt the 30apos;s heat waves werenapos;t hell on Earth.Now why the 30apos;s was Hell on Earth is anybodyapos;s guess. We know it was bad, and man made CO2 emissions were even lower so blaming them enters into contradiction with the present high emissions. Personally Iapos;d love it if there was enough pan evaporation data to verify that there was, or was not a correlation with sunspots, but the available GHCN data is too small for that period evaporation data.Part 11: Contention 4My opponents 4th contention appears to be missing an actual argument to go with it, or even a time period to show the change in forcing, and feedbacks over time. Perhaps he will clarify in the next round what he was going after with it.Part 12: Earth, Mars, and VenusIapos;m out of time, and characters so I will have to cut my response a bit, and hope to come back to this part if possible.I await my opponent.[8] http://cdiac.ornl.gov...</t>

    <t>Resolved: Human Activity Is a Significant Factor in Global Warming on Planet Earth.I donapos;t intend on reposting any of my opponents graphs, or data. However it is important that I enumerate his graphs.Figure 1: Atmospheric CO2 for 650,000 yearsFigure 2: Global Land-Ocean Temperature IndexFigure 3: Greenhouse ExplanationFigure 4: Average Monthly Arctic Sea Ice August 1979 to 2013Figure 5: Sea Level ChangePart 1: DoubtItapos;s telling that my opponent makes the claim that it is irrefutable, and then uses Figure 2. Even NASA, and NOAA would refute that graph since in June of this year they published serious corrections in an attempt to remove the hiatus from the argument.Figure 6: Corrected Figure 2Now this claim that the pause doesnapos;t exist poses a problem because a few years ago the claim was that the pause was caused by about 17 volcanoes back as little as 2014[2]. So which is it? Does the pause exist, and was caused by Volcanoes, or does the pause not exist, and was caused by weighting issues in the data? Any reasonable person should now have some doubt in the basic data claims of global warming for a basic contradiction.Part 2: Methodology BiasUnderstanding instrument, and methodology bias is needed to understand what was done in Figure 6, and understand if we should accept the graph at all.The data that is being corrected is the Ocean temperature measurements done by volunteer ships in the early half of the data. By itself this isnapos;t a problem. The ship data has a higher inaccuracy, but all the ship data would have similar errors, and when compared to the same methodology there wouldnapos;t be an issue. When you mix in other methodologies this error can become a big problem. What caused these differences isnapos;t hard to understand. Think of a time where we collected temperature data without the aid of a machine. If someone has to go out, and check the temperature, and record it there is always the possibility they missed the true high, and missed the true low. When we get to machine aided recording missing that true high, and true low is drastically reduced. Furthermore the error is unidirectional. Missing the true high will only result in a lower value. Just as missing the true low only results in a higher value.We can actually see this type of bias in weather station dataset call the GHCN Data: [3]If we didnapos;t accept the methodology bias Figure 7 would present an interesting problem since the average high increase about 4 degrees C, and the average Low decreases by about 6 degrees C. If that was global warming the decrease in the low would seriously outweigh the increase in the high.Figure 7: All GHCN High and Low Temperature Yearly AveragesPart 3: Addressing BiasTo address bias the bias must remain as constant as possible. Part of the reason for only debating the last 115 years is that the bias for weather station methodology hasnapos;t radically changed unlike in the seventeen, and eighteen hundreds where changes in methodology were much more common. By just comparing a station to itself, and only looking at the stations delta from hits own average we can show that the abrupt change around 1900 was actually an illusion caused by a large number of stations following a similar methodology, and not an actual change in temperature.We can see in Figure 8 that the change is more gradual like the low temperature in Figure 7. The disagreement between the two graphs implies that the change is due to method changes, and not due to real changes.Figure 8: All GHCN Station High Temperature Average DeltaFigure 9: All GHCN Station Low Temperature Average DeltaIt would be an error to accept either Figure 7 or 8 as the truth. Both still suffer from a change in methodology bias, but they reflect that change differently. They both also high the noise in the data by utilizing a yearly, and 5 year mean. However, if you do accept Figure 7 as the truth youapos;d still have to reconcile the issue that Figure 9 shows that the Low temperature being higher than our modern time.We also have an issue with sample size. At the earliest part of the data there is only 1 station. Itapos;s not until the 1870apos;s that we start to get a decent sample size to start to remove statistical sampling errors, but even then itapos;s only at a minimum. At the peak of the data in 2005 we have nearly 14 thousand station, but by 2015 we only have 10 thousand stations. This radical change in sample size can cause. Just as in 1893 we only had 563 stations but in 1894 we had 1353 which is responsible for the abrupt change in Figure 7.The methodology below is what I will use to address each of these issues.Methodology GHCN Data Analysis: 1. To process this data the first step is to convert each stations monthly 31 day values into a single monthly median value for each station.2. Then each stations monthly median values are averages to create the average median for the life of the station.3. The station average median is then subtracted from the station median to create a delta that represents that stations change away from the average median.4. Stations are then selected based on the date of operation. For analysis starting in 1900 all weather stations that were operational in 1900 and operational at the end of the analysis must be used. Weather stations that were not operational at the start of the analysis cannot be used because they will induce a change in the region bias.5. From there the data can be graphed, or each months delta for the year can be averaged to create a yearly change for a simpler graph.Part 4: GHCN Data AnalysisFigure 10 below is the above analysis applied to the Global Historical Climatology Network Data. The blue dots represent the monthly noise that Figure 2, and 6 hides. We can now see that the average temperature varies by +- 4 degrees from normal, and not the few tenths of a degree that the yearly mean implies. As a note the two largest positive deviations from the mean are March 2010, and 2012 by 6.1, and 6.6 degrees respectively. They are separated by nearly a century, and show that the high temperatures of 2012 are hardly abnormal.If you notice in the graph between 1930, and 1940 youapos;ll notice a clear bulge in the 5 year mean about zero. This is of note because it correlates with the known heat waves of the 30apos;s that attributed to an climaxed with the Dust Bowl in 1936 as seen in the EPA Heat Wave Index[5]. Anyone looking at this data in the 50apos;s and 60apos;s might actually believe that we were heading towards a global cooling event since in the 70apos;s the median clearly drops below zero. Conversely anyone starting their analysis in the 70apos;s is starting at a low, and thus only see a movement upwards. Which may also explain my opponentapos;s Figures 4 and 5 which start with the low 70apos;s era, and lack any data for the early half of the 115 year period this debate is over.We can even apply a trend line to see if there is a trend upwards over the time period. There is a slight trend of 0.0009 degrees celsius per year, but this is with an R Squared of 0.0004 which means the significance of that upward trend is almost nothing, and canapos;t be used for any real future predictions. For those unfamiliar with R Squared we really want to see a value as close to 1 as possible. A value of 0.5 is ok for some things like predicting erratic human behavior, but the more significant the claim the closer to 1 it needs to be. 0.0004 is so close to zero that it may as well be zero.Figure 10: GHCN High Monthly Average Delta 1900 - 2015Iapos;d present A figure on the Low, but it would be redundant with Figure 10, and given the time and text constraints I will cut it from my argument.Part 5: Is Temperature the Appropriate Measure?When we say that CO2 causes the Earthapos;s temperature to rise what we really mean is that the increase in CO2 causes the atmosphere to hold more energy. The Pan Evaporation Rate can be used to measure the energy in the atmosphere. If you take a look at Figure 11 youapos;ll notice it significantly deviates from a rather consistent trend. Iapos;ve reduced the time range to 1980 to 2015 to give the largest possible sample of 156 pans in the GHCN dataset.Figure 11: Pan Evaporation to Sun SpotsIf we accept the increase is due to an abnormal warming due to solar storms that track with sun spots then we have a problem from the lack of any significant change during the man made ramp up of CO2 over the last 3, and a half decades. Since the sunapos;s solar output varies by about 0.1 percent[6] it could be that even adding more CO2 has little effect because weapos;ve long since been able to absorb nearly all of the available solar energy.So why is there a spontaneous increase after 2005? In 2008 NASA announced a discovery of an odd phenomena. They observed a Northern polarity Coronal Mass Ejection rip open our Northern Magnetic pole, and thus exposed the entire day side of the planet to solar storms that it doesnapos;t normally get[7]. This resulted in the prediction that solar cycle 24 which would send more northern polarity CMEapos;s towards the Earth would, and subject us to an unusually high volume of Solar Storms that our Magnetic field usually protects us from. This would also explain why the shape with many of the same peaks and valleys visible in the data.[1] https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov...[2] http://time.com...[3] ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/[4] https://en.wikipedia.org...

    <t>Thanks to my opponent, itapos;s been fun.I will respond to the points my opponent has made in this round, and clarify my case.But first of all, I am sure that I hadnapos;t ignored a piece of my opponentapos;s case. Donapos;t trust this claim as just because a response is brief doesnapos;t mean itapos;s not valid.==Rebuttal 1: 1970 has more ice than 1870==My opponent is correct that the data is cumulative. However, he drops my response to this when I stated that there was an apparent but brief drop in temperature caused by sulphate aerosols. I donapos;t agree with how my opponent states I must drop the evidence simply because his basis is that there was an increase in ice for 20 years (even though the line starts dropping rapidly). If we were to apply a trend line the line would most definitely be slanted downwards towards the right. His argument doesnapos;t explain the rest of the graph showing sharp declines in ice. I find that my opponent nitpicks at every little flaw that doesnapos;t seem right even though the rest supports my argument, and he ends up dropping the rest of the graph altogether.I think what my opponent focuses the most on, however, is how figures are exaggerated as more and more climate stations are set up, and he attempts to apply that to temperature record figures. However, the notion that temperature record figures are untrustworthy is false, as has been shown throughout the debate [1]:quot;For example, a study by Anderson et al. (2012) created a new global surface temperature record reconstruction using 173 records with some type of physical or biological link toglobal surface temperatures (corals, ice cores, speleothems, lake and ocean sediments, and historical documents).  The study compared their reconstruction to the instrumental temperature record and found a strong correlation between the two[.]quot; - Skeptical Science [1]==Rebuttal 2: No correlation==This point as a large relation with the first point, and doesnapos;t affect much in the debate. Basically my opponent states that we canapos;t trust graphs that start in the 70apos;s because it was a low point in global warming. There are two points to make:(A) Again, my opponent doesnapos;t focus on the rest of the graphs with clearly agree with my case in the debate.(B) The only figures I gave which started in the 70apos;s are the ones I had replaced with other data.Again, this point is null because it has little to no weight in this debate.==Rebuttal 3: Pan Evaporation==My opponent drops my response to this argument, where I gave the two statements that (a) we cannot use the method because no sources or figures measuring temperature correlate with pan evaporation, and (b) global warming is found to be affected by human causes the most, as shown in the last round.After doing some research, I found that pan evaporation did have to do with climate, but not with global warming. This extends the point of my rebuttal [2]:quot;Pan evaporation is a measurement that combines or integrates the effects of several climate elements: temperature, humidity, rain fall, drought dispersion, solar radiation, and wind. Evaporation is greatest on hot, windy, dry, sunny days; and is greatly reduced when clouds block the sun and when air is cool, calm, and humid. Pan evaporation measurements enable farmers and ranchers to understand how much water their crops will need.quot; - Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopediia [2]Wikipedia states that pan evaporation helps farmers and ranchers to correctly water their crops. But never does it say anything about energy in the atmosphere.==Counter 1: Sea Levels==My opponent seems to make a valid point about the glaical and ice contradiction, but it isnapos;t valid. Glaciers hold less than 2% of the water on Earth [3]:quot;The amount of water locked up in ice and snow is only about 1.7 percent of all water on Earth[.]quot; - Textile Waste Diversion Inc. [3]Glaciers were just a part of my argument to show that ice was melting. The fact that glaciers hold so little of the worldapos;s water barely makes any difference in the rise in sea levels, especially since most glaciers exist inland, but not near the oceans, as most glaciers are of the Himalayas, which are inland [4][5]: quot;The Himalayan–Karakoram (HK) region has among the largest glacier coverage outside the polar regions[.]quot; - Estimating the volume of glaciers in the Himalayan–Karakoram region using different methods [5]This alone means that glaciers can be used as evidence for global warming, but NOT to disprove its existence. My opponentapos;s rebuttal is null.==Counter 2: Mixed Methodologies==This, again, is an example of the nitpicking my opponent has done throughout the debate. Correlation =/= imitation. But if my opponent still canapos;t accept my graph, here are the reasons why my opponentapos;s rebuttal isnapos;t coherent:1. My opponent emphasized a lot on the heat waves of the 30apos;s, so the fact that heapos;s using that to try and prove there isnapos;t a correlation is beyond me.2. Where the temperature drops out (more so not) of the correlation is so insignificant that it may as well be part of the correlation. Somehow my opponent thinks that a difference in correlation about a millimeter or less for a graph THAT size still counts as proof that the correlation is false.==Counter 3: Other planets==quot;When we burn Coal we actually end up taking O2 out of the air, and put in CO2.quot; - OpponentMy opponent now suddenly agrees that CO2 has a heating effect, which is different from the last few contentions. But if this is untrue, see my previous counter.My opponent also agrees that we are still adding CO2 to the atmosphere, even though oxygen is being taken out of the air. Itapos;s basically a concession of this point because my opponent agrees the atmosphere on Venus is thick with greenhous gases. P1) More CO2 in the atmosphere = Earth heats upP2) We are putting more CO2 into the atmosphereC) We are heating up Earth.As for the electromagnetic field, my opponent ignores that Mercury does not have a major electromagnetic field either [6].quot;Mercury’s magnetic field is 150 times weaker than that of our planet, however.quot; - Phys.org [6] And with a distance much smaller from the sun than other planets, youapos;d expect that Mercury would be hotter. However, BECAUSE Venus has such an atmosphere it is simply that much hotter.==Dropped arguments==My opponent drops many arguments in the debate, which is lucky because they seem to be important points.He drops the points:- That natural causes have a much smaller heating effect than with human effects- That positive feedbacks amplify heating effects- That the increase in glaciers is probably due to the brief drops in temperature that were only temporary and caused by humans as well- That methodology changes donapos;t change the actual temperature- That we canapos;t use pan evaporation because it is not relevant to the debate- That temperatures are perfectly fine evidence in terms of this debate- That the corrections made in NASAapos;s graph do not make much difference- That newer sources are usually more trustworthy, especially when made by a government websiteThose are the ones that I can think of at the top of my head, and there could be more. Donapos;t let my opponent respond to them because it is unfair if he responds when I canapos;t.==Conclusion== There are huge holes in my opponentapos;s argument, as well as big contradictions. Their arguments are more like theories (or even just hypotheses) because they nitpick at things if something isnapos;t perfect. And my opponent can throw any theory he wants at me but scientific research somehow, as tylergraham said, always seems to fly in his face.The resolution is soundly affirmed.==Sources==[1] http://www.skepticalscience.com...[2] https://en.wikipedia.org...[3] http://textilewastediversion.com...[4] http://oi52.tinypic.com...[5] http://www.the-cryosphere.net...[6] http://phys.org...Final round to con!</t>

    <t>Itapos;s unfortunate that my opponent decided to write up his response to the contradiction in his data so rashly. Perhaps if he had taken a day to digest the argument he would have been able to come up with a better response.Since this is a long debate Iapos;m going to use this round as a tldr to summarize the evidence, and give my opponent one last chance to attempt to refute the challenges heapos;s chosen to ignore, or breeze past.EvidenceNot Human Caused1) 1970 has more ice than 1870My opponent seems to be unable to read his own graph, Figure 12. According to his own data, which he did not decide to toss out, the Sum total of Ice loss in 1970 was between -300 and -400, and in 1870 itapos;s clearly more than -400. Because itapos;s going with a communalative total this means there was an increase in Ice.Now I gave my opponent, and you the judges lots of leeway to reject the evidence completely. However, he has not, and misunderstands what I was talking about with the change in the number of sampled glaciers. When you add in a large amount of sample like in Figure 7 when the number of Weather Stations goes from about 500 to over a thousand the graph becomes exaggerated. According to Figure 17 thatapos;s exactly what happened with the glacier data around 1976 where the sampling nearly double.2) Weather Station data shows no correlation change with human activity in the 115 year range of this debate.This is simply a fact that canapos;t actually be refuted. The truth is that when you do a comparative analysis for weather stations that use the complete set. In other words. they exist at the start, 1900, and exist at the end 2015 you get no noticeable correlation with an increase in temperature. My opponent was even nice enough to find a second source confirming this with a smaller more restrictive dataset.So, why would you want to include a bunch of weather stations from 1970 that have no records going back to 1900 when you want to know what changes in weather can be observed from 1900 to 2015?The answer is simple. Figure 10 shows 1970 as a low point in temperature, and, if Figure 12 is not discarded, is corroborated by the ice data. The several thousand stations added thought the 70apos;s can only show an increase because they started at the bottom, and have no past beyond that, like the high of the 30apos;s, to be compared to. It results in the increase being exaggerated, in much the same way Figure 12 has exaggerations.3) The Pan Evaporation Rate is by far the most important fassett of this debate.The fact that this rate stays relatively constant from 1980 to 2005 corroborates the conclusions drawn from Figure 10. The fact that it changes in late 2010 to strongly correlate to solar cycle 24 which NASA has predicted in 2008 would subject the Earth to an unusually large volume of Solar Storms because of an effect with our Electromagnetic field suggest some important things. Most importantly that is shows changes in the Earthapos;s Energy footprint, and second that the changes that it shows has nothing to do with the actions of man. So if we blame the heat waves of 2012, and the record heat of 2014 on global warming the real culprit is solar storms made possible by a weird effect in our electromagnetic field, and a dual peak, 2012 and 2014, in solar cycles 24.Man Caused Evidence1) Sea LevelsOn the surface it may seem that sea levels support my opponent. However, this requires that he reject his own glacial data. After all if the Volume of Ice is high in 1970 than it was in 1870 where did this ice come from? Then without the dataset to recreate the graph we canapos;t reliably show the CO2 and Sea Levels side by side to see how well or not well they correlate. In my view the bulge of CO2 from the 70apos;s isnapos;t visible the poor quality graph of the Sea Levels, and the source for that dataset has long since taken it down, or moved it. Itapos;s even possible that sea levels, and the Ice Data are both correct, but that would require believing something like our pumping of groundwater could have had an impact on the amount of available water, but thatapos;s not global warming if you accept that.2) Mixed Methodology Temperature GraphsA good portion of my argument involves a bit of education about how mixed methodologies can warp a graph. The easiest way to resolve this kind of an argument is to separate out the methodologies, and treat each of them separately. Iapos;ve done this with the weather station data.Now his latest temperature graph does attempt at showing a correlation between CO2, and temperature. However, if we accept the Round 3 temperature graph there are a few problem. First Iapos;m glad my opponent finally has a graph that shows a clear run up in temperature for the 30apos;s unlike his others. However, this exposes that the correlation only exists for about 1960 to 2000 maybe 2015 since itapos;s hard to tell on the edge of a graph if the trend is continuing, or not. In his graph the temperature is noticeably higher compared to the CO2 levels breaking the correlation for the 30apos;s, 40apos;s, and 50apos;s. Then in the early 1900apos;s itapos;s noticeably lower breaking the correlation yet again. Finally in the 1880apos;s itapos;s noticeably higher than the CO2 would imply. If CO2 so definitively correlates for a brief period in the 20apos;s and from 1960 to present why does it deviate so violently in the other periods? It could be that the CO2 measurements in that graph are an over smoothed representation of the truth, or it could be that the correlation never really was to begin with.3) VenusThis is actually a minor point, but Iapos;m aware that some people will look at the example of Earth, Mars, and Venus, and think that it is somehow proof.Fact, even if we burned all the Coal, and Oil on the planet, and even if we were in the orbit of Venus we still wouldnapos;t even approach the temperatures of Venus. The reason has to do with Atmospheric pressure and Ideal Gases. CO2 and O2 are close enough to Ideal Gases that they actually obey the Ideal Gas Laws.When we burn Coal we actually end up taking O2 out of the air, and put in CO2. Now we just need to apply Avogadroapos;s Law.Avogadroapos;s Law“equal volumes of all gases, at the same temperature and pressure, have the same number of molecules”This means that the atmospheric pressure will remain the same at 1 Bar for Earth, but Venus has 92 Bars of pressure, or 9200%. No amount of burning will cause us to add atmosphere. We can only convert it. Now volcanoes can inject CO2 without burning, and thatapos;s one of the few ways it can be approached. However, even with the same exact atmosphere weapos;d still be colder because when our electromagnetic field is working we donapos;t get the additional heat that Venus does because it spins too slowly to have a field large enough to deflect them.This is why the Venus, and Mars analogy is false. It is a gross over simplification of the truth. It neglects that we donapos;t add atmosphere, but rather convert it. It also ignores out electromagnetic field which is the main difference between Earth and Venus, and Mars.Thank you, and I await our final round.</t>

    <t>Thank you, medv4380.   ==Contention 1: The correlation between increase in Carbon Dioxide and global temperature==  Throughout the last 650,000 years, there have been seven cycles of glacial advances and retreats, where the carbon dioxide levels abruptly increased, then gradually decreased afterward. However, in 1950, Co2 levels were at a critical level and kept on rising. As of 2014, the global Co2 levels were at an all time high of nearly 400 parts per million [1]:    2 has increased since the Industrial Revolution. (Source: [[LINK     As we can see above, in the last 650,000 years, the Co2 levels have never grown above 300 ppm, as opposed to now, where the Co2 levels are at 400 ppm. Obviously, this abrupt growth in Co2 levels are caused by human activity, such as mass production, the use of electricity, polluting, etc.  I have provided a youtube video above to show the correlation between the high Co2 levels and global temperature [2]. When both are compared, this becomes irrefutable evidence that man-made global warming exists. Note that this is all over the world, so accusations of choosing a specific area for evidence cannot be valid.  In fact, as of 2013, the average global temperature was 14.6 degrees Celsius (58.3 degrees Fahrenheit), which is 0.8 degrees Celsius (1.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than when the year was 1880, and 0.6 degrees Celsius (1.1 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the mid-20th century baseline [3][4][5]:    Already, on the first contention, we have seen major evidence affirming the resolution.  ==Contention 2: The cause and effect of the Greenhouse Effect and what makes it more powerful==  The greenhouse effect on Planet Earth has been occurring for almost its whole life and is a natural phenomenon, since greenhouse gases such as Co2 have existed on Earth from its birth, thus heating the Earth to help sustain forms of life [6]:  quot;To its credit, the greenhouse effect has been around long before humans began to burn fossil fuels, and it is a natural phenomenon in that makes life habitable for all living things.quot; [6]  The greenhouse effect operates when the sunapos;s heat passes through Earthapos;s atmosphere, heats the Earthapos;s surface and is reflected back upward. Most of this heat is absorbed by the greenhouse gases like water vapor, Co2 and methane. Afterward, the heat is re-emited in all directions, thus starting the cycle again, continuously heating the Earth. Greenhouse gases literally act like a thermal blanket for Earth [7]:  of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide – act as a thermal blanket for the Earth, absorbing heat and warming the surface to a life-supporting average of 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius).quot; /gt;  quot;A layer of greenhouse gases - primarily water vapor, and including much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide - act as a thermal blanket for the Earth, absorbing heat and warming the surface to a life-supporting average of 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius).quot; [7]  From this information, we can conclude that the more greenhouse gases are put into the atmosphere, the more heat from the sun is absorbed, thus creating a powerful greenhouse effect. Human actvity is causing this to happen.  P1) The more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the more powerful the greenhouse effectP2) Human activity is emitting more greenhouse gases into the atmosphereC) Human activity is the cause of a more powerful greenhouse effect, and thus man-made global warming exists.  To further prove this point, let us inspect Earthapos;s neighboring planets, Mars and Venus.  Marsapos; atmosphere is quite thin, and itapos;s nearly completely made up of Co2. However, it is because of the low atmospheric pressure and lack of other greenhouse gases that the greenhouse effect is not at all strong and thus Mars has a frozen surface without any signs of organisms [7].  quot;Not enough greenhouse effect: The planet Mars has a very thin atmosphere, nearly all carbon dioxide. Because of the low atmospheric pressure, and with little to no methane or water vapor to reinforce the weak greenhouse effect, Mars has a largely frozen surface that shows no evidence of life.quot; [7]  Now, let us inspect Venus.  Despite Venusapos; atmosphere also being almost entirely carbon dioxide, the amount of Co2 Venus contains is about 300 times as much as Marsapos; or Earthapos;s. This creates a HUGELY powerful greenhouse effect, causing a temperature so high that lead could not stay solid. [7]  quot;Too much greenhouse effect: The atmosphere of Venus, like Mars, is nearly all carbon dioxide. But Venus has about 300 times as much carbon dioxide in its atmosphere as Earth and Mars do, producing a runaway greenhouse effect and a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead.quot; [7]  This can be further proven by checking Mercuryapos;s temperature compared to Venusapos; temperature, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun than Venus. [8]   quot;Venus has a very dense atmosphere made up of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and sulfuric acid, while Mercury has a very thin atmosphere with various gases, but very little carbon dioxide.quot; [8]  Again this information is major evidence of the existence of man-made global warming.  ==Contention 3: Arctic Ice and Sea Levels==  It is widely agreed that melting ice from the Arctic and Antarctic and sea level rise is a sign of increasing temperatures. If I can prove that ice is definitely decreasing and that sea levels are definitely rising, then I win this contention.  Here is a chart showing definite decrease in Arctic ice [9]:    Here is another chart showing rising sea levels [10]:    Also, recent reports state that the Arctic is losing ice three times as fast as the Antarctic is gaining ice [11][12].   quot;Sea ice surrounding Antarctica reached a new record high extent this year, covering more of the southern oceans than it has since scientists began a long-term satellite record to map sea ice extent in the late 1970s. The upward trend in the Antarctic, however, is only about a third of the magnitude of the rapid loss of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean.quot;  Thus, I affirm this contention.  ==Conclusion==  I have put forward major evidence and arguments proving the existence of man-made global warming. I have also put out evidence that the greenhouse effect does indeed exist.  Thus, the resolution is affirmed.  ==Sources==  [1] http://climate.nasa.gov............;[2] https://www.youtube.com............;[3] http://climate.nasa.gov............;[4] http://climate.nasa.gov............;[5] http://data.giss.nasa.gov............;[6] http://earthguide.ucsd.edu............;[7] http://climate.nasa.gov............;[8] http://scienceline.ucsb.edu......[9] http://www.forbes.com......[10] http://www.nasa.gov......[11] http://www.nasa.gov......[12] https://www.youtube.com......</t>

    <t>Thanks to my opponent! Reading their arguments I can see this will be a great debate! Iapos;d like to remind my opponent that although this is a rebuttal round, per the rules, new arguments can still be made.Also, there was a problem with my sources in the previous round. I will present them again:[1] http://climate.nasa.gov...[2] https://www.youtube.com...[3] http://climate.nasa.gov...[4] http://climate.nasa.gov...[5] http://data.giss.nasa.gov...[6] http://earthguide.ucsd.edu...[7] http://climate.nasa.gov...[8] http://scienceline.ucsb.edu...[9] http://www.forbes.com...[10] http://www.nasa.gov...[11] http://www.nasa.gov...[12] https://www.youtube.com...Rebuttals==Rebuttal 1: To doubt =/= To refute==My opponentapos;s first argument poses a few flaws. First of all, the new figure that has been presented has *barely changed* looking at the more recent years of the graph. Also, the change at the start of the graph is a difference of what seems to be less than 0.2 degrees Celcius, which doesnapos;t even change the fact that the warming is significant. But that isnapos;t the point. The point is the question of what to trust. quot;Now this claim that the pause doesnapos;t exist poses a problem because a few years ago the claim was that the pause was caused by about 17 volcanoes back as little as 2014. So which is it? Does the pause exist, and was caused by Volcanoes, or does the pause not exist, and was caused by weighting issues in the data? Any reasonable person should now have some doubt in the basic data claims of global warming for a basic contradiction.quot; - My opponentWhile I can agree that this may pose doubt, I can also ask the audience to *turn* this argument, because more recent updates are and should be seen as more trustworthy, no matter how close they are. Therefore, my opponentapos;s argument here only proves that there was no hiatus and the doubt should be cast on the 2014 update.Finally, I will stress this as much as I can: *This doesnapos;t refute the notion that humans are a significant cause of global warming, because so far it only focuses on temperatures instead of causation.*==Rebuttal 2: Methodology Bias==There is no doubt that methodologies change throughout the course of time, as we advance with new technology. However, shouldnapos;t it be safer to trust more modern methods rather than outdated ones? A lot of my opponentapos;s part 2, 3 and 4 arguments are based solely off the fact that methodologies change, rather than addressing the fact that new methodologies can be used to update old figures, as was done with NASAapos;s figure.Another version of figure 6 in my opponentapos;s round can be seen here [1]:s://www.ncdc.noaa.gov...; alt=quot;Graph showing no slow down in global warmingquot; /gt;What really matters is what my opponent says about his GHCN analysis of the high monthly average delta graph. He claims that the cooling period might explain why figures 4 and 5 start at a certain point. But there wasnapos;t any major increase trend in ice even before the 70apos;s [2]:quot;Globally glaciers are losing ice at an extensive rate (Figure 1). There are still situations in which glaciers gain or lose ice more than typical for one region or another but the long term trends are all the same, and about 90% of glaciers are shrinking worldwide (Figure 2).quot; - Skeptical Science [2]Sea levels have also been rising since the 1800apos;s [3]:quot;A variety of different measurements find steadily rising sea levels over the past century.quot; - Skeptical Science [3] The most important part is where my opponent claims that the trend is almost nothing and canapos;t be used for future predictions. This graph closely resembles the one found here [4]:This figure was created from the actual temperature rise graphs from choosing the most actively reporting stations.  Unfortunately, my opponent never gives a reason as to why there was a cooling in 1945 - 1970. The reason to this is actually one of my opponentapos;s arguments: methodologies changed right at that time. This would imply that graphed temperatures rapidly changed, and in this case, dropped. [5]Not only that, but the cooling was actually due to sulphate aerosols being released into the atmosphere [5]. Sulphate aerosols reflect solar energy back into space. This was not only caused by humans releasing such aerosols, but also by volcanic eruptions [5]. The greenhouse effect would start dominating climate again in the 70s, and the rapid warming has continued until today [5]. Therefore, rather than arguing we are not a cause of either, we should be discussing that we are the cause of both, and that the cooling was just a temporary decline.==Rebuttal 3: Is The Cause Solar Output?==The crux of my opponentapos;s argument here is that pan evaporation correlates more with solar activity, and that the sudden increase would be because of a rip in the Northern Pole, weaking the Earthapos;s magnetic field. We both agree that the sunapos;s activity has remained quite constant in recent history. However, if the sudden warming were due to this rip, we can logically conclude that the atmosphere would be warmer within all layers as would happen with a situation where the sun actually increased in activity [6]. However, we have actually seen quot;a cooling in the upper atmosphere, and a warming at the surface and in the lower parts of the atmosphere. Thatapos;s because greenhouse gasses are trapping heat in the lower atmosphere.quot; - NASA [6]Therefore, my opponentapos;s arguments are null.New contentions ==Contention 4: Positive feedbacks strengthen forcings==Forcings are factors that quot;forcequot; climate to change. Feedbacks are factors that amplify or diminish the effect of forcings. Because positive feedbacks dominate climate, the effect of forcings are significantly amplified [7]:==Conclusion==The evidence I have put out proves my opponentapos;s arguments null and even contradicting as some of his data does not consider other factors. Therefore, so far a conclusion can be made that human effects do play a big part in global warming.==Sources==[1] https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov...[2] http://www.skepticalscience.com...[3] http://www.skepticalscience.com...[4] http://wattsupwiththat.com...[5] https://www.skepticalscience.com...[6] http://climate.nasa.gov...[7] http://www.nasa.gov...To Con!</t>

    <t>Thanks to my opponent for such a great debate!Counter-rebuttals==Counter 1: Contradiction?==My opponent asserts that my glacial, sea level and temperature figures are contradictory. He never considers the fact that there were sudden but brief drops in temperature near to the increase in ice, which both his and my figures agree upon.I donapos;t agree with the way my opponent presents why the amount of ice on Earth is increasing. More glaciers =/= more ice. Simply because there are more glaciers being observed doesnapos;t mean the *amount* of ice is increasing. Donapos;t count on trusting the use of his graph, because it is in a way irrelevant to what we are trying to discuss on this contention.==Counter 2: Hiatus==[Remember: The hiatus is said to have happened in more recent years, so more recent data can be cited.] Con tries to save his argument by stating that I made an appeal to authority to newness, and assumes that it is quot;not a rational reason at allquot;. So what is he implying here? Is he implying that we should trust older methodologies simply because I supposedly committed one logical fallacy that isnapos;t even that much of a negative effect? So far, thatapos;s the only basis he has for his argument, and the reason why we canapos;t accept his basis in this case is because it is simply common sense. In most, if not all debates, we are inclined to use the newest and most updated sources, thus more trustworthy sources. We shouldnapos;t try to attack the sources of others simply because it is quot;an appeal to the authority of newnessquot;, because it isnapos;t - itapos;s just common sense.Where his argument is relevant is interesting, because he seems to not know which one is right or wrong. Even so, the graphs would *still* support my argument. Con doesnapos;t even know if either of them ACTUALLY ARE right or wrong. And with the huge consensus and observed evidence supporting it, the answer leans way towards the Pro stance [1-3]: ==Counter 3: Correlation vs. Causation==Here my opponent essentially nitpicks the slightest flaws in correlation and claims these flaws are deciding factors. First of all, there isnapos;t even supposed to be a direct correlation between CO2 and sea levels - they are FAR from correlating to each other. The CO2 is emitted, then temperature rises, then ice melts, THEN sea levels rise. You canapos;t expect a perfect correlation when they are that far away from each other. Secondly, why must it correlate so perfectly? If they correlate and they are reasonably close, then what does it matter?==Counter 4: Solar Activity==I am shocked that my opponent has assumed that I made an unsupported assumption, *when it is undeniably clear I made a citation supporting my argument.* Let me repeat that. Clearly.And why would we need data from prior to the alleged increase when this is simply logic and facts? The reasoning I had given *perfectly* fits with the scenario being discussed. But if my opponent still isnapos;t happy about that, then Iapos;ll explain why it is still null. The warming on Earth is known as global warming. Warming means steady temperature increase. Key word: temperature. So if temperature increasing means pan evapoation is increasing, then why is temperature almost universally agreed to be increasing yet there seems to be no trend in figure 11 for pan evaporation? Obviously this doesnapos;t make sense. So is that figure very trustworthy? The answer: probably not.Also, just to top it off, figures agree that the increase is solely due to human effects [4]: ==Counter 5: Dust Bowl==My opponent continues to not give me a valid reason for the decrease in the median. Of course, he did talk about the droughts and terrible heat waves, but since when did we find out that the aftermath of heat waves would be sudden and big cooling worldwide?And yes, Con did provide extensive explanations about methodological bias, but that wasnapos;t the only thing that caused figures to show a sudden cooling. The other thing was the fact that humans started to use more sulphate aerosols, which cool the Earth [5]. So Con has yet to come up with another reason for the decrease.==Counter 6: Feedbacks and forcings==I apologize for this contention - somehow it got cut out. I will not present the previous graphs, but rather build onto it.So far, we can conclude that positive feedbacks dominate climate and thus amplify the effect of forcings significantly. Climate sensitivity is essential in climate science - it is the rise of equilibrium global land-sea mean temperature each time CO2 concentration is doubled [6]. quot;It is defined simply as the global mean warming that is reached in equilibrium (that is, after a long time) after doubling the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.quot; - Anthropogenic Climate Change: Revisiting the facts [6]With feedbacks, climate sensitivity is about 3 degrees Celcius [7]:The increasing CO2 emissions are predominantly anthropogenic. Combine the forcings increase with the feedback amplification, and you get increasing temperature caused by humans.My opponent seems to not be able to respond to the planets contention, so I will allow them to respond in their next arguments.==Conclusion==Con fails to disprove the evidence I have put forward, making assumptions that are difficult, if not impossible to justify. Thus, I affirm.==Sources==[1] http://www.skepticalscience.com...[2] http://www.skepticalscience.com...[3] http://warmgloblog.blogspot.com...[4] http://www.alternet.org...[5] https://www.skepticalscience.com...[6] http://www.pik-potsdam.de...(p. 4) [7] http://www.skepticalscience.com...I await my opponentapos;s arguments!</t>

    <t>You the judges are presented with a problem. Whose statistics, whose figures should you believe?In order to help you Iapos;m going to tell you a short story paraphrased from Professor Helen M Walker that you can find in a book titled “How to lie with Statistics” by Darrell Huff published in 1954 starting on about page 62. If you wish to debate any statistic, or figure you might want to consider reading the book in full.As women get older they toe out more as they walk. It seems like an absurd conclusion, and indeed false, but it is something the data would say at the time. To reach this conclusion you simply survey a large sample of women, and plot their age and angle of their feet, and it would say that at the time. Women who were younger didnapos;t toe out as much as women who were older. However, it is wrong because itapos;s assuming the younger women are a valid reconstructed past of the older women. The issue is actually that the older women toed out more even when they were younger as well because it was a generational fad that faded over time with each generation. The correct way to do this analysis would be to take women born at around the same time like 1900, and measure them once each year over a period of time like 115 years. Only then would you be able to tell if women toe out more as they grow older.This highlights the major problem with global warming data. It assumes that adding in a large volume of weather stations at different periods of time that have no past to compare to wonapos;t cause any deviation in their data. It assumed that adding in data from volunteer ships for the first half of the century, but not the later half wouldnapos;t affect their data until adjusting it in a favorable way appeared to remove part of the argument.If we had no choice Iapos;d agree that this method is flawed, but there exists no alternative. However, we have a sufficiently large number of weather stations that have been in operation from 1900 to Present. But this basic analysis for checking to see if sampling bias, and methodology bias is the actual cause of the change is ignored. There exists no funding of additional projects that says there is no measurable change in temperature in the last 115 years. There is no renewal of tenure for the professor who can only publish once that there is nothing here on a subject, and then must find another controversy to publish on.As for the Hiatus, if you understand my argument at this point you should have a clue as to what it actually is. Over the years weapos;ve added so many weather stations that by the mid 90apos;s that ability to manipulate the data by adding more sample would require adding 5 to 10 thousand samples. Theyapos;d finally reached the point where the law of large numbers overwhelmed them, and adding a few hundred only accounted for a few percentage points to the total sample. The cost of adding non randomized weather station sample exceeded their desire.The evaporation data by itself is all that is needed to prove man is not a significant player in global warming. The rest is ether to confirm the finding like how stable evaporation had been prior to 2005, and 2010. Or to discredit, and confront the poor methods used to support my opponentapos;s argument.If the evaporation data couldnapos;t show changes in the Earthapos;s Atmospheric energy then it would remain flat regardless of any change in the environment. However, we know it does change, and changed with the predictions from NASA that the Earth would be subjected to more solar storms than we normally do for Solar Cycle 24 due to an unexpected effect in our electromagnetic field. The correlation is so pristine that it even has the same peaks and valleys. If it can change for that in such a fine tuned way then why doesnapos;t it so the change for man caused global warming? There are only two answers. Either man caused global warming is insignificant compared to the solar effect, and is drowned out by the subtle noise. Or that it is nonexistent. Ether conclusion fully supports my argument.Iapos;ve undermined, and instilled doubt into my opponentapos;s argument. That isnapos;t to get you to vote for me. That is only to give you a reason to listen so that I can give you the time of day. You will vote for me because you will have looked at the evaporation data Iapos;ve presented, and come to the same rational conclusion.Man Made Global Warming has nothing to do with the enhanced levels of energy in our atmosphere over the last decade, and is insignificant, or nonexistent compared to the natural cause: Solar Storms breaking through our Electromagnetic Field.Thank you for letting me give you the time of day.</t>

    <t>Contention 1: CO2 and Temperatures. First, letapos;s bring up just how much these accused compounds exactly warm the Earthapos;s atmosphere. CO2 for example has the global warming potential of 1. Here are the other numbers. Carbon Dioxide -- 1Methane -- 21Nitrous Oxide -- 298-310CFCapos;s -- VariousWater Vapor -- 0.25 [1]  Now, I just want you to keep this in mind for this next part here. We may observe that humans release approximately 35 gigatons of CO2 a year. [2] This is only 4.3% of the total amount of all Global Warming Gasses, however it is incrediably small when it comes to comparing the rest of the Global Warming gasses. If we observe the chart bellow we can see that Water Vapor is a large Contributor to Global Warming at 95% and CO2 comes in second. But hereapos;s the kicker. If we look at the Human contributed part that Iapos;m about to post in the graph bellow we can see that itapos;s very miniscule of 0.117% of all total Warming gasses. Now letapos;s do some quick math here. CO2apos;s increase was from what my opponent is claiming is from 295 ppm to 400ppm, a total of only 105 ppm. 1 Gigaton of CO2 is the equilivent of 2.13 ppm. [3] This means that increase of 105 ppm means a total of 49.29 gigatons. Since 1 gigaton of CO2 is the equivilance of .004% of the Greenhouse effect that means that 49.29 gigatons means an aditional .21% increase to Global Warming. This would account for a grand total of a 0.15 F increase in global temperature. This is a very measly amount and we can see that with my opponentapos;s claims a simple 0.15 F increase isnapos;t enough to melt glacers and have the effeccts that he is speaking of and it proves that this is NAUTRAL not man-made to fulfil his effects if they were real.     The above graph shows that comparisions of C13 (Carbon isotope) and this shows that there is little to no trend pertrade in many of these as the average is zero while the trend for all of these are zero. [4] This is important as the Carbon isotope is important in measuring this so called quot;Global Warming.quot;   Let us observe the above graph. Here I would like to point out the that the increase from Pre-Inustrial to Industrial era and the doubling of the CO2 leveling lead to a decrease in itapos;s temperature. Also we can see that the 10 mile quot;hot-spotquot; above the tropics is actually absent. quot;The computer models show that greenhouse warming will cause a hot-spot at an altitude between 8 and 12 km over the tropics between 30 N and 30 S. The temperature at this hot-spot is projected to increase at a rate of two to three times faster than at the surface. However, the Hadley Centreapos;s real-world plot of radiosonde temperature observations shown below does not show the projected CO2 induced global warming hot-spot at all. The predicted hot-spot is entirely absent from the observational record. This shows that atmosphere warming theory programmed into climate models are wrong.quot; [5]Now if we observe the above graph of the past 400,000 yeasrs we can see that the CO2 rates in our atmosphere has flutated the exact same way in this cycle both before and during the existance of human beings. We can see that the temperatures and CO2 levels have been going up and down randomly for the past 100 thousands years and it is observed that this occured before the industrial revolution. We can also see that right now we are in a warming period so that arguing that humans are because of this is post hoc. Not to mention that we are in the coldest of the warming periods in Earthapos;s history!We can see that once again despite contrary to belief we can see that though there may be warming the fact is simply that there is no human warming.  Contention 2: Earth is cooling.  If we observe the above graph we can see that Earth has been a whole lot hotter than where we currently are to the point where the Earthapos;s average temperature has been 7.5 degrees Celcuis hotter than it currently it is. You can also see that in the span of the past 10,000 years the temperature has leveld off, but you may ask yourself where does that place us in the lights of modern day?  I am going to site Dr. Done Easterbrook, who is a climate scientist. Back in 2000 he predicted that Earth was entering a cooling phase. He predicts that for the next 20 years Earth will cool by 3/10 degree each year and that we are going to enter another little Ice Age like we did from 1650 and 1790. (6) The funny thing is that many of my opponentapos;s charts are actually from the incorrect IPPC. How about the quot;Hockey Stickquot; graph that many Global Warming supporters , including my opponent, argue about? Well if we observe the fallowing chart taken from Northern Scandenavia we can see that the Global trend over the past 1,000 years that the Global Cooling trend slope is that of -0.31 Degrees Celcuis, give or take 0.03 degrees (for the error room). Professor Dr. Jan Esper has found that the Earthapos;s temperature of Earth actually decreases 0.3 per millenia due to the Earth moving away from the sun. (7)   Here is another graph from 1920 to 2005 and we can see that the graph has a negative temperature slope, thus meaning that the Earth is under a period of cooling. (8) You can see in terms of more Warming in the evidence in which Scientists use Ice Cores Earth has actually been Cooling the past Mellenium. You can see that in terms of Gasses contribution to the Green House Effect the major contributer is Water Vapor and itapos;s at 95% to CO2apos;s 3.6% and this is the overall contribution including man made and natural. When we look to the chart on the left we can see that Man-Made CO2 does have a higher contribution to the atmosphere than Water Vapor, but thatapos;s because we do not create much water vapor as humans. Even with this evidence we can see that CO2 does not have any effect what-so-ever compared to Water Vapor. (9) Where might those CFCs be on this graph you may ask. Why itapos;s under the Misc. gases section. Once again, we can see that the IPCC and Al Gore are inccorect as the hocky stick graph is a bust. As Iapos;ve shown in earlier rounds and they have been dropped in showing that the Earthapos;s temperature has indeed been way hotter then current and on an average basis at that. My opponent has also dropped my opening graph in C1 r2 That also showed that CO2 levels are at an all time low! Thus once again disproving my opponentapos;s theory.Here we can see that even though CO2 levels are increaseing that the temperature in recent years has actually decreased on the linear scale. Also, the US Senate Committe on Envirnment and public works also took a stab at this issue. They found that the Hocky Stick graph was also bogus in 2006. “Today’s NAS report reaffirms what I have been saying all along, that Mannapos;s ‘hockey stick’ is broken,”Senator Inhofe said.“Today’s report refutes Mannapos;s prior assertions that there was no Medieval Warm Period or Little Ice Age.” “This report shows that the planet warmed for about 200 years prior to the industrial age, when we were coming out of the depths of the Little Ice Age where harsh winters froze the Thames and caused untold deaths. “Trying to prove man-made global warming by comparing the well-known fact that todayapos;s temperatures are warmer than during the Little Ice Age is akin to comparing summer to winter to show a catastrophic temperature trend.” [10]Paleoclimate scientist Bob Carter had shown through his research at University of East Angila in the United Kingdom that the Climate Change increase had actually froze from 1998-2006 showing that this so called Global Warming had actually stopped.

    <t>C1) Positive feedbacks dominate climate  Carbon dioxide has a significant influence on global land-sea mean temperature. All scientists agree that CO2 has some direct effect, increasing temperature by 1.1 degrees Celsius per doubling of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. David Evans argues, “Most serious skeptical scientists have always agreed with the government climate scientists about the direct effect of CO2. The argument is entirely about the feedbacks.” [1]   Climate sensitivity is the key point in all of climate science. The term ‘climate sensitivity’ refers to -- in this context -- the rise in equilibrium global land-sea mean temperature per doubling of the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere [2]. A 2005 study by Nir Joseph Shaviv confirms that the climate sensitivity, without any amplification, is 1.1 degrees Celsius [3]. Most serious scientists agree. The argument, as Evans argues, is about the feedbacks.   What is a feedback? A feedback is a climate process that amplifies or dampens the effect of a climate forcing. A climate forcing is any factor that influences temperature increase, in this case referring to CO2. So, a feedback is anything that amplifies or dampens the effect of CO2 on climate. Feedbacks that amplify it are called positive feedbacks, while those that dampen it are negative ones [4]. I argue that positive feedbacks dominate climate, and therefore, increase the overall effect of CO2 on temperature.     Various studies report positive feedbacks as more likely. Soden and Held report a 2 degree celsius climate sensitivity due to positive feedbacks. The study reports very few negative feedbacks. “Water vapor is found to provide the largest positive feedback in all models and its strength is consistent with that expected from constant relative humidity changes in the water vapor mixing ratio. The feedbacks from clouds and surface albedo are also found to be positive in all models, while the only stabilizing (negative) feedback comes from the temperature response.” [5] A 2003 study by Colman reports a feedback of nearly 3 degrees celsius, and the paper is cited by Soden and Held. In the study, “[a] comparison is performed for water vapour, cloud, albedo and lapse rate feedbacks taken from published results of ‘offline’ feedback calculations for general circulation models (GCMs) with mixed layer oceans performing 2 x CO2 and solar perturbation experiments.” [6]  There is much evidence outside climate models as well. Wigley, et al.  report a possible sensitivity of greater than 4.5 degrees celsius due to volcanic forcings, and supports an average sensitivity of 3.5 degrees. The study says, “After the maximum cooling for low-latitude eruptions, the temperature relaxes back toward the initial state with an e-folding time of 29–43 months for sensitivities of 1–4 degrees C equilibrium warming for CO2 doubling.” [7] A 2005 study by Forster and Gregory also uses volcanic forcings and feedbacks, and finds a climate sensitivity range of 1 - 4.1 degrees Celsius [8].   Even in a hypothetical scenario where negative feedbacks cancel out positive feedbacks to a climate sensitivity of 1 degree C, research by Ziskin and Shaviv (2011) has predicted that “the largest contribution to the 20th century warming comes from anthropogenic sources.” [9] They find that of the ~0.7 degree C temperature rise in the 20th century (some estimates slightly higher), about 0.4 degrees of that are due to anthropogenic forgings, or about 57% of the warming.  Nonetheless, climate sensitivity is likely much higher than that. Research by Patrick Michaels, a CATO scholar, found that the amplifier was 1.6 degrees C [10]. This means that human activity causing global warming is much greater than 57%, even under these low estimates. I still maintain that sensitivity is somewhere around 2 - 3 degrees C. A study by leading climatologist JD Annan -- using the Bayesian statistical approach -- found a mean sensitivity of 3 degrees Celsius [11]. The following graph describes the consensus in the literature on climate sensitivity [12].     The following picture portrays the evidence regarding climate sensitivity.     As such, I conclude that the effect of the rise in CO2 on climate is huge.   C2) Evidence from paleoclimatology  The paleoclimatological record is clear that CO2 has become the chief climate forcing in the Cenozoic Era (which began after the Cretaceous mass-extinction event 65.5 million years ago). Overall, solar activity has increased by 40% in this period. James E. Hansen and Makiko Sato argue, “The sun’s brightness increased steadily through the Cenozoic, by about 0.4 percent according to solar physics models (Sackmann et al., 1993). Because Earth absorbs about 240 W/m^2 of solar energy, that brightness increase is a forcing of about 1 W/m^2 . This small linear increase of forcing, by itself, would have caused a modest global warming through the Cenozoic Era.” [13] It’s clear that “CO2 was the dominant forcing in the Cenozoic.” [13]   The temperature changes correspond to the changes in CO2 levels. Take the example of the Vostok ice cores. A study by French and Russian institutes says, “There is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr.” [14]  This graph shows the correlations between CO2 and temperature over the past 200,000 years.     There is proof that it is warmer now than since the Medieval Warm Period. In fact, it is warmer now than any year since 1400 [15]. Another study that replicated previous ‘hockey stick’ studies shows the following data [16].     Thus, paleoclimatology confirms that CO2 influences climate at huge levels.   C3) Human activity  I have now established that CO2 is responsible for much more that 57% of global warming, somewhere around 75%. Now, I must establish that humans are responsible for much of CO2 generation. First, a simple correlation -- CO2 levels rose with the beginning of industrial activity [17]. The following graph shows CO2 concentrations over the last 10,000 years.     If the ratio between C-14 and C-12 decline, the observation would virtually confirm that human activity is responsible for increase in CO2 concentration. This is because the CO2 emissions humans make come from fossil fuels [18]. This has been observed [19].   Thus, human activity has influenced CO2 decline and CO2 is a driving force of climate. Therefore, I affirm.   1. https://mises.org... 2. http://www.pik-potsdam.de... 3. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com... 4. http://www.ipcc.ch... 5. http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov... 6. http://link.springer.com... 7. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com... 8. http://homepages.see.leeds.ac.uk... 9. http://www.phys.huji.ac.il... 10. http://www.int-res.com... 11. http://www.jamstec.go.jp... 12. http://www.skepticalscience.com... 13. http://www.columbia.edu... 14. http://cdiac.ornl.gov... 15. http://www.atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca... 16. http://www.skepticalscience.com... 17. http://www.skepticalscience.com... 18. http://www.skepticalscience.com... 19. http://www.bgc.mpg.de...</t>

    <t>HOUSEKEEPING1. In my Round 2 argument, I mistakenly wrote, quot;I have now established that [human activity] is responsible for much more that 57% of global warming, somewhere around 75%.quot; I meant to write 65%, which is the actual number. That is an approximate estimate, and my estimate is closer to 62.5% of the warming (which means human activity has caused 85% of global warming since 1975, indicating a climate sensitivity of around 2 degrees C).2. Con writes, quot;My opponent has also dropped my opening graph in C1 r2 That also showed that CO2 levels are at an all time low! Thus once again disproving my opponentapos;s theory.quot; Note that I couldnapos;t have dropped anything, since this *is* Conapos;s C1, R2.  CONapos;s CASEOverviews1. Conapos;s first contention is a defense. It doesnapos;t give any offense, i.e. does not provide a reason for judges to vote for his side. Con argues that CO2 does not have an effect, which merely preempts an argument that asserts that CO2 does have an effect. I ask judges to take this into consideration. I will refute that argument anyway.  2. The second contention Con presents is a quot;kritikquot; of the topic. A quot;kritikquot; is defined as an argument that challenges an assumption in the resolution. The second contention says global warming doesnapos;t even exist, therefore is not man-made. Therefore, its topicality is indirect, making it a quot;kritik.quot; Rule 6 prohibits quot;kritiks.quot; Please note this violation. C1. Carbon Dioxide and TemperaturesCarbon dioxide does not exactly correlate with temperature. However, the radiative forcing of CO2 and the sun allows for a direct correlation. The sun drives much of modern climate change. The most recent spurt of global warming was caused by the sun, thus carbon dioxide drives climate change and is a major forcing. [1] The below graph illustrates a correlation between the forcings of the sun and CO2, and the rise in temperature. [2]  The effects of carbon dioxide increase due to positive feedback amplification. Feedbacks such as volcanic activity and clouds can significantly expand the impact of carbon dioxide on temperature. [3] The below graph depicts the correlation between carbon dioxide and temperatures over the last 700,000 years.A comparison of the warming between the troposphere and the stratosphere can demonstrate this. Majority of atmospheric carbon dioxide is found in the upper troposphere, entailing that carbon dioxide would cause higher temperatures in the troposphere than in the stratosphere. [4, 5] The following graph depicts the temperature effect of CO2 in the troposphere and stratosphere. [6] Robert Berner and Zavareth Kothavala argue, quot; The exact values of CO2...should not be taken literally...[O]ver the long term, there is indeed a correlation between CO2 and paleotemperature.quot; [7] The following graph shows the uncertainty of values of CO2. [8]Furthermore, I can turn the entire argument against Con. This is primarily because many of the greenhouse gases mentioned - with high global warming potentials - act as positive feedbacks. Water vapor, the greenhouse gas that has the highest effect on climate, as conceded by Con, also acts as the largest positive feedback. Brian J. Soden and Isaac M. Held write, quot;Water vapor is found to provide the largest positive feedback in all models and its strength is consistent with that expected from constant relative humidity changes in the water vapor mixing ratio. The feedbacks from clouds and surface albedo are also found to be positive in all models, while the only stabilizing (negative) feedback comes from the temperature response.quot; [9] This means the effects of water vapor help my case. A positive feedback loop would also allow CO2 level increase to cause an increase in the water vapor concentration in the atmosphere. quot;When CO2 is added to the atmosphere, as a greenhouse gas it has a warming effect. This causes more water to evaporate and warm the air more to a higher (more or less) stabilized level. So CO2 warming has an amplified effect, beyond a purely CO2 effect...Without any feedbacks, a doubling of CO2 would warm the globe around 1 degree C. Taken on its own, water vapour feedback roughly doubles the amount of CO2 warming. When other feedbacks are included (eg - loss of albedo due to melting ice), the total warming from a doubling of CO2 is around 3 degrees Celsius.quot; [10] This is affirmed by the research of Soden and Held, who find that water vapor is the primary atmospheric feedback on Earth. [11]C2. The Temperature of the EarthAll my opponents studies are faulty and unreliable. These are the reasons. Firstly, my opponentapos;s first graph shows the temperature of the Earth in relation to the temperature of the Earth millions of years ago. This can be discredited, because quot;global warmingquot; only began in the 19th century, after the Earth was relatively normal. The definition of global warming given in the debate concerns the 19th century. Discredit the first graph. Secondly, the idea of the quot;global warming hiatus,quot; which my opponent brings up, is flawed. My opponentapos;s data is largely based on TSS data. UAH and HADCRUT4 data both show that the Earth has been continuing to warm throughout the last 15 years. [12, 13] Further, the long-term trend of increasing temperatures is due to CO2. Short-term variability happens all the time; it does not mean that the long-term increase is going to stabilize forever. Oscillation phenomena, or quot;La Nenaquot; phenomena, will result in the trend changing, but will revert to a positive trend eventually. [14] Thirdly, the heat content of Earth is actually increasing. quot;This new research combines measurements of oceanheat, land and atmosphere warming and ice melting to find that our climate system continued to accumulate heatthrough to 2008...Since 1970, the Earthapos;s heat content has been rising at a rate of 6 x 10^21 Joules per year.quot; [15] The below graph represents this. [16] Also, quot;Foster and Rahmstorf (2011) used multiple linear regression to filter out the effects of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and solar and volcanic activity (Figure 2), and found that the underlying global surface and lower atmospherewarming trends have remained very steady in recent years.quot; [15] The below graph portrays the data. [17]Con then reiterates the argument from water vapor, which is addressed above. He then straw-mans my position, since I did not present the hockey stick graph.

    <t>I would like to thank my opponent for accepting this challenge.Iapos;d like to remind the audience, and my opponent, before we get to far on the definition of Global Warming, and clarify any ambiguity. The round 1 definition should be sufficient, but to clarify Global Warming is the changes to the environment caused by manmade pollution. Pollution would be excess CO2, SO2, and so on. My opponent did not object, or provide an alternative definition in round 1 so I assume he accepts the definition.I will be presenting a controversial view that Global Warming has not accelerated the water cycle. This will have actual analysis of weather station data from NOAA. It is a large dataset, and I am willing to show anyone who asks how to begin analysing it. The Evaporation data is small enough to analyse in excel, but precipitation data would require a database or custom tools to work with. Analysis Method:In order to estimate precipitation, and evaporation levels I will be utilizing the NOAA GHCND weather station dataset. If you wish to download and verify the dataset can be found here: ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/1. To process this data the first step is to convert each stations monthly 31 day values into a single monthly median value for each station.2. Then each stations monthly median values are averages to create the average median for the life of the station.3. The station average median is then subtracted from the station median to create a delta that represents that stations change away from the average median.4. Stations are then selected based on the date of operation. For analysis starting in 1900 all weather stations that were operational in 1900 and operational at the end of the analysis must be used. Weather stations that were not operational at the start of the analysis cannot be used because they will induce an unknown bias that cannot be accounted for.5. From there the data can be graphed, or each months delta for the year can be averaged to create a yearly change for a simpler graph. 1900 to Present Precipitation:The Figure 1 below shows the change in precipitation from 1900 to 2015. As shown the precipitation for 1900 to 1930 stays consistently above the average median by about 1mm. The graph of SO2 emissions is there to demonstrate the correlation found in Global Dimming is present in this data. SO2 impedes precipitation by blocking the amount of light that reaches ocean organisms like Phytoplankton that create critical rain cloud compounds[1]. It also cutbacks on plant life by reducing light which also means less water in the air from plant transpiration which is what 90% of the water a plant gets is used for[5].As SO2 emissions were successfully cut back in 1990 there is a clear indication of an increase in precipitation. At most it increased to similar levels in the 40apos;s and 50apos;s up until around 2005. It is my burden to prove that the radical increase post 2005 in precipitation is clearly caused by factors not created by man.Figure 1: 1971 to Present Pan Evaporation Rate: Fortunately, NOAAapos;s dataset does provide additional detail to see what may have changed in Figure 2. If evaporation increased due to additional heat it should appear in the Pan Evaporation rate. Regretfully there is an insufficient number of stations with pan evaporation rate data going back to 1900 so to increase the number of stations to a sufficient number for analysis the start date has been moved to 1971 allowing us to use 124 stations.Rather than show a gradual increase evaporation from gradual warming the pan evaporation stays constant from 1971 until about 2010-2011 where it then makes a radical change which correlates to the radical change in precipitation.Figure 2: 1980 to Present Precipitation and Evaporation:In order to get a better idea of what is happening the date range will need to be compressed further to allow the number of stations to be increased for further analysis. This way we will have 10,209 stations for precipitation, and 156 stations for evaporation for monthly analysis. We can see in Figure 3 better detail what a 20% decrease in SO2 pollution did to the precipitation rate. Unfortunately the increase in 2005, and later, was due to China, and India having increased SO2 pollution[7].Now we can see a mild increase in evaporation starting in 2005, and the shift in 2010 can be isolated to October 2010 using a box and whiskers analysis on the dataset to flag outliers.Figure 3: Solar Forcing of Evaporation:October 2010 is a very important time period. It marks a violent beginning of the Sunapos;s solar cycle 24 approach to solar maximum as shown with NASAapos;s October 18th 2010 image of the Sun ramping up for a Solar Flare[8]. Note in the Figure 4 October 2010 is not solar maximum, but the significant shift upwards in sunspot. By graphing the Sunapos;s Sunspots it is possible to see if cycle 24 had an actual influence on the evaporation rate. Clearly the increase in evaporation has many of the same features as cycle 24 in Figure 4. However, none of the prior cycles appear to have any significant influence. However, in 2008 NASA announced that they had discovered the Earthapos;s Electromagnetic Field was weakening[2]. This weakening most likely began before it was detected leading one to believe that higher than normal levels of light, and radiation began to leak in explaining the small increase during the previous solar minimum. As the field began weakening further evaporation accelerated. This also feed more plants, and phytoplankton allowing for more rapid development of rain clouds post 2005.Now that the Earthapos;s field is weakening 10 times faster[3] than before explaining the continued increase even thow sunspots are on the decline. None of the increases above 1900 to 1930 norms can be attributed to any man made causes, and is entirely separate from any global warming claims. The accelerated water cycle is caused by the complex machinations of the Sun, and Earthapos;s Magnetic Field.Figure 4:[1]http://oceanworld.tamu.edu...[2]http://science.nasa.gov...[3]http://www.livescience.com...[4]http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu...[5]http://www.ext.colostate.edu...[6]ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/[7]https://espo.nasa.gov...[8]http://apod.nasa.gov...</t>

Unfortunately the increase in 2005, and later, was due to China, and India having increased SO2 pollution[7].Now we can see a mild increase in evaporation starting in 2005, and the shift in 2010 can be isolated to October 2010 using a box and whiskers analysis on the dataset to flag outliers.Figure 3:Solar Forcing of Evaporation:October 2010 is a very important time period. It marks a violent beginning of the Sun’s solar cycle 24 approach to solar maximum[8]. By graphing the Sun’s Sunspots it is possible to see if cycle 24 had an actual influence on the evaporation rate. Clearly the increase in evaporation has many of the same features as cycle 24 in Figure 4. However, none of the prior cycles appear to have any significant influence. However, in 2008 NASA announced that they had discovered the Earthapos;s Electromagnetic Field was weakening[2], and that solar cycle 24 would subject the Earth to more solar storms. This weakening most likely began before it was detected leading one to believe that higher than normal levels of light, and radiation began to leak in explaining the small increase during the previous solar minimum. As the field began weakening further evaporation accelerated. This also feed more plants, and phytoplankton allowing for more rapid development of rain clouds post 2005.Now that the Earthapos;s field is weakening 10 times faster[3] than before explaining the continued increase even thow sunspots are on the decline. None of the increases above 1900 to 1930 norms can be attributed to any man made causes, and is entirely separate from any global warming claims. The accelerated water cycle is caused by the complex machinations of the Sun, and Earthapos;s Magnetic Field.Figure 4:[1]http://oceanworld.tamu.edu...[2]http://science.nasa.gov...[3]http://www.livescience.com...[4]http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu...[5]http://www.ext.colostate.edu...[6]ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/[7]https://espo.nasa.gov...[8]http://apod.nasa.gov...</t>

    <t>I would like to remind my opponent that they had ample time to review what the arguments would be long before even accepting the debate.  My opponent makes the claim that global warming is bad, and should be stopped. However, this is contingent on the existence of global warming. One of the claims of global warming is that it has accelerated the water cycle, and my claim is that global warming has not. If one of the claims of global warming is in doubt that it is reasonable to doubt that global warming exists as claimed.  As for the quality of the water cycles nature as Good, or Bad that is irrelevant to this debate, and subjective. An accelerated water cycle would mean more fresh water, and many people are in need of more fresh water. However, it could also make large storms more prevalent for others. It is irrelevant since this debate is about global warming having caused it, and not about if it is good, or bad.</t>

    <t>Dam Rivers:I like that river in Egypt - De Nile. Fun fact, since 1970 the Nile in Egypt hasn’t done it’s annual floods. Amazing isn’t it? A river iconified in myth, and legend representing the cycles of death and rebirth though its life giving floods depositing fertile silt hasn’t flooded in almost 4 and a half decades. It’s amazing what changes the Aswan Dam has done to the Nile for Egypt.My opponent brings up an important point about the freshwater river mouth surge data, and that it is of a very limited time frame of 1994 to 2006. That wouldn’t actually contradict my data since from 1990 there was in an increasing trend in precipitation due to a reduction in SO2 pollution. However, it has an even bigger flaw. Even if there was an increase in precipitation there is very little reason it would actually increase the outflow of water at a river mouth. Perhaps two centuries ago it would have, but over the last 200 years we have left very few rivers free of hydro engineering[9].Any excess water has a much better chance of being banked into the worldapos;s reservoir system then it has of just being flushed downstream. It’s not like we don’t have irrigation networks built to divert overflow in one reservoir into other depleted reservoirs[11][12].quot;Our reservoir system is built so that as one reservoir fills that water spills over into another reservoir,quot; Libby Pischel[13]So why would we have any increase in river water at the mouth of a river unless we did it deliberately? If the last reservoir on a river overflows then it would have no where to go, but the last reservoir only represents a small fraction of the dammed water. A more likely cause is increased electrical demand. If we want to utilize the water for electricity we have to send it down to the next dam so it can use it for electricity[14]. Then there is fish and wildlife maintenance were we deliberately maintain a higher rate of speed to keep the fish healthy[15]. One may be able to argue that the over dammed waterways are a detriment, or a boom. However, there is hardly a single cubic foot of water that leave waterways that we didn’t intend on it leaving. Had my opponentapos;s source been able to tap into a larger samples with with less of a limited sampling bias by having river data from prior to the rise of dams they may have come to a different conclusion.Global Historical Climatology Network:The advantage to the GHCN data that I’ve processed is that is that is contains all of the worldapos;s weather station data.  It makes it possible to attempt to verify what is, or is not wrong with my opponentapos;s source that claims that there has been a 12% increase in weather ‘events’. Unfortunately, the actual study is hidden behind a nice pay wall, but the abstract can be read here.http://link.springer.com...It is also cross references another study at the American Meteorological Society[17], and the PDF can be viewed here.http://envsci.rutgers.edu...The first problem with all studies of extreme precipitation events can be summarized by quoting a part of the 2nd page on the study above.These and other studies, which all differ in their methods of analysis, definition of extreme precipitation indices, and/or the observational datasets used, consistently report increases in extreme precipitation in more land locations globally than locations with decreases.In other words the definition of ‘extreme precipitation’ is a cherry picked definition, and all of these are only of ‘extreme’ events, and not a sum, average, or median of the precipitation. The reason they don’t use the far more direct argument is that would be Figure 1, and it disagrees with their world view.Further analysis of my opponents source reveals a claim that shows that their results are nothing more than an anomaly caused by their statistical methodology. To quote his sourceThe average increase is 12 percent globally – but 56 percent in South East Asia56% is an outlier nearly 4 and a half times away from the average, and should have flagged the results for closer scrutiny. A closer examination of the South East Asia, SEA, precipitation data in GHCN data shows the cause as limited sampling bias. In other words, SEA has about 369 weather stations reporting precipitation data. However, the earliest weather stations started reporting in 1943: SONGKHLA, DON MUANG, CHIANG MAI, and UDON THANI. A statistically viable sample doesn’t even exist until 1950 when about 30 to 100 stations are reporting. That puts the majority of SEA’s measurements after Global Dimming had reduced the precipitation rate so it stands to reason that they’d see an increase in ‘extreme’ precipitation when rain started to return to normal in 1990.By including weather station with varying limited sampling bias like SEA they induced a non response bias into their 12% figure. This kind of bias is actually addressed in my analysis in step 4. By restricting the analysis to only include those that existed at the start, and at the end non response bias is mitigated only to events that may have shut a station down for a period of time. Limited sampling bias is also addressed by using the largest date range, and maintain a suitably large sample size.Humidity:As for my opponents 3rd source that attempts to prove that humidity has escalated due to global warming it suffers from the same deficiencies as his other sources. Namely limited sampling bias. The study uses only time period of 1973 to 2007 which means that it falls completely under the Clean Air Act of 1970 where SO2 emissions were held back and then reduced in the 90’s. Because of their samples limited score they’d be unable to determine if the cause was out of line with an atmosphere returning more to a 1930’s era, or if it was global warming.[9] http://www.bbc.com...[10] http://www.nsf.gov...[11] http://www.usbr.gov...[12] http://www.usbr.gov...[13] http://abc7news.com...[14] http://water.usgs.gov...[15] http://fishandgame.idaho.gov...[16] http://www.pbs.org...[17] http://journals.ametsoc.org...</t>

    <t>I would like to thank my opponent for accepting this challenge.I will be presenting a controversial view that Global Warming has not accelerated the water cycle. This will have actual analysis of weather station data from NOAA. It is a large dataset, and I am willing to show anyone who asks how to begin analysing it. The Evaporation data is small enough to analyse in excel, but precipitation data would require a database or custom tools to work with.Analysis Method:In order to estimate precipitation, and evaporation levels I will be utilizing the NOAA GHCND weather station dataset. If you wish to download and verify the dataset can be found here: ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/ 1) To process this data the first step is to convert each stations monthly 31 day values into a single monthly median value for each station.2) Then each stations monthly median values are averages to create the average median for the life of the station.3) The station average median is then subtracted from the station median to create a delta that represents that stations change away from the average median.4) Stations are then selected based on the date of operation. For analysis starting in 1900 all weather stations that were operational in 1900 and operational at the end of the analysis must be used. Weather stations that were not operational at the start of the analysis cannot be used because they will induce an unknown bias that cannot be accounted for.5) From there the data can be graphed, or each months delta for the year can be averaged to create a yearly change for a simpler graph. 1900 to Present Precipitation The Figure 1 below shows the change in precipitation from 1900 to 2015. As shown the precipitation for 1900 to 1930 stays consistently above the average median by about 1mm. The graph of SO2 emissions is there to demonstrate the correlation found in Global Dimming is present in this data. SO2 impedes precipitation by blocking the amount of light that reaches ocean organisms like Phytoplankton that create critical rain cloud compounds[1]. It also cutbacks on plant life by reducing light which also means less water in the air from plant transpiration which is what 90% of the water a plant gets is used for[5].As SO2 emissions were successfully cut back in 1990 there is a clear indication of an increase in precipitation. At most it increased to similar levels in the 40’s and 50’s up until around 2005. It is my burden to prove that the radical increase post 2005 in precipitation is clearly caused by factors not created by man.Figure 1:1971 to Present Pan Evaporation Rate:Fortunately, NOAA’s dataset does provide additional detail to see what may have changed in Figure 2. If evaporation increased due to additional heat it should appear in the Pan Evaporation rate. Regretfully there is an insufficient number of stations with pan evaporation rate data going back to 1900 so to increase the number of stations to a sufficient number for analysis the start date has been moved to 1971 allowing us to use 124 stations.Rather than show a gradual increase evaporation from gradual warming the pan evaporation stays constant from 1971 until about 2010-2011 where it then makes a radical change which correlates to the radical change in precipitation.Figure 2:1980 to Present Precipitation and EvaporationIn order to get a better idea of what is happening the date range will need to be compressed further to allow the number of stations to be increased for further analysis. This way we will have 10,209 stations for precipitation, and 156 stations for evaporation for monthly analysis. We can see in Figure 3 better detail what a 20% decrease in SO2 pollution did to the precipitation rate. Unfortunately the increase in 2005, and later, was due to China, and India having increased SO2 pollution[7].Now we can see a mild increase in evaporation starting in 2005, and the shift in 2010 can be isolated to October 2010 using a box and whiskers analysis on the dataset to flag outliers.Figure 3:Solar Forcing of Evaporation:October 2010 is a very important time period.

    <t>I would like to thank medv4380 for presenting his arguments.The Water CycleI want to start by providing a brief description of the water cycle, and what it means to accelerate the water cycle. At the most basic level, the water cycle is the explanation of why precipitation occurs. Water evaporates from the oceans as a result of solar heat input, rises into the atmosphere, condenses as the air gets cooler (forming clouds), moves on land, releases its water, which heads back circuitously into the ocean. Here is a picture showing the many intricacies of the water cycle:[1]The acceleration of the water cycle would mean that the cycle is becoming stronger - more water evaporates, implying that more precipitation occurs. It is my burden, then, to show that more precipitation is occurring now compared to 115 years ago.Global Warming and the Water CycleAt the most basic level, a warmer climate would mean that there would be more precipitation, because more water would evaporate from the oceans, due to the fact that the chance of a water molecule in the oceans breaking free of its bonds with other water molecules would be more likely to escape, and given enougn kinetic energy (and itapos;s moving in the right direction), the water would do so. While the climate does work like this, the climate is a bit more complicated than that. Some places will get dryer because warmer climates dry the soil out faster, and regions that donapos;t typically get a lot of rain can suffer as a result.There are many ways one can observe an acceleration of the climate cycle. One obvious way would be to find that the amount of precipitation falling around the Earth is increasing. This is indeed the case. quot;An advanced statistical analysis of rainfall data from the years 1901 to 2010 derived from thousands of weather stations around the globe shows that over 1980-2010 there were 12 percent more of these events than expected in a stationary climate, a scenario without global warming.quot; This seems to show that global warming is accelerating the water cycle. However, there are many other indicators that this is so.[2]One could look at how much water is being evaporated from the oceans and how much water is running off in rivers, for example (weapos;d expect an increase in both of these indicators).  A measure of how much water is being evaporated is humidity - a measure of the quot;saturationquot; of the atmosphere (the atmosphere can only hold so much water vapor; humidity measures the percentage of this amount). The greater the evaporation, the greater the global humidity, because thereapos;s more water vapor in the atmosphere. quot;All five reanalyses produce similar relations, with increasing surface temperature being associated with increasing atmospheric specific humidity. These results agree with previous analyses that the water vapor feedback in response to shortR08; term variations is strongly positive. This is also consistent with P09, who looked at the seasonal cycle in the extratropics in the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis and found that it showed a positive correlation between surface temperature and 500 hPa specific humidity.quot;[3]How much water is being run off in rivers?  quot;For the relatively short 13-year period studied here, global discharge increased by 540 km^3W25;y^2 [this is a rate of approximately 1.5 percent a year], which was largely attributed to an increase of globalocean evaporation (768 km^3W25;y^2). Sustained growth of these flux rates into long-term trends would provide evidence for increasing intensity of the hydrologic cycle.quot; A graph of this increase can be seen below[4][5]: The data that clouds give us is more difficult to understand. Youapos;d think that more evaporation would entail there being more clouds, but this isnapos;t necessarily true. The way clouds work is much more complicated than that. In addition, you have to contend with the feedbacks that clouds cause.What is the evidence that the acceleration of the water cycle is due to global warming? Well, warmer air holds more moisture. Weapos;d expect precipitation increases to follow the change in the temperature of the atmosphere. quot;While a statistical analysis of course cannot provide direct physical cause-effect relations, the scientists compared their findings to existing knowledge about how much more water can be stored in the atmosphere when temperatures rise, as given by the well-known Clausius-Clapeyron equation. This additional moisture can be released during short-term heavy rainfall events. The scientists show that the observed increase in unprecedented heavy rainfall events generally fits with this thermodynamically expected increase under global warming.quot;[2]Overall, the significant acceleration of the water cycle is unlikely to be due to any natural variation of the climate, nor is it likely to just be a statistical anomoly. The theory behind anthropogenic global warming clearly explains why the water cycle is accelerating, as a warmer atmosphere would evaporate water faster and would be able to hold more of that water vapor.ConclusionOverall, the water cycle involves evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and runoff. Iapos;ve shown that evaporation (in the form of humidity), precipitation, and runoff have all increased, and this is most likely due to global warming, due to the connection between warming and the acceleration of the water cycle.Sources[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org...[2]: https://www.pik-potsdam.de...[3]: http://geotest.tamu.edu...[4]: http://www.pnas.org...[5]: http://www.skepticalscience.com...</t>

    <t>I’d like to thank my opponent for his response.Unfortunately my opponent hasn’t fully grasped my main argument. It’s understandable if you havenapos;t been following the news generated from my second citation. I can only assume that the news involving a possible polar flip in our life times isn’t as interesting to most people, or at least it doesn’t generate enough of a news bite to say in the news for long.I’m not actually referencing the continual weakening of the Earth’s magnetic field. Rather it’s in reference to a rapid, and unexpected weakening that is believed to be leading to a polar flip. The THEMIS satellites that are responsible for this discovery were launched around 2007 in response to increasing atmospheric anomalies that started to draw concern around 2005. The big issue THEMIS found which was what was reported in 2008 was that the Earth’s EMF northerly aligned fields when hit by northerly aligned Coronal Mass Ejections, CME, was ripping open rather than deflecting them. As it was put by the scientists involved.quot;To the lay person, this may sound like a quibble, but to a space physicist, it is almost seismic. When I tell my colleagues, most react with skepticism, as if Iapos;m trying to convince them that the sun rises in the west.quot;[2]So according to the scientists would this do anything for Solar Cycle 24?quot;Weapos;re entering Solar Cycle 24. For reasons not fully understood, CMEs in even-numbered solar cycles (like 24) tend to hit Earth with a leading edge that is magnetized north. Such a CME should open a breach and load the magnetosphere with plasma just before the storm gets underway. Itapos;s the perfect sequence for a really big event.quot;[2]In other words, it’s loading the Earthapos;s Atmosphere with an unusually large load of heat, and solar energy. My claim is this excess energy gets expressed as evaporation which is why figure 4 evaporation rates correlate to to cycles 24, but not any other cycle.So is this unusual?quot;Weapos;ve seen things like this before, but never on such a large scale. The entire day-side of the magnetosphere was open to the solar wind.quot;[2]So yes, but never on this scale, and it’s this scale that makes it visible in the current cycle, but not any of the data my opponent brought up. His data all ends at 2000, and doesn’t go back far enough to see what the prior flip had. Not surprising since that would be 780,000 years ago for the last major flip, or about 40,000 years for the last minor flip that lasted only a few hundred years.I can understand my opponent not understanding my claim, but I did cite it so he could, if he had more time, read the source.I’m under no illusions about this argument ether. Many people will want to vote against me based on a belief that the claims of Global Warming must be true. For those I ask that you take the time to examine the data I’ve linked too. My methodology is sound for the generating of the graphs I have personally rendered, and the raw data is from a reliable source, NOAA.If you’ve verified data, and the methodology then you are left with only one question. Why does the evaporation rate so clearly correlate to cycle 24, and not any other cycle? Surely if it was Global Warming caused by man it should have started moving up long before 2005, but from a statistical standpoint it is flat throughout the entire period prior. This can only mean that the heat from global warming responsible for evaporation is either nonexistent, or so minor that it cannot be seen with a sample of the given size, but that cycle 24 is.Keep in mind that if you side with my opponent that his evidence for precipitation is deficient for the time period that this debate covers, and is heavily biased by our water management of the rivers via dams. His humidity data is also deficient for the time period, and is explained by Global Dimming caused by SO2. The data the he has that does cover the time period is cluttered with weather stations with an incomplete coverage of the time period resulting in a biased that favored the cherry picked statistic of “extreme” weather events. Had he picked a study that used a sum, or average precipitation, and accounted for nonresponse bias that the result with be similar, or identical, to my Figure 1 graph.I realize that it is difficult for many voters to vote against global warming. However, I have presented a sound case against the claim that global warming is accelerating the water cycle.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank medv4380 for presenting his rebuttals.If Iapos;m reading my opponentapos;s argument correctly, he seems to be arguing that solar activity is the cause of the evaporation increase, saying that the reduction in solar activity causes the Earthapos;s magnetic field to weaken, causing more radiation to reach Earth. However, if this is indeed his case, it has two problems. One, it posits that the strength of the Earthapos;s magnetic field is determined by solar activity, and that there is a correlation between magnetic field strength and water cycle strength.Earthapos;s magnetic field originates from moving charged particles at its core. quot;Magnetic fields are produced by the motion of electrical charges. For example, the magnetic field of a bar magnet results from the motion of negatively charged electrons in the magnet. The origin of the Earthapos;s magnetic field is not completely understood, but is thought to be associated with electrical currents produced by the coupling of convective effects and rotation in the spinning liquid metallic outer core of iron and nickel. This mechanism is termed the dynamo effect.quot; Thus, it seems that solar activity has nothing to do with the strength of the Earthapos;s magnetic field. A decline in solar activity then would not cause the water cycle to accelerate. But thereapos;s still the problem of whether magnetic field strength has any effect on the temperature. Below are three graphs - one of the Earthapos;s magnetic dipole moment (a measure of how strong the Earthapos;s magnetic field is), one of solar irradiance (a measure of solar activity), and one of a measure of precipitation levels.s://www.ipcc.ch...; alt=quot;Figure TS.10quot; /gt;[2][3][4]As you can see, it doesnapos;t appear that Eaerthapos;s magnetic field strength correlates with solar activity. In fact, just purely looking at the data, it appears that the opposite is true - increased solar irradiance decreases Earthapos;s magnetic field strength, not decreased solar irradiance. As for the magnetic field strength/precipitation correlation, the question is a bit more complicated. Unfortunately, we donapos;t have (or at least I canapos;t find) global precipitation anomalies for more than 100 years. However, thereapos;s two things Iapos;d like to note. One, if precipitation was really affected by magnetic field strength due to the amount of solar radiation Earth absorbs, then, since the decrease in magnetic field strength is linearly downwards, weapos;d expect precipitation levels to follow solar irradiance, because that also determines how much radiation the Earth receives. However, precipitation trends do not seem to follow solar irradiance (if they did, youapos;d expect 11-year cycles in precipitation levels). And two, youapos;d think that, since solar activity has been decreasing a lot lately, that precipitation levels would trend down. If the amount of radiation reaching Earth is the key here, then youapos;d need to consider solar irradiance and magnetic field strength together. The most you have is a 5-year trend. In the grand scheme of the 115 years this debate considers, thatapos;s a statistically insignificant trend, especially since the magnetic field strength has been declining for at least 400 years, and there donapos;t seem to be any other precipitation/solar irradiance links for any of the other solar cycles.ConclusionI apologize if this was a bit choppy - Iapos;ve had a lot do the past few days. However, I feel like Iapos;ve covered the gist of it. The solar irradiance/magnetic field strength and magnetic field strength/water cycle rate correlations do not seem to exist, save for the past five years, which is statistically insignificant on climatological time scales.Sources[1]: http://csep10.phys.utk.edu...[2]: http://deeptow.whoi.edu...[3]: http://aphnew.aph.gov.au...[4]: https://www.ipcc.ch...</t>

    <t>I would like to thank medv4380 for this debate.Dam RiversThere are three responses to this. One, human impacts only account for about half of the observed increase in river runoff. quot;On average, land-use change has increased global runoff by 0.08 mm/year^2 and accounts for ~50% of the reconstructed global runoff trend over the last century.quot; Thereapos;s still the other half that needs to be accounted for.[1]Two, CO2 also has a negative effect on river runoff. quot;When allowing for the increase in foliage area that results from increasing atmospheric CO2 levels in a global vegetation model, we find a decrease in global runoff from 1901 to 1999.quot; This seems a bit counterintuitive. However, the increased precipitation that CO2 induced warming has caused has still had an effect on the rivers. The effect is just masked by the land-use changes and negative feedback related to plant growth. This is entirely separate from the water cycle.[1]And three, this topic has been very controversial, namely owing to different collections of data and statistical methods used with that data. However, this science is solid.HumidityActually, decreased SO2 levels would cause humidity levels to reduce. quot;Trajectory studies and model simulations suggest that the SO2increase results in the formation of more sulfuric acid aerosol particles in the upper tropical troposphere. As a consequence, more ice crystals of smaller size are formed in the tropical tropopause, which are lifted into the stratosphere more readily. Our model calculations suggest that such a mechanism could increase the amount of water that entered the stratosphere in the condensed phase by up to 0.5 ppmv from 1950–2000.quot; While the decrease in SO2 emissions has slowed the rise in humidity levels a little, CO2 levels are still rising exponentially.[2]ConclusionOverall, this is basic physics. A warmer climate, caused by rising greenhouse gas emissions, causes more water to evaporate from the oceans, which causes more rain to fall, which causes the river runoff to increase. While we have been affecting river runoff in other ways, the underlying data is still there. My opponent has also failed to adequately refute my humidity (related to the amount of water in the atmosphere), and he has completely dropped my precipitation point. My opponent has provided a confusing, uncertain, and misguided argument himself. The evidence supports the conclusion that human induced global warming is the cause of the acceleration of the water cycle.Sources[1]: http://www.pnas.org...[2]: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com...</t>

    <t>Thank you Pro.   C1: Nuclear Weapons seriously threaten the human race   Nuclear weapons are so far one of the only weapons mankind has developed that could end the human race as we know it, and in fact, almost did more than once. In 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the world was close to nuclear war. Former Sec. of Defence Robert McNamara said, “We lucked out. It was luck that prevented a nuclear war. We came that close to nuclear war. Rational individuals! Kennedy was rational, Khrushchev was rational, Castro was rational. Rational individuals came that close to total destruction of their societies, and that danger exists today. The major lesson of the Cuban Missile Crisis is this: the indefinite combination of human fallibility and nuclear weapons will destroy nations!” Almost no other weapon besides perhaps chemical warfare has the kind of domino effect that nuclear weapons has. If one is launched, many will be launched. All it takes is the wrong leader with the right capability. A nation like North Korea, or Pakistan, or even Israel. If 100 small, regional nuclear devices were detonated, we would lose 20-50% of the ozone, followed by a brutal nuclear winter – difficult to survive. If a proper nuclear war occurred, with a real arsenal being launched, we could expect to see the extinction of the human race – a terrible nuclear winter, crippling UV damage, rapid cooling down -30 degrees Celsius, not to mention the primary effects of the weapons themselves. Bombs made fifty years ago were so powerful they could ‘scorch earth’ nine miles of land above ground and penetrate 230 m underground. When the Soviet Union tested the nuke ‘Tsar Bomba’ almost sixty years ago the resulting explosion was so powerful it blew a 5 mile fireball followed by a 35 mile high mushroom cloud that burst past the stratosphere into the mesosphere. This was 54 years ago, and that explosion blew the windows in houses 125 miles away and caused a 5.5 earthquake. Let’s not even imagine what kind of weapons we must have today.

Pro depends not on the main focus of this debate, that is, nuclear weapons, but rather nuclear power/energy. This is another matter altogether. Nuclear power has drawbacks: waste, the danger of a meltdown, etc. He didn’t defend nuclear weapons, but rather nuclear power. As for his defense of the weapons in relation to WWII, that point is debatable. One A-Bomb was more than enough.

    <t>IntroductionWelcome. As debate over the Trans-Pacific Partnership heats up, questions about the benefits and drawbacks of free trade are being raised by people from all sides of the political spectrum.This debate will not be a defense of the TPP, as I do not know the full details of the bill. Instead, this debate will focus purely on the concept of free trade, and how it effects the US economy. I am an avid support of free trade, and I think it is extremely beneficial to both our country and the countries we trade with. Prerequisites To be eligibile to debate this, you must have a minimum of 3 debates voted on and an elo of 2000. Also, you must make sure that there are no things in your schedule that would potentially prevent you from completing every round. These are very lenient requirements intended to reduce the chance of forfeited rounds,Debate Structure The debate will have 4 rounds, a 72 hour window to respond per round, and a 10,000 character limit.The burden of proof is shared. Con is requried to show that free trade is a net harm to the country, and I am required to show that free trade is a net benefit to the country. Whoever best meets their burden of proof should be voted the winner of this debate.  The rounds will have the following structure:1st Round:-Pro: Introduction-Con: Acceptance2nd Round:-Pro: First Arguments-Con: First Arguments/Rebuttals 3rd Round:-Pro: Arguments/Rebuttals-Con: Arguments/Rebuttals4th Round:-Pro: Arguments/Rebuttals/Conclusion-Con: Arguments/Rebuttals/Conclusion If youapos;re interested in doing this debate, please say so in the comments and I will let the most qualified person accept within a few days.</t>

    <t>The trade regulations I advocate are targeted towards specific problems with unfettered free trade. I donapos;t argue massive tariffs on every industry. To the extent that Proapos;s rebuttals attack wholesale protectionism, they simply miss their mark.SurvivalPro admits that we must drastically reduce carbon emissions to save our planet. Pro admits that we must do this now before itapos;s too late. And Pro admits that global warming is an externality. Yet instead of *internalizing* global warming, Pro says weapos;re better off leaving our survival to the chance that the market will reduce emissions on its own.Pro fails to realize that free trade is driven solely by prices, and if prices donapos;t account for the harmful effects of carbon emissions, thereapos;s no incentive to reduce carbon emissions. In fact, the opposite happens: carbon emissions increase as a way to grab a cost advantage. Carbon emissions have increased every single year over the past 30 years as weapos;ve liberalized trade. We need to change that now. And the change canapos;t be incremental. We need to lower emissions by at least 8-10%  per year to ensure our survival. [23] Free markets alone canapos;t effect that kind of change.Pro dismisses my arguments because they lacked any sources. But not all arguments require sources. Mine doesnapos;t. The argument I made is analytic, not empirical. But experience proves me right.Pro also cites two sources. They donapos;t help.The first source quot;estimatesquot; that a 1% increase in sulfur dioxide output from free trade leads to a decrease in sulfur dioxide concentration of around .8%. The estimation is based on a limited theoretic framework and limited empirical data (since it doesnapos;t look at actual free trade). Itapos;s also totally irrelevant because it dealt with sulfur dioxide. The source even notes that limitation explicitly: quot;Free trade appears to lower sulfur dioxide concentrations for an average country in our sample, but may of course worsen the environment through other channels. Our evidence is specific to sulfur dioxide.quot; The issue in this debate is reducing carbon dioxide, not sulfur dioxide. Carbon emissions are an entirely different ballpark. The regulations that affect carbon are completely different than the regulations that affect sulfur emissions. Also, note that Proapos;s source actually finds an increase in pollution output. Itapos;s the increase in output that also leads to a decrease in concentration. This is very limited evidence compared to the huge number of studies showing harm to the environment from free trade: [18] [19] [20] [21] [22]  Proapos;s second source supports my argument, not Proapos;s. It states: quot;Current actions are not enough if we are to stabilize greenhouse gases (GHGs) at any acceptable level. The economic challenges are complex and will require a long-term international collaboration to tackle them.quot; Acknowleding that quot;no [trade] measures for climate change are in use anywhere in the world,quot; it finds that quot;theoretical analysis points to a role for trade restrictions.quot; In fact, Pro completely distorts his sourceapos;s findings. Pro fails to mention that weapos;re talking about liberalizing trade in renewables while maintaining tariffs on fossil fuels. The study finds, just as I suggested in R2, that taxing carbon-intensive industries while liberalizing trade in renewables leads to increased use of renewables, which in turn leads to a reduction in emissions. This is precisely what I suggested would happen with a tariff targeted specifically at fossil fuels.  Pro argues that quot;tariffs would lead to an inefficient allocation of resources due to the loss of comparative advantage.quot; But inefficiency is a better outcome than human extinction. And again, Proapos;s argument relies on the theory of quot;comparative advantage,quot; which is wrong (see R2). Pro dropped that, or apparently deferred his response.Pro says quot;losing efficiency means more waste and higher emissions from inefficient production.quot; This is untrue. First, Pro offers no evidence that quot;inefficient allocationquot; leads to quot;inefficient production.quot; On the contrary, as Proapos;s second source suggests, targeted tariffs and subsidies can increase efficient production and reduce emissions by encouraging efficient clean energy. Second, quot;wastequot; refers to an economic loss, not to an environmental harm. Donapos;t let Pro muddle this this issue: weapos;re weighing potential economic growth against certain extinction of our species. Given our looming planetary ecological catastrophe, itapos;s clear that environmental protections are necessary even at the cost of degrowth. Which isnapos;t to say thereapos;s any degrowth; Iapos;m just emphasizing the importance of collapse of reducing emissions.  SustainabilityPro argues that thereapos;s no link between free trade and our international investment position. But that is simply untrue. Free trade *allows* deficit trading, which is directly related to a countryapos;s international investment position. An international investment position is a statement of a countryapos;s foreign assets and debts. Free trade creates foreign debts via trade deficits.Pro completely drops my impacts. The results of deficit trading are disastrous for our economy. If there are any economic benefits to free trade, theyapos;re completely outweighed by the harms from deficit trading.Trade regulations can bring our trade closer into balance. Warren Buffet suggested one solution: give exporters 1 dolar certificates for every dollar they export, and then require that importers buy a certificate for every dollar of goods they import. This would immediately bring our trade into balance.Pro broadly asserts that all trade regulations hurt the economy. But Pro offers no substantiation for this assertion. Iapos;ve explained how trade deficits weaken our economy. Pro hasnapos;t argued otherwise.Smoot-Hawley is irrelevant. Iapos;m donapos;t argue for Smoot-Hawley or anything even remotely similar. I support initiatives that bring our trade closer to balance, not drastic increases on tariffs for all industries. Proapos;s attack on Smoot-Hawley is a strawman and a red herring.InequalityPro admits that free trade increases inequality. Pro also drops all the impacts of inequality. Those impacts include more mental illness, drug abuse, obesity, teenage pregnancy, crime, violence, lower life expectancy, harm to trust and community life, harm to overall child well-being, and unsurprisingly, harm to the economy.Remarkably, Pro nonetheless asserts without any substantiation that economic growth from free trade outweighs all these social harms. I have two responses. First, the impact from an increase in GDP simply cannot outweigh these harms. Pro doesnapos;t even tell us what the impact is. Growth has little if any positive impact. It simply means more wealth. It doesnapos;t tell us who possesses that wealth. Nor does it tell us if more wealth is good for those people.What are they buying with that money? In the US, only a tiny proportion of production and human labor is devoted to actual human needs as opposed to market-generated wants. Over a trillion dollars is spent every year on marketing. More growth means more marketing, more market-generated wants, and more consumption of stuff we donapos;t need. More growth doesnapos;t mean more food, clothing, shelter, health care, education, or public transportation. More growth doesnapos;t mean a cleaner environment. More growth doesnapos;t mean less poverty or inequality. And most importantly, more growth doesnapos;t mean more happiness. Research has found quot;no trace of a relationship between income and happiness.quot; In fact, studies suggest that quot;wealth may undermine peopleapos;s ability to savor positive events.quot; [17] In other words, the rich may experience less happiness because awesome things like caviar and champagne become a regular experience instead of something to appreciate and savor. Accumulating wealth for its own sake might even be net harmful.Second, Pro fails to address my point that inequality slows economic growth. Pro hasnapos;t offered a single reason to believe that growth from free trade outweighs degrowth from inequality. Proapos;s source, an article by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, offers no substantiation for its assertions. The article doesnapos;t explain how free trade leads to job growth. It simply assert that free trade increases GDP based on an observed GDP increase. But thereapos;s no analysis as to what caused the GDP increase; it could have been any number of things besides free trade. And even if GDP increases, it doesnapos;t mean the benefits pass onto most Americans. Most Americans work blue-collar jobs and are thus left unemployed by free trade. Then, they end up less happy because of greater inequality, and end up being at higher risk for mental illness, obesity, crime, and all the other impacts of inequality. To assert that an abstract quantifier like GDP outweighs all the harms from an increase in inequality simply misunderstands the nature of human well-being and happiness.RebuttalPro defers his defense of quot;innovation and the gains of tradequot; until R4. This deprives me of a rebuttal in R3, which is both unfair and a violation of Proapos;s requirements in R1. With three days per round, Pro effectively gets nine days to write his defense while I only get three days to respond. Timing matters. Six extra days of research and polish increases the quality of oneapos;s arguments significantly. Pro gets an unfair structural advantage because of that. If Pro had no intention of addressing my rebuttal until R4, the debate should have been structured to limit rebuttals to R3 and R4. Instead, Pro required rebuttal in R2. Not addressing that rebuttal until R4 is abusive towards that requirement. Pro says he quot;ran out of time.quot; But thatapos;s not an excuse. Everyone must balance time. R1 states: quot;you must make sure that there are no things in your schedule that would potentially prevent you from completing every round.quot; Yet Pro couldnapos;t complete his round because he quot;ran out of time.quot; Punish him for that.Sources in the comments and reposted in R4.</t>

  <pair id="275" entailment="NONENTAILMENT" task="IE">
    <t>Iapos;ll start with my arguments and then do a rebuttal.Free trade poses an existential threat to human survival97% of climate scientists agree that humans are causing global warming. [1] Climate change harms agriculture, human health, ecosystems, water supplies, and the economy. [2] If greenhouse gas emissions continue at their current rate, weapos;ll soon reach a tipping point, after which runaway climate change will make the planet uninhabitable to humans. [3]Free trade is incompatible with reducing emissions, slowing climate warming, and saving our planet. Under a free trade regime, prices are set solely by supply and demand, so social costs like climate change and environmental damage arenapos;t reflected in a goodapos;s price. Economists call these unaccounted social costs an quot;externality.quot; Free trade is driven by prices, so if prices are wrong due to externalities, free trade will produce bad outcomes.For example, transportation costs. Free trade encourages goods to be made in one place and used very far away. The transportation costs are not only a waste of energy but they also increase the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which speeds up climate change. And, not only does free trade fail to account for carbon emissions from transportation, it also fails to account for carbon emissions from harmful production facilities, as well as radioactive waste from nuclear power, or pollution from pesticides, chemicals, and heavy metals. In fact, free trade not only permits environmental damage but encourages it, as a way to grab a cost advantage.A potential solution is a small, uniform tariff for all imports. This would encourage local production, thereby avoiding an enormous amount of wasted energy in transportation. Another idea is a carbon tax; the US could penalize imports of fossil fuels and other harmful energy-intensive industries. This would help discourage greenhouse gas emissions and encourage clean production facilities and renewable energy sources.Free trade is unsustainableFree trade lets the US import more than it exports (i.e. deficit trading). To make up the difference, the US must assume debt. As a result, foreign countries own over 30 trillion in US assets, and the US net international investment position is -5.445 trillion. [4] The harm to the economy is huge. In 2001, the Economic Strategy Institute estimated that deficit trading shaves at least one percent per year off our economic growth. [5] Economist William Bahr estimates that our trade deficit since 1991 has made our economy 13% smaller than it otherwise would be. [6] Other economists estimate that trade deficits have stunted GDP growth by up to 20%. [4] And trade deficits also destroy jobs (e.g. trade deficits with China cost the US 2.8 million jobs between 2001 and 2008). [7] Free trade increases economic inequalityThe Stolper-Samuelson theorem, an underlying mechanism of free-market economics, says that freer trade raises returns to the abundant facctor of production and lowers returns to the scarce once. [11] In the US, the abundant factor is capital and the scarce one is labor. Thus, according to the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, free trade increases economic inequality. [12] [13] The jobs that suffer most are those that are easily traded for cheap labor abroad. This primarily impacts low-skill workers, who either lose their job or get paid less. Of course, that means free trade hurts most Americans, as most American work the sorts of blue-collar jobs that are easily traded. So weapos;re talking about a massive impact here: a minority gets richer (and these are folks who are already rich), while the vast majority gets poorer. This is unfair. Making an extra 10,000 will improve the well-being of a middle-class family more than losing 10,000 will reduce the well-being of a billionaire. Given that fact, it makes no sense to redistribute wealth to the rich through free trade. Besides, inequality contributes to mental illness, drug abuse, obesity, and teenage pregnancy. It fosters crime and vioelence. It lowers life expectancy. And itapos;s been shown to harm trust and community life, and overall child well-being. [14] [15] This explains why the US has so many problems with drug abuse, crime, imprisonment, and obesity when compared with other countries, since the US is so unequal. Thereapos;s no other explanation. And the case against economic inequality isnapos;t just based on social impacts. New OECD analysis has found a quot;negative and statistically significant correlationquot; between income inequality and economic growth. [16] In other words, inequality also slows economic growth.RebuttalInnovation. Pro says free trade increases innovation. But the evidence shows otherwise; free trade harms innovation. [8] Proapos;s argument rests on the false assumption that more competition necessarily means more innovation. But economists have found the opposite: after a certain point, more competition reduces innovation! [9] [10] Less competition means less market uncertainty, which gives companies more confidence to invest in innovative Ramp;D. Pro underestimates the role that market stability and market concentration plays in innovation. This has led economists to say that the relationship between competition and innovation is an inverted U-shape. In other words, competition only increases innovation up to a certain point, after which more competition actually harms innovation. [8] cites empirical data showing that free trade harms innovation; economic theory cited in [9] and [10] supports this result.Lower prices. Pro says free trade lowers prices. But what Pro misunderstands is that free trade affects relative prices, not the price level (the latter being affected by macro and monetary factors). Free trade lowers the relative price of imports; by necessity, the relative price of exports must go up. Thus, consumers only benefit from free trade if they buy more imports than exports. Thatapos;s not something we can rely on, as many consumers prefer exported goods rather than imported goods (e.g. in Argentina, most consumers eat mostly beef, which also happens to be Argentinaapos;s biggest export). Proapos;s own sources clearly state their limitation to imports.Economic growth. Proapos;s argument rests on the mistaken theory of comparative advantage. Comparative advantage is the idea that itapos;s beneficial to import some goods (including services) in order to free up our workforce to produce more-valuable goods instead. The theory doesnapos;t work because it assumes workers move easily between industries. If workers canapos;t move, imports wonapos;t push a nationapos;s economy into industries better suited to its comparative advantage. Instead, imports will just kill off existing industries and leave nothing in its place. Many workers donapos;t have the skills or donapos;t live in the right place to move between industries. Free trade will leave these workers unemployed. This problem is compounded because of at-will employment and relatively low minimum wage in the US. The result is folks with PhDs in physics making minimum wage because they canapos;t find a better job. In effect, free trade leads to both less jobs and lower wages. The human cost is obvious but thereapos;s an economic one as well: when skills that cost money to acquire (e.g. physics) arenapos;t used, the economy loses large investments in human capital. These losses put the whole economy at risk. Nobel laureate James Tobin put it this way: quot;it takes a heap of Harberger triangles to fill an Okun gap.quot; A Harberger triangle is the area in a supply and demand diagram that measures the loss of taxation (i.e. the benefits of free trade). An Okun gap is the loss in output and employment when the economy falls below potential. Tobinapos;s point is that the benefits of free trade are tiny compared to the huge cost of running our economy below full capacity due to imports and lost jobs. Other benefits. Pro also lists a host of other benefits that supposedly follow from free trade. But these quot;benefitsquot; are bare assertions. Pro doesnapos;t actually offer any evidence/argument about these benefits. Thereapos;s simply no link between these quot;benefitsquot; and quot;free trade.quot;A final point. Free trade creates win-lose situations. Consumers enjoy lower prices on imported goods, but the relative price of exports goes up. And as a result, workers lose their jobs, and get paid less. Given that consumers and workers are ultimately the same people, thereapos;s no way to determine whether these consumers/workers gain more than they lose. No theorem in economics guarantees that the gains of consumers from lower prices on imports outweighs the loss of workers (and higher prices on exports, and lower wages).

    <t>quot;If greenhouse gas emissions continue at their current rate, weapos;ll soon reach a tipping point, after which runaway climate change will make the planet uninhabitable to humans.quot;  You claim that greenhouse gas emissions usage, if continued at this rate, would like to runaway climate change that would make this planet uninhabitable. I will grant you the argument that greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to make the planet uninhabitable. I disagree with the idea that gas emissions would continue at our current rate.   Free Trade is Beneficial to the Environment  quot;Free trade is incompatible with reducing emissions, slowing climate warming, and saving our planet. Under a free trade regime, prices are set solely by supply and demand, so social costs like climate change and environmental damage arenapos;t reflected in a goodapos;s price. Economists call these unaccounted social costs an quot;externality.quot; Free trade is driven by prices, so if prices are wrong due to externalities, free trade will produce bad outcomes.quot;  You provide no sources that demonstrate that free trade is incompatible with reducing emissions and slowing global warming. Negative externalities do result from fossil fuel usage in the form of greenhouse gasses and pollution, but that doesnapos;t mean artificially increasing the price of energy consumption to try to make the price quot;rightquot; would actually benefit society.   On the contrary, there is evidence that free trade actually benefits the environment. One study found that quot;Our estimates of the scale and technique elasticities indicate that, if openness to international markets raises both output and income by 1 percent, pollution concentrations fall by approximately 1 percent. Putting this calculation together with our earlier evidence on composition effects yields a somewhat surprising conclusion with regard to sulfur dioxide: freer trade is good for the environment.quot; http://www.cer.ethz.ch... Free trade would also benefit the environment because it facilitates the spread of more efficient and greener technologies. A World Bank study found that quot;Access to climate-friendly clean energy technologies is especially important for the fast-growing developing economies. Within the context of the current global trade regime, the study finds that a removal of tariffs and NTBs for four basic clean energy technologies (wind, solar, clean coal, and efficient lighting) in 18 of the high-GHG-emitting developing countries will result in trade gains of up to 13 percent. If translated into emissions reductions, these gains suggest that—even within a small subset of clean energy technologies and for a select group of countries—the impact of trade liberalization could be reasonably substantial.quot; http://www-wds.worldbank.org...   quot;For example, transportation costs.quot;  Sure, there are transportation emissions, but the alternative is worse.   quot;A potential solution is a small, uniform tariff for all imports. This would encourage local production, thereby avoiding an enormous amount of wasted energy in transportation. Another idea is a carbon tax; the US could penalize imports of fossil fuels and other harmful energy-intensive industries. This would help discourage greenhouse gas emissions and encourage clean production facilities and renewable energy sources.quot; This proposal to reduce carbon emissions is flawed. First off, tariffs would lead to an inefficient allocation of resources in society due to the loss of comparative advantage. Losing efficiency means more waste and higher emissions from inefficient production. The carbon tax is a regressive tax that burdens poor people the most, would increase the cost of living for everyone, lead to less economic growth, and would not affect oil consumption greatly unless the tax is set enormously high, due to the inelastic demand for oil.   The better solution to facilitate the advancement of alternative energy sources is to decrease regulations that prevent business growth, increase free trade to facilitate the expansion of green technologies, and allow the free market to continue developing alternative energy sources.   Free trade is not incompatible with the reducing carbon emissions. Free trade will lead to the reduction of carbon emissions.  Free trade is Sustainable quot;Free trade lets the US import more than it exports (i.e. deficit trading). To make up the difference, the US must assume debt. As a result, foreign countries own over 30 trillion in US assets, and the US net international investment position is -5.445 trillion. [4]quot;   International investment isnapos;t equivalent to free trade. Free trade is the lack of tariffs and barriers in the transaction of goods and services in the economy. Investing  involves buying and holding stocks, bonds, and mutual funds to achieve a profit later. Tariffs donapos;t directly apply to US international investment.   But while weapos;re on the topic of sustainability, it has been proven time and again that protectionism hurts the economy and is unsustainable.  A famous example of protectionism at work is the Smoot-Hawley Bill. The Smoot-Hawley Bill was a bill that drastically increased tariffs to try to protect American works, but it ended up backfiring and hurting out economy. quot;U.S. imports from Europe declined from a 1929 high of 1,334 million to just 390 million in 1932, while U.S. exports to Europe fell from 2,341 million in 1929 to 784 million in 1932. Overall, world trade declined by some 66% between 1929 and 1934. More generally, Smoot-Hawley did nothing to foster trust and cooperation among nations in either the political or economic realm during a perilous era in international relations.quot; http://future.state.gov...   Free trade increases the standards of living of the poor  quot;The Stolper-Samuelson theorem, an underlying mechanism of free-market economics, says that freer trade raises returns to the abundant facctor of production and lowers returns to the scarce once. [11] In the US, the abundant factor is capital and the scarce one is labor. Thus, according to the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, free trade increases economic inequality. [12] [13] The jobs that suffer most are those that are easily traded for cheap labor abroad. This primarily impacts low-skill workers, who either lose their job or get paid less. Of course, that means free trade hurts most Americans, as most American work the sorts of blue-collar jobs that are easily traded. So weapos;re talking about a massive impact here: a minority gets richer (and these are folks who are already rich), while the vast majority gets poorer. quot; Free trade has overall helped poor Americans. Yes, some types of jobs have been lost, but overall poor Americans are better off with free trade than without.   One example is how free trade helps job growth. The Heritage Foundation found that, quot;Today, the 12 trillion U.S. economy is bolstered by free Trade, a pillar of Americaapos;s vitality. In 2005, U.S. exports to the rest of the world totaled 1.2 trillion and supported one in five U.S. manufacturing jobs. jobs directly linked to the export of goods pay 13 percent to 18 percent more than other U.S. jobs.quot; Also, quot;The average U.S. tariff rate on all goods has fallen from over 19 percent in 1933 to 1.8 percent in 2004. As a percentage of GDP, the importance of Trade in the economy has climbed from single digits in the 1930s to nearly one-quarter of U.S. GDP in 2004. At the same time that Trade has become freer, real per capita GDP in the U.S. (in constant 2000 dollars) has climbed from a low of 5,061 in 1933 to about 36,000 in 2004.quot;  Average wages have substantially increased for every single income percentile since the start of trade liberalization. Economic inequality may have increased over time, but the free market isnapos;t a zero-sum game. Free trade benefits every that takes part in the market, rich or poor. Iapos;d rather have economic inequality and increased standards of living for the poor, than having everyone be more equal, but poorer.  http://www.heritage.org...

    <t>Free Trade Increases Innovation and Efficiency The first reason one should support free trade is because open trade with other countries leads to maximized innovation and efficiency in the economy.  The reason why there is more innovation in a free market is because businesses are forced to compete against each other on an equal playing field, which means they have to come up with ways to outcompete their competition. This results in businesses and individuals creating and employing new ideas to decrease their expenses (such as replacing a component of a machine with a cheaper material), increase the quality of their goods/services (such as making a food product taste better), and create more efficient methods to create and employ the goods/services (such as making an efficient website to ease purchases of a product).     Free Trade Lowers the Cost of Goods and Services  One of the best reasons to support free trade is the fact that it lowers the cost of  living for everyone. This happens because of the competition that I mentioned above. When companies compete without the distortion of tariffs, they are forced to provide the cheapest price possible in order to remain competitive and generate revenue.   For proof, we can look at multiple studies that prove this to be true. One study found that quot;the results of a panel covering 325 manufacturing industries from 1997 to 2006 show that imports from nine low-wage countries are associated with strong downward pressure on prices. When these nations capture a 1% share of the U.S. sector, the sectorapos;s producer prices decrease by 2.35%quot; (1)  The graph below shows how imports effect the US methanol market. (2)Free Trade Leads to Economic Growth  The term used to describe the efficiency increases as a result of free trade is called the gains of trade. Below is a graph to help visualize how the gains of trade works.(3)Or another way to look at it, one can analyze how tariffs effect the supply of a product in the graph below.(4) Other Benefits Other benefits of Free trade include: (5)  Enhances the domestic competitiveness Takes advantage of international trade technology Increase sales and profits Extend sales potential of the existing products Maintain cost competitiveness in your domestic market Enhance potential for expansion of your business Gains a global market share Reduce dependence on existing markets Stabilize seasonal market fluctuations  Sources:1.  http://www.sciencedirect.com...;2.  http://econweb.tamu.edu...3. http://welkerswikinomics.com...4. https://mrski-apecon-2008.wikispaces.com...5. http://www.economywatch.com...</t>

    <t>Yooooooo my bro varrack accepted. and btw its not just a video game, itapos;s f*cking fallout 4. us b1tces have been waiting for like 100 years for this game.1: Happiness amp; sh1t.Charity has been happin for tons of years. Charity has been widly ineffective in producing happiness in the third world. Hunger still exists, rape still exists, choclate salty candy balls are still not in the mouths of children. There are an limited amount of resources by definition charity can only help for a short time. They are prolonging the deaths of children. It is better to leave them alone and allow them develope or die on their own like evolution demands. Giving the monei to bethesda to develop fallout 4 more developlly will be better use of charity money. If you play video games it will cause very much happiness more than any child would get. These african  and cancer children wait for some aspect of hope where none will likely to be found but they can know FO4 already exists! Fallout 4 can release violant and sexual hangups that all gamers have with the violanet and sexual nature of the game. Food or cancer resarch only causes happiness for a few moments only to worry about more funding and sh1t. Fallout has so much replayability and if Bethesda releases new content each mounth the game can NEVER be completed. This will insure extreeme happiness forever.If you dont play video games, than you can learn or watch people play it on the jewtubes. It can also realse sexual hangups with vault girl cosplayshttp://i.imgur.com...; /gt;*Cough* exucuse me, I have to take a cold shower.Back. damn sexy right? With enough money going to PR tons of women that look like her will dress similar further leading to increased happiness and libedo of the male race. Ultilmatly causing more children to be born to make more FO4 content. Charity can do none of this2: culture amp; sh1tFFallout is a game bout war and necular war. seeing the world like this will cause fauture generations (caused by sexy vault girls (see above)) to not want war. They wont want to look at ugly ghouls or huge azz super mutants, they will cheresh the world today. This will cause climate change to be elimated, everyone will be too bsusy playing fallout to make any more global warming. and by teaching an apprechastion of the world will cause people to strive for an elimnation of climate change. With everyone playing fallout to get rid of sexual and violent hangups, there will therefore be no violence or rape. Unwanted pregniences will go down and wanted pregniacnies will go up. Drug addicts can cure their addiction by taking drugs on the video game relasing there urge to shoot up (or huff up jet).when mod tools are relased people will become smarter because they want to make mods to add beards, hair, beards, giant penises, and more weapons in the game. Theyll have to learn how to animate textures, and create texutres. creating a smart computer literate people who know their sh1t .This will create jobs for a megaton of people. Bethesda will have to hire millions of emploies to expand on the market. Everyone will already have qualifications3: World peaceWith everyone united by fallout 4, all the poor, sick, and hungery dead this will allow first world nations to expand and take over the countires that were home to the weak.This will create a better use for the land. Everone speaks the same laungage fallout 4 and this unites people into creating a one world government with world peace in mind. All first world nations have common ground a love of FO4 and wish to avoid what happened in fallout. Ambitions will be to help future generations, to expand our minds and fallout 4. Develope flying ships like the one in the fallout trailer to develope technology similar to falloutapos;s and to finially achive space travel in case all else fails. With the future in mind men will finillay reach the stars and create a galatic empire.All thats required is to stop giving money tf*cking charites and start giving it to bethesda</t>

    <t>Pro is obviously trolling, but since it wasnapos;t clarified that this was a troll debate then I have no choice but to take this seriously. On that note, letapos;s examine Proapos;s case. It is filled with bare assertion fallacies, non-sequiturs and personal bias that in no way actually fulfills the BoP that Pro holds.Happiness1. Pro claims that charity has been wildly ineffective. However, his reasoning for this isnapos;t sufficient. Of course there is still hunger and crime existent, but charity work has reduced that and has helped the cause by showing. Bill Gates, founder of an effective world charity, dispels the myth that foreign aid is a big waste. He states that because of help from other countries, quot;by 2035, there will be almost no poor countries left in the world.quot; [1. http://www.gatesfoundation.org...] He gives examples of how foreign has benefited third-world countries such as that a vaccine campaign in southern Africa eliminated measles as a killer of children. Polio has been mostly wiped from the world and is only prevalent in the countries of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria.[1]2. The assertion that video games cause happiness is both subjective and unfounded. Most hildren in Africa donapos;t even have access game consoles, and thereapos;s no way to determine that they would become quot;happierquot; from playing it versus being cured of malaria and taken out of poverty which charity is working to do.3. Fallout 4 has not even been released yet, so it is complete speculation to say it will cause happiness. Itapos;s release date is thought to be sometime in November 2015 [2. http://www.idigitaltimes.com...]Culture1. Just because Fallout 4 is supposedly about nuclear war doesnapos;t mean future generations will dislike war in the future....again, unfounded assumption and complete lack of evidence.2. Not everyone will be quot;too busyquot; to cause climate change because we donapos;t know how many people will abandon their important jobs to play the game. It could be a huge failure for all we know.3. Violence and unwanted pregnancies arenapos;t going to decrease. Not everyone will be playing it, and we certainly donapos;t know how many will. Same reasoning as above.4. Mod tools do not increase intelligence. Unsubstantiated claim.5. Jobs may or may not be created. No way to know for sure, and even if there is it cannot compare to charity work.World peace1. Pro asserts that everyone will be united by Fallout 4 but this argument is completely theoretical. Pro is wishing this would happen, but gives no reason for us to believe that it actually will.2. The rest of this argument is so ridiculous itapos;s not worthy of a response. Everything Pro says will happen is 100% unsupported, thus should be dismissed.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank Kryptic for accepting this debate.Correlation and CausationConsider the Cenozoic era (the last 65 million years). Overall, solar activity increased 0.4% over this period. quot;Because Earth absorbs about 240 W/m^2 of solar energy, that brightness increase is a forcing of about 1 W/m^2. This small linear increase of forcing, by itself, would have caused a modest global warming through the Cenozoic Era.quot; The CO2 levels caused a much higher forcing. In contrast, atmospheric CO2 during the Cenozoic changed from at least 1000 ppm in the early Cenozoic to as small as 170 ppm during recent ice ages. The resulting climate forcing, as can be computed accurately for this CO2 range using formulae in Table 1 of Hansen et al. (2000), exceeds 10 W/m^2. It is clear that CO2 was the dominant climate forcing in the Cenozoic.quot;[1]In fact, the temperature changes correspond to the CO2 changes. quot;...there is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr.quot;[2]This graph shows the CO2-temperature correlation over the last 700,000 years: Excess CO2 traps heat. Considering the recent global warming, satellites measure less heat escaping out to space, at the particular wavelengths that CO2 absorbs heat, thus finding quot;...direct experimental evidence for a significant increase in the Earthapos;s greenhouse effect.quot; In other words, the Earth is retaining more of the heat that it receives from the sun that it received from before. This excess heat manifests itself through global temperature increases.quot;If less heat is escaping to space, where is it going? Back to the Earthapos;s surface. Surface measurements confirm this, observing more downward infrared radiation. A closer look at the downward radiation finds moreheat returning at CO2 wavelengths,leadin to the conclusion that apos;...this experimental data should effectively end the argument by skeptics that no experimental evidence exists for the connection between greenhouse gas increases in the atmosphere and global warming.apos;quot;[3][4][5]Evidence of Mankindapos;s Influence on the Recent Global Warming TrendIt would be rather coincidental if the recent rise in global warming happened to start just around the time that humans started to emit large quantities of greenhouse gases. However, there is direct evidence as well, in addition to the already established correlation between temperature and CO2.Now, it is known that CO2 levels are increasing. quot;In pre-industrial times over the last 10,000 years, CO2 was relatively stable at around 275 to 285 parts per million. Over the last 250 years, atmospheric CO2 levels have increased by about 100 parts per million.quot; CO2 levels are increasing at a level not seen in at least 500,000 years, if not longer.[6]Here is a graph showing CO2 concentrations over the last 10000 years: [7][8]Now, carbon has several isotopes, three of which are C12, C13, and C14. C14 is radioactive, and has a half life of around 5,730 years. The CO2 emissions that humans make come from fossil fuels. Thus, if humans were the cause of the excess CO2, weapos;d except the C14/C12 ratio to decline, because, while there is a relatively constant amount of C14 in the atmosphere due to continuous replenishment (when a neutron collides with a regular nitrogen atom, a C14 atom and a proton result), the amount of C14 in the Earth has steadily decreased because it is not replenished, and since fossil fuels come from the ground, almost pure C12 is being ejected into the atmosphere. Indeed, it is observed that the C14/C12 ratio has declined. And thus, if humans were the cause of the excess CO2, weapos;d except the C13/C12 ratio to decline, because plants find it easier to take in carbon dioxide with a C12 atom than one with a C13 atom, implying that plants have a lower C13/C12 ratio than the atmopshere and, since animals eat plants (either by directly eating then or eating something that eats plants), also implying that fossils also have a lower C13/C12 ratio than the atmopshere, implying that weapos;d see a decline in the C13/C12 ratio as well. Indeed it is also observed that the C13/C12 ratio has declined.[9][10][11]This can be observed in the graph below (this is the C13/C12 ratio over the last 650 years; the C14/C12 ratio graph was too big to put in the debate):The evidence that this excess CO2 is the cause of the recent global warming is voluminous. One piece of evidence is a comparison of warming in the troposphere and stratosphere. Because the CO2 is in the upper troposphere, the troposphere temperature would increase, while the stratospheric temperature would decrease, because there would be less heat reaching the stratosphere. quot;Computer model estimates of the ‘human influence’ fingerprint are broadly similar to the observed pattern. In sharp contrast, model simulations of internal and total natural variability cannot produce the same sustained, large-scale warming of the troposphere and cooling of the stratosphere.quot;[4][12][13]This graph shows this: [4]Another piece of evidence is the frequency of cold days and nights. Because the sun only shines in the day time, is the sun was causing global warming, the days would warm faster than the nights, while if greenhouse gases were causing global warming, this wouldnapos;t be observed. It is the latterapos;s prediction that is observed. quot;What we observe is a decrease in cold nights greater than the decrease in cold days, and an increase in warm nights greater than the increase in warm days.quot;[4][14]This can be shown in the below graph: [4]Overall, the evidence shows that human-emitted greenhouse gases are the cause of global warming. CO2, in addition to other gases like methane and nitrous oxide are being emitted by humans in very large amounts, and this is manifesting itself in an increase in the average global temperature.Climate Sensitivity and FeedbacksClimate sensitivity is the amount the temperature would rise if the CO2 concentration were doubled. Obviously, if thereapos;s a large climate sensitivity, then increases in CO2 have large effect. It is known that the climate sensitivity is around 1 degree C. However, this can be amplified through feedbacks. Positive ones amplify the sensitivity, while negative ones diminish the sensitivity. The evidence overwhelmingly comes down on the former, that positive feedbacks are happening. Increases in CO2 cause temperature increases, which are amplified by water vapor and the effect on clouds.quot;Since the radiative effects associated with the buildup of water vapor to near-saturation levels and the subsequent condensation into clouds are far stronger than the equilibrium level of radiative forcing by the non-condensing GHGs, this results in large local fluctuations in temperature about the global equilibrium value.quot;[15]This can be shown in the below graph: Further, increases in CO2 affect the carbon cycle in this way:Global warming can result in the death of vegetation (due to droughts) and the warming of the ocean. Both of these further reduce the maximum absorption of the Earths carbon cycle, thus resulting in even more CO2 being released into the atmosphere. And with this, CO2 increases even more. In other words, CO2-caused temperature increases are amplified by positive feedbacks and the mechanics of the carbon cycle.So, the positive feedback amplifies the climate sensitivity. How much it is amplified can be determined through study. Using a Bayesian statistical approach, which is “the dominant [method] in the literature”, these findings support the notion of climate sensitivity as maximum 4 degrees C, a mean of 3 degrees C, and likely not lower than 3 degrees.[16]The graph below gives a statistical analysis:[17]The mean is around 3 degrees C. The CO2 that humans emit thus has an effect of 3 degrees C per doubling of CO2. This can be shown by the fact that CO2 concentrations have increased from around 275 ppm to around 400 ppm. This is an increase of around 40%. This should manifest itself with a temperature increase of a little less than 1.5 degrees C. Indeed, temperatures have increased around this amount over the last 150 years. The anthropogenic-forcing climate models thus match observations.[18]In other words, in addition to the direct evidence of how the Earth is warming, the climate models based on a greenhouse gas cause to global warming explain almost perfectly the recent global warming. This is a lot of evidence for a human case to the recent global warming.ConclusionGreenhouse gases cause global warming because of their heat trapping abilities. Humans have been emitting vast amounts of greenhouse gases over the last 150 years, and this shows itself on the CO2 measurements. The atmospheric warming pattern and greater heating at night are evidence that the recent global warming is caused by those human emitted greenhouse gases. These increases are amplified through the water vapor and cloud positive feedbacks and the positive feedback that arises through the climate cycle. The climate sensitivity ends up being around 3 degrees C. Finally, the CO2-temperature record shows that the two correlate with remarkable correlation.SourcesSources in comments.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank Kryptic for presenting his argument.I agree with the alternate definition he provided. Looking back to the definition I cited in round 1, I defined global warming as quot;...the average temperature of Earthapos;s atmosphere and oceans since the late 19th century, and its projected continuation.quot; This means that any arguments regarding natural factorsapos; effects on the climate before the late 19th century and long term climate projection of there being another ice age are irrelevant. Iapos;m not contending that natural factors have no effect on the climate, or even that they are not usually the only cause of climate change. All Iapos;m arguing is that the global warming since the late 19th century has been driven mostly by anthropogenic forcings.[1]Since my opponent provided no other arguments, all I will do in this round is show how comparing natural factors and anthropogenic factors shows that humans are the main cause of global warming.The most important of the natural climate forcings is the sun. It is the source of the Earthapos;s energy. This energy comes from the radiation emitted as a result of fusion reactions at the core of the sun. This radiation is known as the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI). Any change in the TSI causes energy imbalances on the Earth. This energy imbalance can be calculated using the formula below:Delta means change, so Delta(F) means the change in energy (i.e. energy imbalance) and Delta(TSI) means the change in solar irradiance. The 0.7 factor comes from the fact that the Earth reflects about 30% of the solar radiation it receives, and the 1/4 factor comes from spherical geometry.Changes in temperature are proportional to the energy imbalance. This can be expressed in the formula below:Lambda is the constant of proportionality, representing the climate sensitivity (discussed in my first argument) in this case.The only thing thatapos;s left is to actually determine the values. First, the change in TSI (in this case, between 1900 and 1950). quot;Although Wang, Lean, and Sheeleyapos;s reconstructionputs the change in TSIsince 1900 at about 0.5 W-m-2, previous studies have shown a larger change, so weapos;ll estimate the change in TSI at 0.5 to 2 W-m-2.quot; This corresponds to an energy imbalance of around 0.1-0.35 W-m-2. Next, the lambda factor. I explained in the last article that the statistically most probable value for the climate sensitivity was around 3 degrees C. But, there was a lot of variation. quot;Studies have given a possible range of values of 2 to 4.5°C warming for a doubling of CO2, which corresponds to a range of 0.54 to 1.2°C/(W-m-2) for λ.quot; This gives range of values from 0.05 to 0.4 degrees C, with a most probable value of 0.15 degrees C (corresponding to the statistically most likely climate sensitivity). In other words, solar activity from 1900 to 1950 raised the temperature of the Earth 0.15 degrees C.[2]Looking at the effect of CO2 emissions over that same period, humans increased the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere by about 20 parts per million, giving a range of values of 0.14-0.32 degrees C for the effect of that emission on the climate, with the most probable being 0.22 degrees C.[2]This corresponds to CO2 amounting for 60% of the warming from 1900-1950. After that, it gets higher. CO2 emissions rise exponentally, and changes in the TSI start getting less positive, and eventually become negative after 1975. quot;Therefore, the solar forcing combined with theanthropogenicCO2forcing and other minor forcings (such as decreased volcanic activity) can account for the 0.4°C warming in the early 20th century, with the solar forcing accounting for about 40% of the total warming. Over the past century, this increase inTSIis responsible for about 15-20% of global warming. But sinceTSIhasnapos;t increased in at least the past 32 years (and more like 60 years, based onreconstructions), the Sun is not directly responsible for the warming over that period.quot; Solar activity cannot account for the warming after 1975, and even before that was a smaller factor than CO2.[2]This can be shown in the image below:[3]CO2 correlates with CO2 more than solar activity, especially after 1975.There are other natural forcings, ozone concentrations and volcanic activity being the other major ones. The ozone layer of the atmosphere blocks the sunapos;s UV radiation from reaching the Earth. Lowering levels of ozone may cause warming then by allowing more solar radiation to reach the Earth. However, while ozone levels were decreasing before 1995, they are now increasing (regardless, the declining ozone levels were also caused by humans). And the volcanic activity forcing has actually had a cooling effect on the climate. quot;Foster and Rahmstorf (2011) used a multiple linear regression approach to filter out the effects of volcanic andsolar activity, and the El NiñoSouthern Oscillation(ENSO). They found that volcanic activity, as measured by aerosol optical thickness data (AOD) has only caused between 0.02 and 0.04°C per decade warming from 1979 through 2010 (Table 1, Figure 2), or about 0.06 to 0.12°C warming of the surface and lowertroposphere, repsectively, since 1979 (out of approximately 0.5°C observed surface warming).quot;[4]In total, all the forcings, both natural and anthropogenic, can be shown below:[3]Greenhouse gases are far more important than solar activity (note that sulfate levels mostly correlate with volcanic activity).ConclusionI donapos;t have anything more to say, since this is all my opponent talks about. Anthropogenic forcings were more important for global warming than natural forcings.Sources[1]: http://en.wikipedia.org...[2]: https://www.skepticalscience.com...[3]: http://solar-center.stanford.edu...[4]: https://www.skepticalscience.com...</t>

    <t>I will be debating against (Con) the idea that apos;Mankind Is the Main Cause of Global Warmingapos;, I do not doubt that we are a huge factor in this, however I am arguing that we are not the leading cause of Global Warming, or known better recently as, Climate Change.I would like to start talking about what Climate Change is.- a change in global or regional climate patterns, in particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onwards and attributed largely to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels.This is the typical definition of Climate Change for the public, the use of fossil fuels and other carbon based structures that inevitably end up in the atmosphere, making a greenhouse effect and holding in more heat. My argument is, ~ Humans and natural cycles is why we have Climate Change ~Each year through our generation of electricity through coal [4], our consumption of petrol and oil and exhaust of our transportation [3], our destruction of natural filters such as plant life, phytoplankton [1] and bodies of water [2] have made our world a slightly different place that will radically change in the near future.The science behind the principle of Climate Change is what we want to know. How does Climate Change work?If we look at the moon, the temperatures vary from -170C to 100C [5], however, on Earth we have a stronger gravity, this pulls our gaseous atmosphere closer to our planet through its mass. Gravity is a force and puts pressure on everything it can affect, as a result, everything becomes heavier; this means that the centrifugal force also applies more pressure due to the rotation of the axis [6]. Since our atmosphere is a lot closer and denser then the moons atmosphere, heat is locked in.The question now is, how the atmosphere correlates to increased heat. In order for our atmosphere to absorb radiation, it must have some electrically charged particles for passing electromagnetic waves to push around. Although most of the gasses in our atmosphere donapos;t have a negative charge, instead, they have an equal distribution between both negative and positive charges. However, there is one good part about the placement of polarity, Water (H20), Ozone (O3) and Nitrous Oxide (N2O) which all have their negatively charged particles on one side allowing infrared radiation to absorb and reflect easily.[7]Carbon Dioxide (C02) and Methane (CH4) move and shake continuously allowing the same result as the previous three elements. [8]As a result, having these gasses enables more heat to be held together leading to hotter days. I will not be going into Ozone Depletion however I will be going into how the real reason we have climate change is due to our oceans.Opening statement.The human use of elements that promote the greenhouse effect on the world has created a slight discourse in the typical cycles that would otherwise naturally occur. The waters are getting hotter, rising, and expelling carbon dioxide instead of holding it in, this has occurred in the past naturally without human intervention, the natural filters are being removed and as a result, more carbon dioxide is entering our atmosphere enabling Climate Change. This is the man made climate change that will affect the patterns of temperature cycles that have been happening for the last 4.5 billion years. Mankind is affecting the part of repair or restoration within natural filters. If we look at graphs that are 542 million years ago, we can see a general pattern, we are about to go into a cold spell soon too. The next ice age is on its way. Currently I have no option to upload the graph so I will post it in the reference. I do apologise for my incredibly short argument, it’s really late, and I did not have much time to work on this.

I withdraw my argument and forfeit.  Thanks for the debate so far, I would of totally kept the debate going if it was something I could persist with and have a drive of showing that I was in fact correct. but there is simply no evidence suggesting anything other than man has caused an over abundance of natural gases that has resulted in a process we call climate change.  if I continued this debate and got people on my side, I could not forgive my self for apos;uneducatingapos; people :P. it would be a disgrace to my growth in science and what I stand for.

    <t>C1) Climate sensitivity is likely high  Climate sensitivity is the key argument to this debate. Everyone agrees that CO2 has some direct effect, at least 1 degree C per doubling of CO2 concentration. This is what former climate modeler turned skeptic David Evans argues. “[All] serious skeptical scientists have always agreed with the government climate scientists about the direct effect of CO2. The argument is entirely about the feedbacks.” [1]  What are feedbacks? Feedbacks are important because they tell us how much warming we will have in the future. They amplify -- or dampen -- the warming effect of CO2. Changes in albedo, cloud cover, water vapor, and greenage can all affect warming.  If sensitivity is 2-3 degrees C, CO2 can explain most of the warming since the late 70s. If it is lower it still causes a significant amount. My opponent needs to pretty much argue that the amplification effects are under one in order to win.   Let us assume that climate sensitivity is low. Say, feedbacks are around zero (no positive or negative feedbacks);  every doubling of CO2 leads to roughly 1.1 degrees C increase in temperature. Even this unrealistically low climate sensitivity does not harm the AGW hypothesis. Nir Al Shaviv, a skeptical physicist, wrote a paper assuming the feedback effect was 1.1 degrees. He calculated that CO2 actually caused slightly over half of the modern warming trend [2] (about 57%). The famous Lindzen and Choi (and Spencer) results are really the only ones which cast doubt on the fact that CO2 is responsible for the warming. But Nir Al Shaviv told me in an email, “[m]y best estimate is that the sensitivity is higher than Lindzen and Choi, actually closed to no net amplifier, with the 50% of the CO2 doubling, the Anthropogenic contribution is also around 50%.” [3] Essentially, he verified what I sent to him in an email with calculations I had done assuming the amplifier was flat. My data found that it caused about 49.5% of the warming, but I failed to take into account the logarithmic effect of CO2, which makes the effect over 50%.   Even then, these assumptions are incorrect. Sensitivity is higher, and if it is, CO2 pretty much causes far more than 50% of the warming, but both estimates are enough to win me the debate. Research by Patrick Michaels, now a libertarian, CATO scholar found the amplifier to be 1.6 degrees C [4]. More than the 1.1 above. This puts the man made contribution to global warming above 50%, and certainly above 57%. This is not even including other gases which amplify the greenhouse effect.   The burgeoning evidence suggests that the net amplifier is around 2-3 degrees C. Based on multiple lines of evidence, stemming from volcanic eruptions, instrumental records, paleoclimatology, and more, the mean sensitivity sits firmly at about 3 degrees C. The following picture demonstrates the evidence.     As seen, the average never dips below 2 degrees C. The mean is 2 - 4.5 degrees C, all of which are enough for me to win the debate. 2 degrees C probably puts you around 70% of the warming is due to CO2, and 3 at nearly 100%, though I have not done the math (yet…). Some studies find fairly high sensitivity, around 4 degrees C. JD Annan, a leading climatologist, uses a Bayesian statistical technique, the predominant methodology in both the skeptic and realist literature. He found a mean sensitivity of 3 degrees C, with upper estimates at 4 degrees C, though still possible, but very unlikely below 3 degrees C [5].   The following graph [6], which I like because since I have used it pretty much everyone else has stolen it, shows the results from 3 leading studies. Although the results are uncertain, they are certain in that sensitivity is above 2 degrees C.     A new paper, published in 2012, actually went against the consensus and found low sensitivity. Despite this, their results concluded that “[h]umanity is . . . responsible for the most recent period of warming from 1976 to 2010.” [7]  Sensitivity is high. That means I win the debate. If it is low, I still win the debate because it caused 50% of more of the modern warm period.   C2) Evidence from paleoclimatology   I love paleoclimatology. I like geology and come from a family of geologists who are also oil entrepenueres (maybe why I still have skeptic leanings). And pretty solid evidence in the paleoclimatological record actually shows a strong CO2 effect. I am just going to c/p my debate with Roy.   There is significant evidence from paleoclimate records that CO2 can have an effect on changes in the climate. Climate skeptic and paleoclimatologist Bob Carter emphasizes the importance of paleoclimate data. He compares climate to a piece of string. The current instrumental data (1850 – present) is a very short period of time, according to Carter. And when the ‘string’ is lengthened, we see a lot of climactic variability. Instead of looking at the recent past, we should look at the entire temperature record in order to get an accurate picture of the climate [8]. I will provide evidenc, contrary to what Carter believes, lengthening the string supports AGW theory.  Over the Cenozoic Era, which began 66 million years ago, we see clear warming and cooling cycles caused by changes in CO2 concentrations. The sun increased slightly over that time period, whereas temperatures cooled. CO2, however, fell steadily through that time period. Plate tectonics was also accounted for. With natural forcings an unlikely cause, “CO2 was the dominant climate forcing in the Cenozoic” [9].  When you lengthen the ‘string’ over the course of the entire Phanerozoic (500 million years; begins at the Cambrian) there is still evidence of CO2 driving multiple climate changes. The GEOCARB study, published in 2001, is one of the definitive proxy records for CO2 concentrations within the last 500 million years. The study notes that “over the long term there is indeed a correlation between CO2 and paleotemperature” [10].  Evidence from the Vostok ice cores (specifically 240,000 before present), proves that CO2 has had an effect on temperatures. Although the initial forcing was orbital changes in the sun, CO2 “plays . . . a key role in amplifying the initial orbital forcing” and “the CO2 increase clearly precedes the Northern Hemisphere deglaciation”. The study also notes that these forcings “are also at work for the present-day and future climate” [11].  There is also proof that it is warmer now than it has been since the MWP. In fact, it is warmer now than any year since 1400 AD [12]. Newer reconstructions continue to support this finding, and even extends the dataset. It finds that the Roman warm period (RWP) and the MWP as much cooler than today, and claims to have replicated previous ‘hockey stick’ studies [19]. The results are depicted below.    Looking into the geologic past, we see strong evidence in favor of the idea that carbon dioxide can increase temperature. It logically follows that if humans continue to emit CO2, and other greenhouse gasses, that human emissions will increase temperatures.  C3) Consensus  Before I continue, I would like to note this argument in and of itself does not prove that global warming is caused by man. Actual evidence should be the driving force behind this debate. The reason I chose to put this in my argument is simple: the science is not clear because of consensus, but a consensus exists because the evidence is clear. This evidence will be discussed later.  A study published in Science reviewed the ISI web of science in order to take a survey of relevant climate literature as to what the causes of climate change are. The study failed to find a single paper which was in opposition to the consensus position, that the main driver of climate change is anthropogenic. 75% of the papers supported the consensus position, whereas 25% had no position (they were focused on things other than forgings, like impacts or paleoclimate) [14]. The study also noted how many organizations have come out supporting the idea of anthropogenic climate change. The IPCC, the American Meteorological Society, American Geophysical Union, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science have all concluded that the evidence for AGW is overwhelming [15].  NASA furthers this argument, noting “most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position”. They also argue “[n]inety-seven percent of climate scientists agree that climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities” [16].  A 196 page report representing 13 governmental agencies, and written by 28 authors from scientific institutions, has stated “[t]he global warming of the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced increases in heat-trapping gases” [17].  1. https://mises.org... 2. http://www.phys.huji.ac.il... 3.

    <t>In R1 global warming was defined as an average increase in temperature since the late 19th century. We have caused pretty much all of the warming since 1976 and a significant percent of the pre-1940 warming, with a cooling spell between the late 40s to early 70s because of human aerosol emissions and a decline in TSI.  King’s entire argument is… paleoclimate. But I don’t have to prove that we caused warming 500 million years ago, only since around 1870 or so. Paleoclimatology does have an application in this debate: whether or not CO2 causes (or doesn’t cause) past climate changes is important. It can prove whether or not CO2 has any influence on the climate. My opponent’s conclusion — that I have to prove changes before the industrial revolution — breaks rule 6, and warrants an automatic merit loss. I will refute the case anyway, but only the relevant details:  A) Phanerozoic temperature record  King shows us a graph plotting temperature and CO2 throughout the phanerozoic eon, and tells us that there is no correlation. For at least the last few thousand years, CO2 has had a strong impact on climate [1].  Unfortunately,King’s graph uses a study which I preempted. It must be noted that the graph my opponent uses does not show the error bars, so any correlation (or non correlation) is uncertain at best. And, as I argued last round, the man who made the graph (GEOCARB; Berner 2001) actually says that there exists a long term correlation between temperature and carbon dioxide [2].  Berner’s study also fails to take into account saturation effects. When this is accounted for, the correlation between CO2 and temperature is almost perfect [3].  So, the second graph my opponent uses is blatantly incorrect. Not only do the authors of the data say that I am correct, not only do the error bars tell us that the results are not really with my opponent, but a separate analysis *improving* the methodology finds a nearly *perfect* correlation between CO2 and temperature.  B) More recent temperature changes  The graph my opponent uses seems like a sketchy-tabloid esque graph. There is no reason to trust it. The data is not so cut and dry, especially because data exists showing that temperatures are warmer — not cooler — than temperatures within the past 1000 years [4].  And the timescale king uses is cherry picked. Using the past 65 million years, CO2 is the predominant climate forcing of temperature changes [5]. Research focusing on the past few interglacials — which includes king’s graph — has concluded that CO2 “plays . . . a key role in amplifying the initial orbital forcing.” [6]  Plus, the graph king uses does not take into account other forcings. Of course other factors exist in climate — I am not arguing that CO2 is the only one, only that is can be (and is) a forcing since about 1870. Climate changes in response to whatever forcing exists at that date and time. And today, CO2 is driving climate. Just like how short term (volcanoes) and long-term (GCR fluctuations) can all affect climate, CO2 has *always* played *some* role in climate. On some timescales, it is dominant [3][4]. Merely because climate has changed for other reasons does not mean that humans have no effect. Most of the time, it is not a gun which kills a person, but it would be wrong to conclude that guns do not kill. Just because climate has changed before does not necessarily mean that our change is natural.

    <t>IntroductionThis debate is about if Climate change is anthropomorphic (man made) in origin (the start). I am negating this.Note: this is not semantics,as these are the common understandings of the topic.To claim that changes in the climate from over 4000 years ago is caused by humans is quite ridiculous.Climate change has been happening for millions of years. Saying it has on balance, been caused by humans is false.http://lovecraftzine.com...http://www.nhm.ac.uk...We have only been around 200,000 years. To put that into perspective, we have only been on Earth for a minute compared to total Earth time.

    <t>First off, THANK YOU! I am very excited to have this debate, and I hope it goes well.This debate assumes that climate change has happened over the past centuries, and that over that period of time there has been a overall increase in global temperatures. So yes, I think. Before we start I would like to present these following facts/opinion that I humbly ask my opponent and voters to count as truth in this debate. As of now, current levels of CO2 are around 400 parts per million, give or take a little. Another is that most scientists who believe in Antropogenic Warming think that global temperatures will increase by 2-4 degrees C by the end of the century. Finally, most of said Anthropogenic Global Warming is caused by release of CO2 according to most scientists who believe in this form of warming. Make any changes or additions to this list as you see fit, also while some of these are opinions I ask that in this debate we consider them truths. If you disagree please make it be known in you speech, and provide counter quot;truths.quot; Lets Begin! Arguments that Contradict and Disprove the Idea of Anthropogenic Global Warming 18 Year Equalibrium: In this argument we will examine the fact that there has been no warming for 18 years and 4 months. (actually 6, but site is one month old)  From December 1996-March 2015 there has been no global warming as shown in the average. This really is shocking in the grand scheme of things because this proves that despite the world blasting carbon into the air, there has been no change in average temperature. This completely contradicts what Pro-antropogenic Global Warming scientists believe, meaning that they have prodicted it all incorrectly. 30000 Scientists: In this argument we look at the MASSIVE number of scientists that oppose the idea of Anthropogenic Global Warming. A petition has been cycling has aquired 31,487 scientists who reject the idea of Antropogenic Global Warming, 9,029 of those individuals have a PHD. An argument of the oppisate side is that there is a concensus amongst scientists that Global Warming is caused, but these numbers clearly destroy this notion. When we have this many scientists, especially those with PHDs, who say that global warming is not caused by human activities and any quot;evidencequot; that says otherwise is false, you must assume that something simply is not correct with the opposing arguments. Antarctic/Arctic Ice: In this argument we will examine the fact that Antarctic Ice has hit all time records and the fact that Arctic Ice rebounded by 50% from 2012-2013.   Antarctic Ice hit its all time record in 2014, surpassing the 20 million square millimeter mark. The antarctic ice has been increasing by about 18,900 square kilometers since recording first began. Increase in this ice has been occuring for several years, and in the past few years have been making new records while Arctic Ice on the other hand has been struggling. I frankly will be the first to admit it, however I will LOUDLY proclaim the fact that it has been making comebacks. From 2012 to 2013 Arctic ice rebounded by 50%. This means that despite this quot;global warming,quot; ice continued to increase. So basically during this time period, both the arctic and antarctic ice increased, despit increased CO2 which should have caused an increase in temperature. Even though Arctic Ice had been shrinking, the fact that it increased speaks volumes to what is really happening.   Ice Age: In this argument we will examine an ice age that occured whis CO2 levels were signifigantly higher than they are today. s://stevengoddard.files.wordpress.com...; alt=quot;quot; width=quot;640quot; height=quot;404quot; /gt;  (this graph shows the Atmoshperic Carbon Levels and Average Global Temperatures from around 600 million years ago till today) As this graph clearly depicts that at around the 450 million year mark Earth went into a HUGE ice age. However during this time CO2 Levels were at a little more than 4000 ppm. 4000! This means that Earth was experiencing and ice age while the CO2 levels were more than 10 times what they are today. Now the fact is: if what some scientists are saying is true, and CO2 has the power to raise the temperature of the planet by 2-4 degrees by the end of century, then this simply should not have happend. The is conclusion is this: CO2 does not have an impact on global temperatures because there have been cases in past where huge opposites have occured that simply should not have happened according to opposing scientists.  Flawed Arguments of the Opposing Side  97% Consensus: This argument examines the often sited 97% consesus of scientists that believe global warming is real and is caused by human activities and is dangerous.  This study was run by one person and a couple friends who supposably read over 10,000 papers, and said that 97% endorsed the idea that global warming is human caused, and dangerous. However, a professor and 3 coauthors went back through and looked at these papers and saw that this was simply not the case. In fact, they found that only 0.3% of these papers supported the idea. Therefore we can conclude that the 97% consensus is false. The reason you believe the professor is because he is a professor. The other individual was a blogger, who to the extent of my knowledge did not have these types of credentials and could not have made better conclusions than the proffesor.   Weather:  In this argument we examine how arguments about weather are completely unjustified.  Tornados are at an all time low. These past three years have seen signifigantly less tornadic events than any other year since monitoring in the 1950s. Major hurricanes have been at or bellow average for the past 50 years, whereas the before years before that had substantially more with only one year that was below average.    The above graph shows that droughts have been very stable over the past few years, despite the idea that the Earth should heating up. In fact there has been no signifigant changes with number of droughts or their severity, so any argumnet that droughts are increasing is just false. The opposing argument often points bad weather and says quot;Ha! Here! We told you this would happen!.quot; But the fact is, bad weather happens, and we should not assume the globe is warming just because some bad weather happens here and there.     Climate Models: This argument looks at the climate models that the pro-Anthropogenic Climate Scientists.   A former NASA scientist has examined the climate models and found that of those he examined, 95% of thes overcasted actual warming for years, meaning that they have been wrong time and time agian about what the global temperature SHOULD have been. I will tie this into another point, and that is that almost all predictions made by pro-Anthropogenic Global Warming scientists have been WRONG! By now the ice caps should be MELTED! Polar bears should be drowning! However as shown above this was simply proven to be completely false.   Hockeystick Graph: This argument examines the often sited quot;Hockeystick Graph.quot;   No specific site for this one, I just know about it. So the problem with the graph is that it is a cherrypicked portion of global temperatures on Earth, and if we looked at centuries prior we would see similar, if not higher Temperature Levels without added CO2 by humans. So basically it is more of a scare tactic than actual proof of Anthropogenic Global Warming.     THANK YOU so much for debating me, and I appologize if I did everything wrong, but this is part of the reason I am doing this so if you could just give me some tips and corrections I would be most appreciative. Also, the quot;truthsquot; at the top probabaly should have been stated at the beginning, so I appologize for that.   http://townhall.com...  www.petitionproject.org/index.php  https://stevengoddard.wordpress.com... http://www.alaskapublic.org... http://www.nasa.gov... http://www.washingtonpost.com... http://news.nationalgeographic.com... http://www.wsj.com... http://www.weather.com... http://www.forbes.com... http://www.climatechangedispatch.com...</t>

    <t>I thank Kylar for accepting this debate.   C1) Climate Sensitivity amp; Feedbacks  My first contention is to demonstrate CO2 has effects in rising the mean land-sea temperature. Climate sensitivity is the level of hypothetical temperature rise if the concentration of atmospheric CO2 would double. [1] It is not a much debated fact that the temperature rise would be by 1 degrees C. This, though, can be amplified by feedbacks. Positive feedbacks amplify the temperature rise, and negative feedbacks diminish the temperature rise.   A study published in Climate Research proved that the mean climate sensitivity is approximately 1 to 1.6 degrees Celsius due to the level of positive feedbacks. [2] Another significant body of research notes that climate sensitivity is likely much higher. A review of the evidence in 2008 finds that mean climate sensitivity is 3 degrees C, with a range of 2 – 4.5 degrees C. Nearly every study taken discovers the average climate sensitivity is 3 degrees C. [3]    The above graph demonstrates the effect of upper fluctuations in equilibrium temperature via. feedbacks. [4]    The graph shown above was from a 2007 research that places approximate mean climate sensitivity to double CO2 concentration at around 2.5 - 3. [5]   It is a well known fact that industrial emissions have major impact on the concentration levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. “In pre-industrial times over the last 10,000 years, CO2 was relatively stable at around 275 to 285 parts per million. Over the last 250 years, atmospheric CO2 levels have increased by about 100 parts per million.” [6]   Thus, human-caused amplified climate sensitivity affects mean land-sea temperature.   C2) Human-Emitted Greenhouse Gases  There is a documented rise in CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere over the last 250 years, with a 100 ppm increase in industrial times *alone*, versus a 50 ppm increase from 9,750 years prior. Below is a graph showing the rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. [7-8]    It is a well-known fact that majority of increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations is caused by humans. This is because of the sudden hike during industrial times alone. [6] CO2 is known to form an atmospheric layer and trap heat within the atmosphere, thus increasing the mean temperature via. the greenhouse effect, wherein insolation and terrestrial radiation are both trapped within the atmosphere. [9-10]   Below is a graph showing a correlation in the rise in temperature and rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations.     “[T]here is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr.” [11]   The CO2-temperature correlation is also influenced by CO2’s impact on solar radiation itself. In the Cenozoic era, there was a rise in solar activity due to CO2. “Because Earth absorbs about 240 W/m^2 of solar energy, that brightness increase is a forcing of about 1 W/m^2. This small linear increase of forcing, by itself, would have caused a modest global warming through the Cenozoic Era.quot; The CO2 levels caused a much higher forcing. In contrast, atmospheric CO2 during the Cenozoic changed from at least 1000 ppm in the early Cenozoic to as small as 170 ppm during recent ice ages. The resulting climate forcing, as can be computed accurately for this CO2 range using formulae in Table 1 of Hansen et al. (2000), exceeds 10 W/m^2. It is clear that CO2 was the dominant climate forcing in the Cenozoic.” [12]   There is proof that it is warmer now than any year of human life since 1400. This is depicted in the graph below. [13]      Conclusion  Thus, I have presented two valid contentions as to why global warming is man-made. Con must present contentions of their own in the next round and defend theirs in the round after. The resolution is resoundingly affirmed.

    <t>I thank my friend for this debate and I am sorry for the mix-up. Now to post arguments:  How did global warming discussions end up hinging on whatapos;s happening with polar bears, unverifiable predictions of what will happen in a hundred years, and whether people are quot;climate deniersquot; or quot;global warming cultists?quot; If this is a scientific topic, why arenapos;t we spending more time discussing the science involved? Why arenapos;t we talking about the evidence and the actual data involved? Why arenapos;t we looking at the predictions that were made and seeing if they match up to the results? If this is such an open and shut case, why are so many people who care about science skeptical? Many Americans have long since thought that the best scientific evidence available suggested that man wasnapos;t causing any sort of global warming. However, now, we can go even further and suggest that the planet isnapos;t warming at all.  1) There hasnapos;t been any global warming since 1997: If nothing changes in the next year, weapos;re going to have kids who graduate from high school who will have never seen any quot;global warmingquot; during their lifetimes. Thatapos;s right; the temperature of the planet has essentially been flat for 17 years. This isnapos;t a controversial assertion either. Even the former Director of the Climate Research Unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia, Phil Jones, admits that itapos;s true. Since the planet was cooling from 1940-1975 and the upswing in temperature afterward only lasted 22 years, a 17 year pause is a big deal. It also begs an obvious question: How can we be experiencing global warming if thereapos;s no actual quot;global warming?quot;  2) There is no scientific consensus that global warming is occurring and caused by man: Questions are not decided by quot;consensus.quot; In fact, many scientific theories that were once widely believed to be true were made irrelevant by new evidence. Just to name one of many, many examples, in the early seventies, scientists believed global cooling was occurring. However, once the planet started to warm up, they changed their minds. Yet, the primary quot;scientificquot; argument for global warming is that there is a quot;scientific consensusquot; that itapos;s occurring. Setting aside the fact thatapos;s not a scientific argument, even if that ever was true (and it really wasnapos;t), itapos;s certainly not true anymore. Over 31,000 scientists have signed on to a petition saying humans arenapos;t causing global warming. More than 1000 scientists signed on to another report saying there is no global warming at all. There are tens of thousands of well-educated, mainstream scientists who do not agree that global warming is occurring at all and people who share their opinion are taking a position grounded in science.  3) Arctic ice is up 50% since 2012: The loss of Arctic ice has been a big talking point for people who believe global warming is occurring. Some people have even predicted that all of the Arctic ice would melt by now because of global warming. Yet, Arctic ice is up 50% since 2012. How much Arctic ice really matters is an open question since the very limited evidence we have suggests that a few decades ago, there was less ice than there is today, but the same people who thought the drop in ice was noteworthy should at least agree that the increase is important as well.  4) Climate models showing global warming have been wrong over and over: These future projections of what global warming will do to the planet have been based on climate models. Essentially, scientists make assumptions about how much of an impact different factors will have; they guess how much of a change there will be and then they project changes over time. Unfortunately, almost all of these models showing huge temperature gains have turned out to be wrong.  Former NASA scientist Dr. Roy Spencer says that climate models used by government agencies to create policies quot;have failed miserably.quot; Spencer analyzed 90 climate models against surface temperature and satellite temperature data, and found that more than 95 percent of the models quot;have over-forecast the warming trend since 1979, whether we use their own surface temperature dataset (HadCRUT4), or our satellite dataset of lower tropospheric temperatures (UAH).quot; Thereapos;s an old saying in programming that goes, quot;Garbage in, garbage out.quot; In other words, if the assumptions and data you put into the models are faulty, then the results will be worthless. If the climate models that show a dire impact because of global warming arenapos;t reliable -- and theyapos;re not -- then the long term projections they make are meaningless.  5) Predictions about the impact of global warming have already been proven wrong: The debate over global warming has been going on long enough that weapos;ve had time to see whether some of the predictions people made about it have panned out in the real world. For example, Al Gore predicted all the Arctic ice would be gone by 2013. In 2005, the Independent ran an article saying that the Artic had entered a death spiral.  Scientists fear that the Arctic has now entered an irreversible phase of warming which will accelerate the loss of the polar sea ice that has helped to keep the climate stable for thousands of years....The greatest fear is that the Arctic has reached a quot;tipping pointquot; beyond which nothing can reverse the continual loss of sea ice and with it the massive land glaciers of Greenland, which will raise sea levels dramatically. Of course, the highway is still there. Meanwhile, Arctic ice is up 50% since 2012. James Hansen of NASA fame predicted that the West Side Highway in New York would be under water by now because of global warming.  If the climate models and the predictions about global warming arenapos;t even close to being correct, wouldnapos;t it be more scientific to reject hasty action based on faulty data so that we can further study the issue and find out whatapos;s really going on?

    <t>Observations  Ob1: Under “Full Resolution”, it clearly says the existence of GW is assumed, and Con must show that it is not man-made. This is violated by Con, but I shall rebut it nonetheless.   Ob2: Once more, Con’s entire case is C/P’d from his source (albeit the source is presented this time), thus there are no original arguments presented by Con.   Ob3: Con violates the debate structure by dropping ALL my arguments. I extend all my arguments to this round.   Rebuttals  R1) Global Warming Exists  According to NASA’s GISS surface temperature analysis, the global mean land-sea temperature rose from 1980 to 2014 by 0.8 degrees Celsius, and the corresponding graph shows a constant increase in temperature throughout the years from 1980 to 2014 [1].     The alleged 17-year pause is incorrect, as there has been a 0.8 degrees C increase in temperature. The global land-sea average temperature in December 2014 was the highest monthly land-sea average in 135 years [2]. There have been major temperature anomalies throughout December 2014 itself [3].    R2) Scientific Consensus  A study published in Science reviewed the ISI web of science in order to take a survey of relevant climate literature as to what the causes of climate change are. The study failed to find a single paper which was in opposition to the consensus position, that the main driver of climate change is anthropogenic. 75% of the papers supported the consensus position, whereas 25% had no position (they were focused on things other than forgings, like impacts or paleoclimate) [4]. “[T]he National Academy of Sciences report, Climate Change Science: An Analysis of Some Key Questions, begins: “Greenhouse gases are accumulating in Earthapos;s atmosphere as a result of human activities, causing surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise.” [4-5] A 196 page report representing 13 governmental agencies, and written by 28 authors from scientific institutions, has stated “[t]he global warming of the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced increases in heat-trapping gases …” [6] According to NASA, “[n]inety-seven percent of climate scientists agree that climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities.” [7]     Above is a graph presented by 4 major institutes that have taken a study on the temperature anomaly, and the results from NASA, MOHC/CRU, NOAA Climatic Data Center, and the Japanese Meteorological Agency have almost identical results [7].   R3) Arctic Ice  Con concedes that this is irrelevant to the issue, and this is merely a prediction made by some supporters of global warming, thus I need not address this. Nonetheless, I wish to point out that “[t]he European Space Agency’s CryoSat mission has returned its latest map of Arctic sea ice volumes, recording a slight decrease in thickness over previous measurements.” [8]   R4) Climate Models  While climate models may have been wrong, they were only predictions of the increase. A certain level of increase happened nonetheless, and that is relevant to the resolution, while this is completely irrelevant to the resolution.   R5) Predictions  This is a repeat of “Climate Models” and “Arctic Ice”. The current data is not faulty unless proven otherwise, thus this argument is useless and irrelevant.   I sincerely request Con to frame his own argument for the next round instead of C/Ping it.   Arguments  ALL my arguments are dropped. I extend all my arguments.

    <t>I accept your debate, pro! Now, there is a good deal of evidence that humans are not causing global warming at all. It was simply America heeding Al Goreapos;s warnings based on misguided interpretations of scientific studies. Our planet has a natural cycle of heating up and cooling back down. In fact, from 1940 to 1975, quot;global coolingquot; was the big issue, but that scientific theory was discovered to be false. You can read about global cooling here: http://www.newscientist.com...  This isnapos;t just an ignorant, uneducated viewpoint; thousands of scientists have signed a petition claiming that humans arenapos;t causing global warming (http://www.petitionproject.org...). A lot of environmentalists claim that because there is a scientific consensus and all sorts of graphs and charts, global warming is definitely real. That isnapos;t how questions are answered. A lot of scientific theories were widely accepted by the public in the past were suddenly made irrelevant with new evidence.  Itapos;s widely believed that global warming is causing Arctic ice to melt. Mysteriously, the Arctic ice cap has expanded by 50% since 2012: http://www.dailymail.co.uk... Also, the climate models created by skilled scientists, who canapos;t even accurately predict when it will rain half of the time, have been wrong over and over. Read here: http://dailycaller.com... As many as 95% of them have proven inaccurate. There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will cause catastrophic heating of the Earthquot;s atmosphere.  But letapos;s just say that if global warming theorists were right, which they are not in many cases, what would happen if the Earth became filled up with the greenhouse effect? It has happened bFefore in the Earthapos;s history, in the Ordovician period 440 million years ago. The carbon dioxide concentration was up by a whopping 16 times that of today. The planet still supported plenty of flora and fauna, so the environment certainly wasnapos;t in danger. (http://en.wikipedia.org...) These carbon dioxide emissions were caused by mass volcanic activity, and they were eventually brought down by the same thing, volcanic activity. Global warming is not being caused by humans, and there is no clear or present danger because of it.</t>

    <t>Very well, here are my closing thoughts. I do believe that global warming exists, and I must correct you: my argument was not that global warming will have no repercussions on the environment at all. My argument was that it wonapos;t be as severe as the quot;doomsdayquot; scientists predict will come very soon. Though arguments from your side of the spectrum are very much based in fact and science, it should be at least acknowledged that in the end, humans are prone to error, including scientists, and they cannot predict the future. This is a simple truth that I canapos;t really cite sources for. Itapos;s a shrewd quality to be cautious for the worst possible outcome, but it shouldnapos;t gain so much attention in politics. The United States government, however, spends around 20 billion for both global warming and nuclear weapons, relatively equal. While trying to protect the planet in all of its natural beauty in a noble cause, itapos;s simply not realistic to spend billions of dollars on it. Instead, the government should be focusing on education, military, and law enforcement: issues that are relevant and short-term. To conclude, global warming exists, but is not grave or tangible enough to be treated as a serious issue in the politics of todayapos;s world.  Good luck, Pro. Thank you for a good debate.

    <t>Panicking of environmentalists about climate change is based on future projections and speculation, nearly all of which have turned out to be wrong. Humans may be contributing to shifts in the Earthapos;s temperature. Al Gore claimed that by 2012, Antarctica would be completely melted due to global warming. What melting-ice-caps activists fail to realize is that most of Antarcticaapos;s ice is already underwater. When you put a piece of ice in a glass of water, it raises slightly, does it not? And when that ice melts, does the water level raise? No, because it has already been displaced by the ice. The ocean works by those rules, and there is no danger of a global flood.  Another fault in environmentalist logic is their emphasis on how humans are the only reason global warming could possibly happen. Humans do have an affect on the environment, of course. But their impact is relatively small, because natural cycles and extinction events will happen whether or not fossil fuels are being burned. Even if humanity makes no attempt to switch to a different energy source, temperature will only rise a few degrees Celsius. Effects of this would be minor, certainly not helping to spread diseases, droughts, or smog. Even less likely is a mass extinction event.

    <t>Yes I agree that the Earths temperature is rising, that is no secret.I just do not belive that global warming is the reason why.My six propositions of alternate climate change are,The bio-thermostat theorem- that the co2 being placed in the atmosphere is causing natural changes in the output/input of carbon dioxide in plants and animals such as algea, also another possible theorem to add to this is the increasing birth rate of cows, who can produce enought carbon dioxide and methane to fill up a jar the size of Rhode island, source, animals.howstuffworks.com/cowscarbon.More alternate theories of climate change is the albedo and cloud fromation, this one is short, chnages in the formation of albedo clouds can create a negative feedbacks that cancel out all or nearly all of warming effect of higher level of co2.-humans forcing the greenhouse effect alternate to greenhouse gases, that the greatest influence on climate is the transformation of Earths surface, like the creating of deserts and the cutting of the rainforests.-ocean currents, natural changes in the Earths mantle is cause the current of the oceans to move at different speeds or chnage direction all together, the theory states how the natural process of algea is being adapted to the new formation of currents and is a prime factor in the realese of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.-Planetary motion, natural gravitational and magnetic oscillations of the solar system induced by the planets movement through space can dribe climate change and naturaly effect the Earths magnetic field.-Solar variability - changes in the coronal ejections and magnetic fields of the sun causes changes in the cloud formation, ocean currents, and win that can cause climate change.This is just a note not a arguement: At first, people where afraid that the earth was going to be placed in another iceage because of Co2 not in a rising temperature.</t>

A jar the size of Rhode Island would be 2-D 3.

    <t>A significant tip of the hat to Con for their respect and generosity. Nice to know that religious debates still have the capacity to end on a professional note. Letapos;s do it again sometime (preferably when Iapos;m not under a thousand deadlines)! As all the following points are directed specifically at Christianity, I will approach my rebuttals from that perspective as far as my character limit will allow (which is less than I would like, sadly). First of all, religion is not as simple as weapos;d all like it to be, and as such, it needs to be handled carefully. Itapos;s safe to say that people who have spent their entire lives studying the biblical texts, thousands of years of exegesis, theology, and hermeneutics, and careful examination of the bibleapos;s original culture, heritage, treatment, languages, and context are going to know a lot more about how Christianity should be practiced than the average soccer mom or politician. Just like an actual medical scientist with a degree and ten years of university education is going to know a lot more about vaccines than a talk show host. Itapos;s the churchapos;s job to communicate its truths just like itapos;s the medical communityapos;s job to communicate its truths (although there will invariably be dissent in both camps on certain issues, and one cannot guarantee that the masses will listen). If the church has failed in this commission, thatapos;s hardly the fault of Christianity itself, which actually condemns failure to properly instruct. Credit where credit is due. Con asks the question of what makes someone an extremist. My definition of an extremist is someone who takes an idea farther than it was meant to go, and subsequently causes harm. This can apply to religion, politics, civil rights... any opinion one has passion for, which is why we must be careful not to appeal to our emotions before we have considered our reasoning.  “from my personal experience, religion never does what it claims (makes people kinder or more moral).”  From my personal experience, religion never fails to do so. To each their own?  “The idea that the Old Testament is somehow quot;null and voidquot; because of the quot;new covenantquot; is not biblically supportable (in fact, Jesus is quoted as saying that he comes not to change the [Mosaic] law) and will offend a significant number of Christians; are they extremists?” There are a few problems with Conapos;s statement. Firstly, I never actually said that the Old Testament is null and void in Christianity. I said that the old covenant is. They are not the same thing. Secondly, what Jesus says in Matthew 5 is “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.” The word “change” does not appear in any translation Iapos;ve been able to find, so saying Jesus is “quoted” as saying it is a bit of an exaggeration. Christapos;s sacrifice fulfilled the law and established a new covenant with all people. This covenant was built on the foundations of the old one, which is why many of the moral precepts in the Old Testament (the ten commandments, for instance) are still applicable, but the laws concerning what is clean and unclean, or laws discussing the judicial punishments for sin in the nation of Israel, etc., are not. My original point still stands. Any Christians who believe that the entire Mosaic law still applies to them have hugely misunderstood their theology (and seeing how few of them are willing to actually follow the 900+ laws contained therein, Iapos;d say we have a hypocrisy problem as well). quot;I know this: families are literally torn apart because a son is gay; that sentence needs correction: families are literally torn apart because they are religious; homosexuality is not a choice, religion is.quot; I am unaware of a single passage of Scripture that endorses the appalling treatment of homosexuals that the church has engaged in. I am, however, aware of thousands that condemn it. “Iapos;ve met people on this site who literally stand for bringing back stoning-to-death because the bible prescribes it... are they extremists? Does their existence or, more properly, do their beliefs not demonstrate the responsibility that religion has for making the World a worse place?” Iapos;ve seen atheists who believe that the only problem with Communism is that it didnapos;t kill enough believers. Iapos;ve seen atheists use Charles Darwin to promote and excuse eugenics, murder, rape, and racism. Iapos;ve seen atheists who claim that anyone who subscribes to religious belief should be thrown into psychological institutions and tortured until theyapos;re “cured.” Is the world improved by their existence or beliefs? In my previous argument, I addressed that the bloodiest democidal regimes of the 20th century were almost exclusively spearheaded by atheists, despite the fact that, from a global perspective, atheists are an incredibly small demographic. Is that not reason to be concerned? Furthermore, if a Christian promotes slavery because of Deuteronomy, I can show him Galatians 3:28, which proclaims that there is no slave and free, Jew and Gentile, male and female, because we are all equal under Christ. However, if an atheist promotes slavery because of naturalism and survival of the fittest (after all, Slave-Making Ants do precisely what their name implies, why shouldnapos;t we?), I have nothing to offer him but pseudo-philosophy and an ethics lecture which he would be well within his rights to dismiss as insufficient evidence. Is that enough reason to condemn non-belief as dangerous? “James Inhofe is potentially the most powerful man on Earth in terms of setting policy regarding man-made climate change, limiting carbon emissions, limiting agricultral chemical run-off, pollution, etc... and he says that thereapos;s no such thing as man-made climate change and he seems to think that Bronze Age texts (specifically the book of Genesis) prove that fact. Whatapos;s worse is that he uses Romans 1:25 to peddle the idea that any climate campaigners are essentially working for the devil by worshipping false gods (worshipping the creation not the creator).” Strange, that, seeing as the very book of Genesis names Man as the steward of Earth, and discusses his responsibility in its subsequent corruption after the Fall. The bible also discusses how creation declares the glory of God. What reason could we possibly have to want for its destruction? Someone who cannot be bothered to read anything more than what they personally find useful is a hypocrite, and someone who thinks that the bible has anything significant to say on a topic as isolated to modern science as climate change (or GMOs, for that matter) is someone I wonapos;t hesitate to accuse of using religion as a cover for their personal biases. However, once again, we cannot necessarily blame religion for its idiots. “The Catholic church [peddles] the idea that condoms are universally wicked; the result of this is absolutely, specifically and directly that innocent men women and children suffer horribly and die because of the unnecessary spread of AIDS in Africa [2]. I blame religion for this effect; are you with me?” This is actually nowhere near as cut-and-dried as people think it is. Abstinence, fewer sexual partners, and monogamy are doing more to halt the AIDS crisis than condoms [1] [2]. Strangely, all three of those sound suspiciously like Christian teachings. quot;in reality, murder rates are not obviously negatively correlated (quite the opposite) with religiosity.quot; Con has not addressed my rebuttals on this point. Finally, I actually would stand to disagree with Con that group selection accounts for morality and renders religion unnecessary in that regard. Group selection is a logical concept, but not a realistic one. After all, while a tribe that shares its food equally among its members will be stronger than a tribe that does not, tribal members that exploit the altruism of their fellows and hoard whatever food they can grab will be much stronger and better off than those they are exploiting, and will therefore be better candidates for natural selection. Even positing social consequence (i.e., they choose not to steal food for fear of a punishment from the tribe) falls flat because it requires there to already be a moral understanding in place (i.e., stealing food is wrong, and deserves to be punished). Morality of the kind that humans currently possess is not realistic through an evolutionary lens, because the “selfish gene” cannot (and has no reason to) act in the best interests of the group, only the individual. Even kin selection only explains altruism within oneapos;s genetic group. As far as this debate goes, hereapos;s what I acknowledge:    1. beliefs, more often than not, lead to actions.    2. if those beliefs are harmful, the actions will be harmful.    3. if religions preach things that are harmful, and people believe and act on them, itapos;s safe to say that religion does not improve the state of the world.    But I also believe this:   1. religion teaches many things that are good, just, merciful, kind, and selfless.   2. religion is not to blame for people who misuse it or misunderstand it.   3. atheism/secularism has just as much capacity to cause evil as religion.   In conclusion, this debate has not seen me at my best. I feel it is only right to admit defeat, as I agree entirely that I have not provided sufficient evidence that religion, as a whole, makes the world a better place. I do believe that Christianity, at least, is a force for good, and I believe I can (and have) made that point to one degree or another, but as far as the topic at hand, I acknowledge my lack of a strong case. I thank Con for an insightful discussion, and hope the voters will bestow their points on the deserving winner. [1] http://www.washingtonpost.com... [2] http://www.nationalreview.com...</t>

  <pair id="329" entailment="NONENTAILMENT" task="IE">
    <t>First of all, Iapos;d like to thank Pro for accepting the debate and tip my hat to a clinical first round.I do concede one aspect of religion that is almost unambiguously positive: it provides individuals with a support group.  This seemingly simple provision has lots of knock-on effects, and I would argue that one mechanism underpinning many of Proapos;s first statistics (insofar as they are accurate) is the sense of community that a church engenders; we are, after all is said and done, highly social animals.I consider this a challenge to secular communities around the World: we must find a way to reproduce that one powerful and important successful aspect of religion... the stability of a support network of mutual trust and love.  I see no reason why this effect cannot be achieved in a secular setting, thus robbing religion of a monopoly that it currently exploits.Right now, secular communities are in the large part failing this challenge; this situation provides the basis to make the claim that religion is making the World better... in one sense, it is... it is via our religions that we have (as a species) discovered the most successful bonding mechanisms for large groups.  There are dangers as well as benefits, though; the power that religion weilds is both a cohesive and a divisive force.  I will return to this idea in a later round.Pro begins on the edge of a very real (but small) effect: atheism correlates with higher suicide rates.  On the face of it, this is a no-brainer win for Pro.  I beseech the gentle reader consider why the correlation happens, though.  It is a discussion that has been thrashed out over the years; one key player in the understanding of the effect is the philosopher David Émile Durkheim, who has been widely acknowledged as one of the fathers of modern Sociology.  Whilst I do not think that everything he says is right, I would encourage any gentle reader interested in the subject from a scholarly perspective to begin with Durkheim.Unfortunately, the study that Pro cited is not particularly useful in studying the effect.  Problems include:1.  The study is looking at suicide attempts, not completed suicides.  It should not need stating but we have much more accurate statistics about actual suicides than about attempts.2.  The study has n=371; this is *far* too small a group to draw conclusions from.3.  It is unclear how effectively the study selected the 371 participants in an impartial way.But didnapos;t I already concede the point that atheism correlates with higher suicide rates?  Yes, yes, I did... but the very article to which Pro directs our attention [1] warns away from a simplistic interpretation of this fact by saying quot;compassionate tolerance for suicide and euthenasia are widely regarded as hallmarks of many secular societiesquot;.  It may also be noted that more men commit suicide than women, that suicide rates are higher in rural communities AND that suicide rates are higher in industrialized countries.The point that Iapos;m making here is that suicide (or euthanasia) might not be universally bad.  I, for one, present my thinking on this point in this way:1.  There exists such a reality as can be described by the words quot;a fate worse than deathquot;2.  I can see no moral justification for pressuring any sentient being who self-identifies quot;a fate worse than deathquot; to endure it. - (unless they have dependents, when the story may be more complex)The idea that suicide is universally unacceptable seems to me an artefact of religion (so strong was this pressure that attempting suicide was a criminal offence in my native England until 1961).  What moral reason does the atheist have for objecting to suicide? We donapos;t have to like it, but atheists are generally more accepting of the idea in principle.  Of course we would encourage counselling or medical routes before agreeing that this last resort is a good answer to a given situation.In short, I see no reason why we should accept that a very small decrease in suicides in some American religious communities equates to the World being a better place.  In extreme cases, it may even mean that because of religious pressure (itapos;s a sin to kill yourself), some individuals manfully endure a fate worse than death.  This seems to me to be a bad thing.  I hope that I have given the pensive reader pause for thought.So far Iapos;ve dedicated half of my space this round to Proapos;s first claim.  This seems excessive, perhaps, but I wanted to explore Proapos;s primary claim first.  In case Pro didnapos;t intend for the claims to be in priority order, I invite Pro to pick one or more quot;favouritequot; claims in order to reduce the sheer volume of discourse that would be necessary to tackle some of the issues.More briefly, then, Iapos;ll examine the rest of the claims that Pro makes; if Pro wishes to focus their claims then I will dedicate more effort (as I have with suicide).Proapos;s second claim was based on a paper called “Relationships among Spirituality, Religious Practices, Personality Factors, and Health for Five Different Faiths”, which I took the time to look up.  This paper [2] refers to a study done on 160 people.  I hope that our audience will not be swayed by such small studies, from which we can draw no more than loose conclusions about how such effects may be evident in broader populations.I suggest reference to the rough-guide table of requisite sample sizes provided by the Open University in my reference [3].  According to this table, a study of 371 people may be suitable to describe a population of about 10,000 people.  A study of 160 people may be suitable to describe a population of up to 500 people.  You would need more than 384 people in a study to justify describing a population of 1,000,000 and more again to describe the population of the UK, the US, Europe, Africa or, as the resolution requires, the World.  It is not good science to take a study of 160 people and generalise about the World. Sorry, Pro, but this just wonapos;t do.  Iapos;m also going to include a link [4] which may not be considered as authoritative as the OU, but explains the issues around sample size in a more accessible way.Proapos;s third link discusses a study of 179 people; sorry to get boring, but this wonapos;t do.Proapos;s fourth link at least looks more promissing, certainly in numbers.  In a study of 3,968 older adults in the Piedmont region of North Carolina... Iapos;m going to stop here because I havenapos;t limitless room to debate.  I will come back to this and the other links Pro offers in a later round if necessary.  For now, Iapos;d like the gentle reader to note that all of Proapos;s statistics relate to America and that the proposition before us relates to the World.Phil Zuckerman has completed a World-wide meta-study to answer some of the questions [5].  He is very clear about his methodology and sample sizes.  Iapos;m going to list some of his findings (all available from [5]).0.2 percent of prisoners in the USA are atheists(10% - 30% of the American population are atheist, depending on specific definition)If religion, prayer, or God-belief hindered criminal behavior, and secularity or atheism fostered lawlessness, we would expect to find the most religious nations having the lowest murder rates and the least religious nations having the highest. But we find just the opposite. Murder rates are actually lower in more secular nations and higher in more religious nations where belief in God is deep and widespread (Jensen 2006; Paul 2005; Fajnzylber et al. 2002; Fox and Levin 2000). And within America, the states with the highest murder rates tend to be highly religious, such as Louisiana and Alabama, but the states with the lowest murder rates tend to be among the least religious in the country, such as Vermont and Oregon (Ellison et al. 2003; Death Penalty Information Center, 2008). Furthermore, although there are some notable exceptions, rates of most violent crimes tend to be lower in the less religious states and higher in the most religious states (United States Census Bureau, 2006). Finally, of the top 50 safest cities in the world, nearly all are in relatively non-religious countries, and of the eight cities within the United States that make the safest-city list, nearly all are located in the least religious regions of the country (Mercer Survey, 2008).So Iapos;m going to wrap this up for now with a map of religiosity around the World [6].And Iapos;m going to note that if I have to concede a small dip in suicides (which may be a good thing), Pro will have to concede a far higher increase in murder rates... even if the effects were matched 1-1, is the World a better place if one less person commits suicide but one more person gets murdered?  Iapos;ll leave that for the gentle voter to decide!  I know this: Iapos;d rather commit suicide than be murdered.Kudos to Pro for keeping this on a dry statistical level so far, but your statistics could do with a bit more weight and a lot more geographical diversity![1] http://www.adherents.com...[2] http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...[3] http://www.open.edu...[4] https://www.checkmarket.com...[5] http://www.pitzer.edu...[6] http://upload.wikimedia.org...</t>

    <t>Iapos;ll start by thanking Pro for an intelligent and thought-provoking debate.  Iapos;m a little sad that itapos;ll all be over in the blink of another eye and would enjoy another debate with Pro on a related (or non-related) subject.  Kudos; keep it real!Iapos;ve got to squeeze a lot into this last round, so apologies for brevity in some areas that could easily suffer greater scrutiny.  Iapos;ve also left myself less than an hour to post this last round; and Iapos;m tired and a little groggy from the Bank Holiday in the UK that finished yesterday (itapos;s 6:30 AM here), so, again, apologies if this round lacks the focus and impartiality that it properly deserves.Whilst Pro nobly concedes that itapos;s almost impossible to argue against a belief being bad, as opposed to an action, I must admit that by my own professed standards of evidence, itapos;s not really fair for me to try to win too much ground on the basis of beliefs without evidence of how those beliefs translate to measurable actions; however, I do beg the gentle reader consider some beliefs: for a start, I beg the gentle voter consider whether a more sinister reality than merely belief must necessarily follow (even if we cannot easily measure the effect) from a significant group of people believing that gruesome death is an appropriate punishment for non-conformance to a set of metaphysical beliefs.  I precisely share Proapos;s sentiment when she says of the statistics about this belief quot;I must say I find them rather concerningquot;.Pro says that the Psalms are poems that should be given poetic license; Pro says that Deuteronomy contains prescriptions for other people; Pro suggests that much of the Old Testament represents an old covenant that is null and void. Pro suggests that the Jewish consensus is the rather contradictory position that stoning to death is moral but should not be practiced. Pro suggests that we should not tar religions with the same brush as we might use for extremists.  I ask: quot;and what, exactly, is an extremistquot;?  I feel that Pro, like most Christians I know, is a sensible, rational, kind and intelligent force for good in this World. Most religious people are moderate and sensible and kind and good.  I donapos;t (unlike some of them) attribute their goodness to their religion... in fact, I believe that most people I know are sensible, rational, kind and intelligent and a force for good in this World (and I believe that thereapos;s good reason why natural selection through group selection made us that way); religionapos;s effect is hard to measure but from my personal experience, religion never does what it claims (makes people kinder or more moral).The idea that Psalms can be undermined by the attribution of poetic licence (not treated literally) will offend a certain number of Christians; are they extremists?  The idea that Deuteronomy should be seen as applying to others will likewise offend a certain number of Christians; are they extremists? The idea that the Old Testament is somehow quot;null and voidquot; because of the quot;new covenantquot; is not biblically supportable (in fact, Jesus is quoted as saying that he comes not to change the [Mosaic] law) and will offend a significant number of Christians; are they extremists?I have met Christians on this site who are quite happy to cite the bible as sufficient justification for the idea that homosexual acts are a sin (whilst using sophistry to distance themselves from the Bibleapos;s pro-slavery stance); Iapos;ve also met Christians on this site who take the view that slavery may well be moral because the Bible seems to be for it... are they extremists?  I know this: families are literally torn apart because a son is gay; that sentence needs correction: families are literally torn apart because they are religious; homosexuality is not a choice, religion is.Iapos;d like to know what Pro thinks about Christians who consider the bible to be inerrant and the literal word of God: are they extremists? If a person believes the story of Adam and Eve literally, believes the story of Noahapos;s Ark, believes that Jonah was swallowed by a big fish, believes that atheists are fools that do no good, believes that itapos;s moral and appropriate to stone children to death for disobedience to their parents... are they extremists?  Iapos;ve met people on this site who literally stand for bringing back stoning-to-death because the bible prescribes it... are they extremists?  Does their existence or, more properly, do their beliefs not demonstrate the responsibility that religion has for making the World a worse place?Iapos;d like to focus the gentle readerapos;s attention to the fact of James Inhofe.  He is currently, for the second time, Chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Environment.  I have absolutely no idea what he believes (although he often waxes lyrical about it); what worries me, in the context of this debate, is that a man can win political points in America for coming out publically and saying such completely ****ing stupid things as he does [1].  I beg Pro and the gentle reader to really listen to what James Inhofe has to say.James Inhofe is potentially the most powerful man on Earth in terms of setting policy regarding man-made climate change, limiting carbon emissions, limiting agricultral chemical run-off, pollution, etc... and he says that thereapos;s no such thing as man-made climate change and he seems to think that Bronze Age texts (specifically the book of Genesis) prove that fact.  Whatapos;s worse is that he uses Romans 1:25 to peddle the idea that any climate campaigners are essentially working for the devil by worshipping false gods (worshipping the creation not the creator).The Catholic church peddle the idea that condoms are universally wicked; the result of this is absolutely, specifically and directly that innocent men women and children suffer horribly and die because of the unnecessary spread of AIDS in Africa [2].  I blame religion for this effect; are you with me?  I say that it is a far greater offence that the largest organised religion on Earth preaches things that directly cause the suffering and death of my innocent and powerless human brothers and sisters than it would be for a married African man to occassionally rubber-up and sleep with a prostitute on the way home from work (much as I, like the religious, question the morality of this action).Religious belief, I charge, causes one to have certain opinions on issues such as gentically modified crops (how could you believe in a creator of all life and not be profoundly worried by the idea of mankind having the hubris to tinker with that?).  I donapos;t say that GM is universally good... indeed, there are atheistic scientists who urge caution about some aspects of the GM debate; what I do claim, though, is that religion predisposes you to lean a certain way... and, like the Catholic church with sex, condoms and AIDS, this leaning literally causes the suffering and death of significant numbers of innocent men, women and children every year.  In this case, Golden Rice [3][4] could prevent suffering, blindness, illness and death by preventing Vitamin A deficiency.  And we are talking about the lives of tens of millions of human beings every year.It is a natural inclination to believe that a human being who thinks that there is a big sky-daddy watching their every move will behave more morally; it is all of our gut reactions (even atheists) to think that anybody who fears eternal suffering will limit their own bad actions... and yet, in reality, murder rates are not obviously negatively correlated (quite the opposite) with religiosity.  Furthermore, there is good evidence to support the idea that religious beliefs cause palpable damage in the World.  I urge the gentle voter to find against the motion; religion, contrary to our instinctive assumptions and religionapos;s own claims about itself, does not the World a better place make!If you donapos;t do it for me, do it for our grandchildrenapos;s environment that James Inhofe is happy to see damaged; do it for the millions of innocent men, women and children who die in Africa every year from AIDS or Vitamin A deficiency: vote Con!I have thoroughly enjoyed this debate and have come to have a lot of respect for Pro; however, I charge that Pro has not provided sufficient evidence of any positive effect of religion that could matter as much as the profound negative consequences that I hope I have demonstrated it has.  I beg the reader remember that we are debating a World-wide issue that includes not only your own personal religion but all religions.  And I remind the voter that I do understand that most religious people are decent human beings who make the World a better place; that was not the issue under scrutiny; the idea here is: would those people be as good without religion?  I charge that they would... how about we all (perhaps arrogantly) accept credit for our own decency and stop attributing our worth to our metaphysical beliefs?  Or, if youapos;re not happy accepting credit for your own decency, attribute it to the wonderous marvel of group selection; I know that I do![1] http://www.rightwingwatch.org...[2] http://en.wikipedia.org...[3] http://www.goldenrice.org...[4] http://blogs.scientificamerican.com...</t>

    <t>Thank you, Pro, for admitting the weakness in your Round 1 statistics.  They suffer from being small-scale and geographically centralised.When you say: quot;I would have liked to cite being in physical journals or books, which I am obviously unable to provide links to (and I hardly expect Con or the voters to rush out and buy them to determine their informationapos;s reliability)quot;, you do me an injustice.  I am rational and fair-minded enough to actually want to know if Iapos;m wrong.  Therefore I ask that you at least list the sources which you have which have obviously convinced you of the truth of the proposition.  I may well purchase access to an academic paper or buy a book (I may even prove to you that I have done so).  I donapos;t want to believe wrong things!When you say quot;most of the research on the topic of religionapos;s correlation with better health (which is, in itself, a fairly young area of study) comes from the United Statesquot; and quot;there is so far a paucity of resources as far as the world at large is concernedquot; then you are implicitly agreeing that the jury is still out on the question, so you can hardly claim it as a point to you in this debate.  Donapos;t believe things without sufficient evidence, please; if you do, please donapos;t expect the rest of us to share your opinions.quot;I can endeavour to find studies with more representative subject pools should Con request itquot; - please do so.It is true that we have to be careful how we interpret brute data.  I could have started by citing some very strong statistics that link religiosity with murder rates all over the World.  All over the World.  At any scale... religious regions have more murder, religious countries have more murder, religious continents have more murder.  Murder and religion are heavily correlated.  This does not, as Pro so rightly reminds us, imply causation.  Nobody should be saying that these statistics simply mean that quot;religion causes murderquot;; that would be a grave error in interpretation.  But whatapos;s the alternative to this fallacious reasoning?  What is the underlying story that causes both murder and religion?  Perhaps itapos;s poverty... perhaps itapos;s political instability... perhaps itapos;s violence.  Indeed, those three things are correlated with both murder and religion.  Itapos;s interesting to note, is it not, that religion thrives in hard times?  If one were being frightfully cynical, one might make a statement such as quot;religion finds it easier to get its claws into the young, the old, the weak, the poor, the sick, the dying and the disenfranchisedquot;.It upset me to read quot;Zuckermanapos;s broad-brushing of the issue smacks much more of bias than sciencequot;.  I did not attack the bias of Proapos;s sources, although well I might have done.  I withheld from such an attack without solid evidence.  I ask Pro to explain what evidence he has of Zuckermanapos;s bias.  I have studied the report in detail and find, if anything, an admirable lack of bias.quot;When considering these kinds of statistics on a global scale, there are too many factors involved. One cannot take the stance of quot;all things being equal.quot;quot;Well put, Pro, well put.  It is very tricky to draw the right conclusions when studying something so complex as causation of effects in human society.  We must always remember exactly what questions we are seeking to ask, and we must be open to some explanations that put our statistics in a different light.Quite so, quite so.Hereapos;s a confounding factor: religions often (from their high horses of claimed love for all) preach against atheists.  Atheism is a moral wickedness, in many religionsapos; eyes; indeed, false belief is really bad.  If we look at the Bronze Age writings that form the core of certain Abrahamic faiths, we find that the right thing to do to people who believe in the wrong God is to stone them to death.  Nice, that, isnapos;t it, for religions that claim to be peace-loving, tolerant, modern and enlightened?Let me remind the gentle audience of what the bible has to say about that:Psalm 14:1The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.”  -  They are corrupt, they do abominable deeds,  -  there is none who does good.Deuteronomy 13:6-9If your brother, your mother’s son, or your son or daughter, or the wife you cherish, or your friend who is as your own soul, entice you secretly, saying, ‘Let us go and serve other gods’ (whom neither you nor your fathers have known, of the gods of the peoples who are around you, near you or far from you, from one end of the earth to the other end),  you shall not yield to him or listen to him; and your eye shall not pity him, nor shall you spare or conceal him.  But you shall surely kill him; your hand shall be first against him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.(An enquiring reader might also read Deuteronomy 17:2-5)Bear in mind that there are people who believe that the bible is the literal Word of God and is inerrant and infallible.Either way, it remains true that some once-religious people who quot;come outquot; as atheists lose their friends, their families and their jobs (especially in America).  Now, would it not be fair to factor this kind of effect into any discussion on the effects of religion?  I mean, if people lived longer and happier as part of a Mafia group in a certain region because of the effects of that Mafia on non-members, should we conclude that the group makes the World a better place?  I should think not!Thus I suggest that the fairest thing we should be doing is comparing countries that are mostly atheistic to countries that are mostly theistic to get an impartial assessment without conflicting effects.  This has the added bonused of beating potentially biased surveys and including very large numbers of people in the mix... this produces accuracy.  I invite Pro to raise the debate to this level.  I note with joy that Proapos;s second link does exactly this: it makes the case that poverty causes religion.  Now, itapos;s interesting reading, and it asks us a new question: is it true that religion alleviates the depravations of extreme poverty?  I assume that Pro thinks that it does (I do not) but I invite Pro to address this more interesting question.Pro says quot;Zuckermanapos;s article mentions that the most religious states, such as Alabama and Louisiana, have the highest rates of murder. They also tend to have high rates of gun ownership and lax laws [5]quot; - again, I ask: please could we get to the beating heart of the issue by asking what the reason is for a correllation between gun ownership and religion; or lax laws and religion?  Whatapos;s really going on?I couldnapos;t find a nice description of the raw facts on the internet, so Iapos;ve composed my own, based on the most populous countries in the World (gt;100,000,000 people).  I include population, degree of religiosity and intentional homicide rate (per 100,000 people per year)China (1.4 billion) - 41% religious - murder rate 1India (1.3 billion) - 84% religious - murder rate 3.5US (0.32 billion) - 66% religious - murder rate 4.7Indonesia (0.26 billion) - 81% religious - murder rate 0.6Brazil (0.20 billion) - 92% religious - murder rate 25Pakistan (0.19 billion) - 98% religious - murder rate 7.7Nigeria (0.18 billion) - 98% religious - murder rate 20Bangladesh (0.16 billion) - 99% religious - murder rate 2.7Russia (0.15 billion) - 58% religious - murder rate 9.2Japan (0.13 billion) - 29% religious - murder rate 0.3Mexico (0.12 billion) - 56% religious - murder rate 21.5Philippines (0.10 billion) - 95% religious - murder rate 8.8As you can see, there is a positive correlation between religiosity and murder rate.  Now, I am not making the fallacy of jumping straight to quot;therefore religion causes murderquot; - what I am saying, though, is that if you want to be sure that quot;religion makes the World a better placequot;, youapos;ve got an awful lot of work to do explaining why it seems to be the other way around.In Nigeria, half the Muslim community agree with the death penalty for leaving Islam and there are regions with strict apostasy laws.In Pakistan, 64% of the population want the death penalty for converting from Islam [1].In Bangladesh, itapos;s a much more tolerant 36% of people who think that men, women and children should be killed for non-belief [1].If you add up the populations of Pakistan and Bangladesh, you get more than the population of the US.  Looking at these people, about 50% are convinced that it is the morally correct thing to do to kill people who lose their faith.  I donapos;t think that you can fairly ignore these facts when asking quot;does religion make the World a better place?quot;.[1] http://www.pewforum.org...p.s. I am going to use the next round to further the case that religion, in fact, makes the World a worse place.  I will use Round 5 for summing up and final rebuttals.  I just thought that Iapos;d give Pro a chance to focus a little more globally before I brought the big guns out :)</t>

    <t>Once again, my apologies for my prior forfeit. Thanks to Conapos;s generosity in giving me some extra time to respond, Iapos;ve been able to examine their argument a little more completely. Having done so, I find myself in the interesting position of having to defend the specific beliefs, as opposed to the practices, of Islam—a religion I do not personally subscribe to—and given some of Conapos;s sources, I admit that Iapos;m not sure Iapos;m able to. I was not aware of the statistics regarding the acceptance of stoning apostates in Islam, and I must say I find them rather concerning. I am not familiar enough with the Koran to determine whether this sort of devotion to Sharia law is justified in the text, or whether it counts as extremism, so I canapos;t comment one way or the other. If this concession is enough to lose me the debate, then fair enough; I truly canapos;t defend it.However, the Psalms are poems, meaning that vivid imagery and anecdotal descriptions should be expected, and as far as the verses from Deuteronomy cited by Con, they speak specifically of apostasy within the nation of Israel based on their covenant with God, not seeking out nonbelievers from other nations, which seems to be what a lot of people assume. This covenant is null and void in the Christian faith due to the sacrifice of Christ, and as far as Judaism is concerned, the general consensus is that while the death penalty may be moral in theory, it should not be put into practice (not to mention that the standards of evidence required to even convict a “guilty” person are so steep that itapos;s virtually impossible anyway) [1]. Additionally, if a Christian makes grand proclaimations about the bibleapos;s commands to love oneapos;s neighbor before marching off to hate their neighbors, Iapos;m not sure the blame for that lies with religion so much as human hypocrisy.Itapos;s definitely true that atheists have been mistreated by religious people on the basis of their nonbelief, but itapos;s very much incorrect to assume that those discovered to be religious arenapos;t similarly mocked, abused, and discriminated against by atheists (although less frequently, I imagine, given atheismapos;s comparatively small demographic). The rise of the movement dubbed “New Atheism” seems to operate on a platform that the religious deserve to be treated this way.Con asks quot;is it true that religion alleviates the depravations of extreme poverty? I assume that Pro thinks that it does (I do not) but I invite Pro to address this more interesting question.” Admittedly, Iapos;m not sure what Con means by this. The source I provided seems to make a good case for religion having a positive effect on those suffering poverty, and as Con has not explained what leads them to believe otherwise, I canapos;t be sure what point they intended me to address. The circumstances of extreme poverty? Its causes? Its effects? On a personal level, or a societal one? Con suggests that “Itapos;s interesting to note, is it not, that religion thrives in hard times? If one were being frightfully cynical, one might make a statement such as quot;religion finds it easier to get its claws into the young, the old, the weak, the poor, the sick, the dying and the disenfranchised.quot;” One may very well make such a statement, as it certainly bears to be considered. But one may also appeal to the words of Jesus Christ and note that “it is not the healthy that need a doctor, but the sick.” The disenfranchised have more reason to wonder if an ultimate justice will be served than those who are privileged. The old and the dying have more reason to wonder what comes after death than those who have decades left. The poor and the sick have more reason to seek miraculous help than those who arenapos;t suffering. Maybe religion finds the downtrodden because theyapos;re the ones actively looking for the answers it provides.In the same vein of frightful cynicism, however, one might suggest that atheism finds it easier to get its respective claws into those who refuse to bend the knee to any authority besides themselves—after all, if thereapos;s no God, what authority could be higher than oneapos;s own? This would certainly serve as an explanation as to why so many regimes marked by unspeakable violence and bloodshed at the hands of their governments in the last century or so have been spearheaded by avowed atheists (the usual suspects being Josef Stalin, Mao Tse-Tung, and Pol Pot, but letapos;s not forget Enver Hoxha, Fidel Castro, Mengistu, Mussolini, and Kim Il-Sung, among others). And while weapos;re asking questions, can people who reject religionapos;s gods, and nonetheless cling to the greater part of their moralities (a concept condemned by Nietzsche, and more recently, Michael Onfray) even claim their moral opinions as secular in the first place?As far as my claim about Zuckermanapos;s bias, I didnapos;t intend for it to be quite as harsh as it was apparently received. The way that he presented his statistics (at least to me) read as though Zuckerman was encouraging his readers to conclude that religion causes murder without any attempt at elaboration, which we have both agreed is not a fair assessment to make off-handedly with only the brute data.Conapos;s chart of religiosity and murder rates doesnapos;t seem to be accounting for Eastern Religions. If Iapos;m not mistaken, Shinto is the dominant belief system in Japan, and China has a large number of Taoists. As for the rest, I would hold that extreme poverty, illegal drug and gang activity, and low human development would account for the violence in most of the countries listed, and that religious belief could easily result from the effects of that violence, as stated above. That seems to me like it would be sufficient to explain the correlation.However, one question I think is central to this debate is at what point, exactly, could we count the benefits of religion as greater than its sins? Does the number of lives saved by religious altruism make up for the lives lost to religious extremism, for instance? And can religious extremism be considered true religion, since its actions (in every case Iapos;m aware of) go directly against the teachings it claims to espouse?Iapos;m afraid I ran out of time to locate better-rounded sources as requested, but I would suggest acquisition of the Handbook of Religion and Health from Oxford Press for a collection of meta-studies on the correlation of religiosity and quality of life.[1] http://en.wikipedia.org...

    <t>I freely admit that my sources for Round 1 are less than ideal. Given that I have the burden of proof in this scenario, I didnapos;t want to start things off by waxing philosophical. However, I found myself rather hampered in the sources I was able to provide due to much of the information I would have liked to cite being in physical journals or books, which I am obviously unable to provide links to (and I hardly expect Con or the voters to rush out and buy them to determine their informationapos;s reliability).Additionally, most of the research on the topic of religionapos;s correlation with better health (which is, in itself, a fairly young area of study) comes from the United States. I recognize that this debate is focused on a global scale, but as there is so far a paucity of resources as far as the world at large is concerned, I hoped that my opponent would at least consider American statistics to be worth considering. If so, I can endeavour to find studies with more representative subject pools should Con request it. If not, I am more than happy to move on to a different argument. I will leave that up to my opponent.I would like to begin by commenting on Conapos;s argument about the crime rates of religious countries. An interesting feature of the globeapos;s most religious countries is that many of them are in the developing world. Nations such as Mali, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Côte dapos;Ivoire, and Senegal, for instance, all marked in dark reds on Conapos;s map of religiosity, are included in the Nations Online Projectapos;s list of countries with the poorest human development [1] (and, while it may be tempting to conclude from this that religion causes poverty, itapos;s actually the other way around [2]).Even in more affluent places like Europe, the statistic doesnapos;t stand across the board. Eurostat reports: “Homicides are most prevalent in the Baltic States: Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. However, they are relatively rare in some southern EU countries (Malta, Italy, Spain) and Austria, Norway, Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden [3].” Interestingly, Estonia boasts the lowest number of religious adherents, whereas Malta has the highest [4]. Italy, Austria and Switzerland also have high levels of religiosity and low levels of atheism.I could also mention that Vietnam subscribes to state atheism and has massive numbers of non-believers—as well as significant issues with human rights.So letapos;s take it down a peg further and look at the United States. Zuckermanapos;s article mentions that the most religious states, such as Alabama and Louisiana, have the highest rates of murder. They also tend to have high rates of gun ownership and lax laws [5], which has been shown to correlate with higher rates of overall homicide in addition to gun deaths [6]. This could also serve as an explanation for why the United States has higher homicide rates than less religious countries such as Canada and Britain, where gun ownership is much more heavily restricted.In short, I would like to direct the readersapos; attention to what is known as the False Cause Fallacy, summed up nicely in the adage of “correlation does not imply causation.” Zuckermanapos;s broad-brushing of the issue smacks much more of bias than science. If Con beseeches the reader to consider additional reasons for the correlation of atheism and suicide, I believe I have the right to request the same considerations for religiosity and murder rates. When considering these kinds of statistics on a global scale, there are too many factors involved. One cannot take the stance of “all things being equal.”As far as the “fewer atheists in prison” argument, there are a couple of problems. According to [7] (which seems to be the only place to list the findings of Golumbaskiapos;s original study, cited in Zuckermanapos;s article), the religion of approximately 20% of inmates is unknown. Thatapos;s a significant margin, and it could conceivably be composed of anything from no atheists to all atheists. Perhaps these “unknowns” refused to answer (which would raise the question of why), but perhaps they are non-believers who simply chose to tick the “other” box as opposed to the “atheist” one. We donapos;t know. Additionally, these statistics do not account for conversions. We donapos;t know how many atheists there were going in vs. coming out. Prison ministries are surprisingly common, and itapos;s conceivable that there is a large percentage of people who come to faith in prison. As far as Conapos;s points on suicide (ignoring my sources for the time being), I consider it to be vastly different from euthanasia as far as the ethics and complexity of the issue. The idea that quot;suicide may not be universally badquot; is a point I would certainly stand to disagree with, but euthanasia is a different story. However, this is not the debate at hand, so I hope that we wonapos;t get too caught up in it. I would also note that Conapos;s comment that quot;the idea that suicide is universally unacceptable seems to me an artefact of religion,quot; while perhaps partially true, is somewhat nearsighted. It bears remembering that even if suicide is in the best interests of the subject in question, it is very rarely in the best interests of their loved ones. The idea of suicide being universally unacceptable seems like a fairly understandable response to the pain and grief suffered by the victimapos;s family and friends. After all, suicide victims do not have the luxury of explaining their reasoning. Even if religion had not played a part in the debate, itapos;s possible that we would have drawn the same conclusions either way.[1] http://www.nationsonline.org...[2] http://www.gallup.com...[3] http://ec.europa.eu...[4] http://www.gnxp.com...[5] http://www.huffingtonpost.com...[6] http://www.hsph.harvard.edu...[7] http://www.holysmoke.org...</t>

    <t>Thanks Pro for the opening arguments.Preface: - It should be noted that Pro’s Resolution is specific about eradicating poverty, not just reducing it. - Beside the utter lack of sources amp; support for his arguments, Pro has yet to argue for the eradication of poverty, as affirmed in his resolution. Case: I. Causes of Poverty: - Poverty, like ignorance amp; corruption, is a human condition entrenched in all societies past amp; present for it stems from causes that are inherent in the human psyche amp; rooted in the environment we live in. For brevity purposes we will limit the said causes to some of the more relevant ones: 1. Corruption: factor that makes it easy for the wealthy amp; authority to get richer at the expense of the poor, for there is a lock of higher authority to check the flow of wealth amp; thus the rules turn in favour of the fittest at the expense of the weakest [1]. Even Humanitarian Aid from rich countries (such as the US) to poor countries (such as sub-Saharan Africa) is damaged by corruption [2]. 2. Climate Change: a condition generally beyond human control: some areas have stable climate suitable for cultivating land, harvest amp; nurturing livestock, some others suffer from extreme unstable environments, heat, soil, rain. . . that disrupts the sustenance necessary for local populations, which in its turn creates amp; may even perpetuate Poverty.    3. Wars: a state of affairs that drains resources, human amp; economic, amp; destroys the socioeconomic structures that generate amp; distribute wealth, which also creates Poverty amp; prevent possible solution from being implemented to solve it. amp; wars are, too, a human condition existing as long as humans exist. 4. Natural Disasters: floods, volcanos, tsunamis, epidemics, earthquakes. . . all contribute in destroying both wealth amp; the structure that might preserve it. Cause that can not be eradicated, not by any human means. II. Reduction of Poverty vs Eradication of Poverty: - Pro’s contentions are almost all for the reduction of poverty, not for its eradication. Pro must provide a way through which the roots of Poverty can be eliminated for good, that if he wishes to support his resolution. - Furthermore, even in case a particular society was seemingly successful in eliminating poverty with itself, that would not imply its automatic success in eradicating it. That is because such achievements are contingent to a very specific circumstances of time amp; place amp; overall socioeconomic situation unlikely, even impossible, to form a perpetual state.  Rebuttals: - The only argument provided by Pro seemingly supporting his resolution, that is eradicating Poverty as opposed to suppressing it, is the following: “The argument that we have not ended poverty yet is not an argument that it canapos;t ever be done.”  - I certainly do not agree, for the above statement is inductively false. If, so far, we haven’t been able to end Poverty, then, inductively, that’s a good reason to believe that we never will. Believing there is a chance to end Poverty for good warrants, at the very least, as good a counter-argument as the above pure inductive argument is. An anology could be made with the following example: 1. So far the sun rises from the east. 2. The sun tomorrow will rise from the east. 3. The sun tomorrow will rise from the west. =gt; (1) is a fact ; (2) is inductively true, i.e certain. =gt; (3) is inductively false. Therefore, believing (3) to be true necessitate a serious argument strong enough to trump pure inductive reasoning! Hence my position.  Conclusion:  As I established throughout my round, eradicating Poverty isn’t simply rationally unjustified, for the statement “Poverty can be eradicated in the future” is inductively false, it is also amp; more importantly utterly hopeless, for Poverty is rooted in inunshakeable physical amp; mental realities, both internal amp; external, outside human influence.

    <t>Rebuttals:the fact we have reduced it puts us in a better position to be able to eradicate the remaining poverty. There is a relatively small number left to help (in some countries) making it more manageable- Pro’s proposition here is invalid, for:1. It’s a straw man fallacy! Arguing for reducing poverty does not help the case of eradicating it!2. His assumptions are grossly inaccurate: 1.1 billion people have inadequate access to water, 2.6 billion lack basic sanitation, 1.6 billion live without electricity, 1 in ever 2 children is in poverty. Poverty is very much rampant, unmanageable should be the more adequate word to describe it [1].Every invention could have easily been dismissed as not possible because it had not happened in the thousands of years before.- Pro is confusing argument from ignorance [2] with inductive reasoning [3].1. Every raven, so far, is black. Therefore, all ravens are black. =gt; This is an inductive argument.2. Every unicorn, so far, is cute. Therefore, all unicorns are cute. =gt; This is a argument from ignorance.=gt; In (1) we have a positive factual claim, as in supported by real evidence, whereas in (2) we have no real evidence.=gt; So far, poverty exists. Therefore, poverty always exists.Corruption is responsible for a relatively small share of the illicit money flow from developing countries.- Pro’s contention here is invalid, for:1. It’s a bare assertion, unsupported by his own source: “multinational companies steal more than 900bn from developing countries each year through tax evasion and other illicit practices.”2. Corruption, political or moral, is indeed one of major causes of poverty. Internally, it pushes Man into becoming ever greedy, thus not only does it prevent them from sharing wealth (i.e. preventing the reduction of Poverty) but it also initiates Poverty by compelling them to appropriate the wealth of others. Externally, it allows for even more lack of sharing amp; wrongful appropriation, thus a perpetual disparity of wealth: “In 1960, the 20% of the world’s people in the richest countries had 30 times the income of the poorest 20%, in 1997, 74 times as much”, “0.13% of the world’s population controlled 25% of the world’s financial assets in 2004” [1].- Also, corruption being in constant change is not reason enough to believe it can be eradicated! The world can counter the negative impacts of nature.- Countering the negative impacts does not imply eradicating them. Natural disasters have far reaching economic consequences [4]. Katrina for instance cost 108Bn amp; left hundreds of thousands unemployed [5], amp; millions homeless [6].Wars are becoming less frequent and deadly.- Again, bare assertion amp; non-supportive to Pro’s resolution, for:1. Less wars does not imply no more wars!2. Throughout history we had long periods of peace, amp; also long periods of war, successively. Such as WWI amp; WWII followed by the declaration of the UN [7].3. Currently, the World’s military expenditure amounts to 2.3% of its GDP (1776Bn) [8].=gt; Wars cause poverty, prevents its reduction amp; there is no reason to believe they can ever be eradicated.If […] the past is a good indicator of the future then those countries are looking good for the future.- Countries having had some success in a relatively short historical period (one century or less), does not imply they will have the same success perpetually! No civilisation has ever always stayed on top.Conclusion:- Pro’s entire case is a series of  bare assertions amp; straw man. He argues for reducing poverty amp; extrapolates to eradicating it! His sources are either non-existent or non-supportive. His arguments are contradicted by the facts. He has thus thoroughly failed to carry his BOP.

    <t>Hello,  I respectfully disagree that I focused on reducing it instead of eradication. I made the specific point that the fact we have reduced it puts us in a better position to be able to eradicate the remaining poverty. There is a relatively small number left to help (in some countries) making it more manageable hopefully and we have a successful foundation to build on. (Being the lessons learnt about what works).  I apologize for only referencing the organizations that I got my information from instead of specific links to each fact. (I have included them this time} I did mention the sources of information though in my last post and searching their sites will produce the info for those interested). I would also say the rebuttal to my statement that just because it has not been eradicated yet is not a strong one. Every invention and medical breakthrough in the 20th century could have easily been dismissed as not possible because it had not happened in the thousands of years before the 20th century.  Corruption is responsible for a relatively small share of the illicit money flow from developing countries. It also does not account for most of the poverty in rich countries. Unemployment, underemployment and low pay play much bigger roles there. There are also mechanisms to reduce corruption like Partnership in Transparency Fund {a charity}. Corruption itself does not mean the money that does make it can not work. Foreign aid still has plenty of success stories. The varying corruption rates across the globe and the changing list of most corrupt countries indicates that corruption is not some unchangeable part of nature but changes based on changeable factors  Blaming global warning and natural disasters for poverty is unfair. No doubt it makes things worse for farmers but there is a reason why Australia had the worse drought in 100 years and it did not result in mass starvation and death. It is not just about nature. The world can counter the negative impacts of nature. GMO crops are one way to partly protect against nature. Drought-resistant crops for example. The Commission for Africa although noting global warning is a problem for development pointed out many more man made issues like the need for storage facilities. Irrigation of land and the like.  Professor Steve Pinker notes that wars are becoming less frequent and deadly. We have also had times of relative peace like Pax Romana. Historians have also noted that war has not always occurred since the start of history. And countries like Switzerland and the pacifism movement demonstrates to me that war is not some inherent part of human nature that canapos;t ever be changed.  I argue that no strong case has been made that, quot;inunshakeable physical and mental realities..quot; mean that we canapos;t see the end to poverty. Con makes a good point that just because something is possible now does not mean that might be the case in the future. I would argue there are already countries that have had decades of relatively low poverty and if Conapos;s argument is that the past is a good indicator of the future {aka because we have not ended poverty in the past means...} then those countries are looking good for the future.  Full-time employment {that pays well} is one of the best ways to keep people out of poverty and as long as the government {or international community} can afford to pay for full-employment public works programs then there is a strong case that poverty could always stay gone. Mechanisms already exist to ensure long-term funding for programs. Sovereign wealth funds and compulsory superannuation funds as some examples.  Thanks for the debate.  http://www.aljazeera.com...

    <t>Thanks for accepting the debate. I will try my best.  We know that we can significantly reduce poverty because there are countries that have done it like Norway and Denmark. So I would argue that ending the relatively low amount of remaining poverty is not beyond possibility. {The money to do it is definitively there in the case of Norway. Norway has a sovereign wealth fund in the hundreds of billions that could be used to directly give every poor person in Norway enough money to have a socially acceptable amount of money or material possessions}.  We know that countries like America have been able to drive the poverty rate down by a significant margin. {Take during the early days of the war on poverty}. So again I would make the argument that a country could build on that by doing things already proved by independent evaluators to be effective. Critical time-intervention to tackle homelessness, expanding the nurse-family partnership and career academies as examples. {Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy has info on these programs}.  We know the sums of money to provide food is relatively affordable {for governments or business}. The cost of school meals for kids in developing countries for example is within the billions a year and not the hundreds of billions. {According to the World Food Programme}. We know there is enough food to go around according to hunger charities so it is not about there not being enough food in the world or resources of governments to pay for that food that sees people in the world going without an adequate amount of food. The argument that we have not ended poverty yet is not an argument that it canapos;t ever be done.  So for me this shows that we can/it is possible to end poverty and to ensure it does not come back.  I would argue there is enough evidence to show the world would be a better place without poverty. The impact that poverty has on the bottom-line. The Centre for American Progress estimates that childhood poverty alone in the US costs about 500 billion a year. Poverty is an underlying cause of human trafficking according to the United Nations. It is the underlying cause of a significant amount of bad health outcomes in America and around the world. {The latter according to the World Health Organization}. It is a cause of low educational achievement because poor kids are less likely to do well in school because of poverty. These are just some of the problems. So I would argue this shows why it would be a good thing to eradicate poverty.</t>

I donapos;t believe the statements that some people choose to be poor or do not take personal responsibility means we canapos;t help them out of poverty. We still have in place mechanisms to ensure they donapos;t live in poverty and have access to food, clothing and shelter.</t>

    <t>Contention 1: No Major/any CO2 Increase.      Many Global Warming advocates state that CO2 levels are skyrocketing, but that is incorrect. I give you the above graph measuring the past 600 million years of CO2 levels are we are actually at an all time low. Now the website I got this from no longer has this page up so I appologize. We can see from observance of this graph that we being at all time CO2 low levles that we are nowhere close to meeting the impact that my opponent brings up. We have been over 5,000 ppm of CO2 in our atmosphere and are now currently around apprx. 350 ppm CO2 levels.  The above graph shows that comparisions of C13 (Carbon isotope) and this shows that there is little to no trend pertrade in many of these as the average is zero while the trend for all of these are zero. (1) This is important as the Carbon isotope is important in measuring this so called quot;Global Warming.quot;  This chart above shows the CO2 and Earthapos;s temperatures for the past 600 million years. My opponentapos;s claims are incorect as we have had aburd levels of CO2 and temperature on Earth and may I ask how did we survive that? (2) Now I will move on to how Earth is actually cooling and how itapos;s temperature is cooler than it has been. Contention 2: Earth is cooling.  If we observe the above graph we can see that Earth has been a whole lot hotter than where we currently are to the point where the Earthapos;s average temperature has been 7.5 degrees Celcuis hotter than it currently it is. You can also see that in the span of the past 10,000 years the temperature has leveld off, but you may ask yourself where does that place us in the lights of modern day?  I am going to site Dr. Done Easterbrook, who is a climate scientist. Back in 2000 he predicted that Earth was entering a cooling phase. He predicts that for the next 20 years Earth will cool by 3/10 degree each year and that we are going to enter another little Ice Age like we did from 1650 and 1790. (3) The funny thing is that many of my opponentapos;s charts are actually from the incorrect IPPC. How about the quot;Hockey Stickquot; graph that many Global Warming supporters , including my opponent, argue about? Well if we observe the fallowing chart taken from Northern Scandenavia we can see that the Global trend over the past 1,000 years that the Global Cooling trend slope is that of -0.31 Degrees Celcuis, give or take 0.03 degrees (for the error room). Professor Dr. Jan Esper has found that the Earthapos;s temperature of Earth actually decreases 0.3 per millenia due to the Earth moving away from the sun. (4)   Here is another graph from 1920 to 2005 and we can see that the graph has a negative temperature slope, thus meaning that the Earth is under a period of cooling. (5)  You can see in terms of more Warming in the evidence in which Scientists use Ice Cores Earth has actually been Cooling the past Mellenium.  Finailly, lets bring up just how much these accused compounds exactly warm the Earthapos;s atmosphere. CO2 for example has the global warming potential of 1. Here are the other numbers. Carbon Dioxide -- 1Methane -- 21Nitrous Oxide -- 298-310CFCapos;s -- VariousWater Vapor -- 0.25 Now I just want you to keep this in mind for this next part here. We may observe that humans release approximately 35 gigatons of CO2 a year. [14] This is only 4.3% of the total amount of all Global Warming Gasses, however it is incrediably small when it comes to comparing the rest of the Global Warming gasses. If we observe the chart bellow we can see that Water Vapor is a large Contributor to Global Warming at 95% and CO2 comes in second. But hereapos;s the kicker. If we look at the Human contributed part that Iapos;m about to post in the graph bellow we can see that itapos;s very miniscule of 0.117% of all total Warming gasses. Now letapos;s do some quick math here. CO2apos;s increase was from what my opponent is claiming is from 295 ppm to 400ppm, a total of only 105 ppm. 1 Gigaton of CO2 is the equilivent of 2.13 ppm. [15] This means that increase of 105 ppm means a total of 49.29 gigatons. Since 1 gigaton of CO2 is the equivilance of .004% of the Greenhouse effect that means that 49.29 gigatons means an aditional .21% increase to Global Warming. This would account for a grand total of a 0.15 F increase in global temperature. This is a very measly amount and we can see that with my opponentapos;s claims a simple 0.15 F increase isnapos;t enough to melt glacers and have the effeccts that he is speaking of and it proves that this is NAUTRAL not man-made to fulfil his effects if they were real. Now remind yourself that this debate is about humans creating a LARGE amount of Global Warming, not a miniscule amount. You can see that in terms of Gasses contribution to the Green House Effect the major contributer is Water Vapor and itapos;s at 95% to CO2apos;s 3.6% and this is the overall contribution including man made and natural. When we look to the chart on the left we can see that Man-Made CO2 does have a higher contribution to the atmosphere than Water Vapor, but thatapos;s because we do not create much water vapor as humans. Even with this evidence we can see that CO2 does not have any effect what-so-ever compared to Water Vapor. (6) Where might those CFCs be on this graph you may ask. Why itapos;s under the Misc. gases section. Contention 3: Artic Ice. Al Gore stated that the Artic Ice would be completely melted by 2014, but he is incorrect then and now.  Jan. 6, 2012: The Coast Guard Cutter Healy breaks ice around the Russian-flagged tanker Renda 250 miles south of Nome. The Healy is the Coast Guard’s only currently operating polar icebreaker. The vessels are transiting through ice up to five-feet thick in this area. The 370-foot tanker Renda will have to go through more than 300 miles of sea ice to get to Nome, a city of about 3,500 people on the western Alaska coastline that did not get its last pre-winter fuel delivery because of a massive storm. (7) Letapos;s go back to 2007-2008 and see if his claim was justified in the Artic Ice activity.  Hmmm... It seems that he is incorrect, but letapos;s look further into the near past. How about 2012-2013? (8) We all remember the Climate Scientists that got stuck in Arctic Ice Earlier last year correct? Then a Russian Ice Breaker tried to free them, but got stuck. Can you guess what they were studying? They had predicted that all the Arctic Ice had melted due to Global Warming and that Earth would get flooded massively. Boy were they wrong. (9)  (10)  Dr. Koonin, former head of the Department of Energy under President Obama, has stated that the Global Warming scare is not suttle. This is because that he has found 3 things wrong and highly incorrect about the scare. 1. Shrinking of Artic Sea ice doesnapos;t acount for the gaining of the Antartic ice. 2. The warming of Earthapos;s temps today is the same as it was 30 years ago. 3. The sea levels rose at the same height and rate in the 20th cenury. (11) Contention 4: Sea Levels Here is another corralation that must happen. If the Ice Caps are completely melted as many GW advocates claim then the sea level would have risen completely drowning tons of land.  The graph above is raw satellite image data of the sea level rise over an 8 year period showing that there is little to no change in the Sea Levels rising. (12) The sea level rises, on average, about 3 inches per century and it has been found to not even been rising at all.  This graph is the sea levels off the cost of French Guyana which is one of the areas which is predicted to be flooded due to Global Warming, but as you can see by the graph (which goes to 2008) the sea level is currently on a downward trend. (13) The source is the PDF within the link.Contention 5: The WeatherMany Global Warming Advocates claim that Hurricanes are increasing due to Global Warming, but this claim is indeed false! The hurricanes since the year 1900 to 2008 have actually been decreasing. The slope of this downward slope is .0016. Though it is small the hurricanes are still in a downward trend.As a matter of fact not only are Hurricanes on a downward trend, but they are at an all time low as in the year 2010, there was only 68 Hurricanes Globally, which is an all time low in the past 40 years. How about Tornados you may ask?In the graph above you can see that tornados are at an all time low in the past 60 years! (14) But what about Hurricanes?Here is a graph showing the number of days between hurricanes and this shows that the number of days between hurricanes is greatest at 76 days between hurricanes.The slope of this line is zero showing no trend of a massive storm increase.

    <t>I would like to thank lannan13 for posting his arguments.No Major CO2 IncreaseThis is true. CO2 levels have been higher. But what were the climactic conditions during those periods? quot;The last time carbon dioxide levels were apparently as high as they are today - and were sustained at those levels - global temperatures were 5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit higher than they are today, the sea level was approximately 75 to 120 feet higher than today, there was no permanent sea ice cap in the Arctic and very little ice on Antarctica and Greenland.quot; Clearly, the levels that CO2 is reaching are unsustainable.[1]The reason the CO2 rise is considered high is because the CO2 level is the highest in around 50 million years. And it only took 150 years to get that way. So, while the CO2 level is not as high as it has been, the climate was much warmer then, and the CO2 rise is large in the large scale.CO2/Temperature CorrelationCO2 does not correlate exactly with temperature. However, if we consider CO2 and the sun, the correlation is almost perfect. The sun has not caused the most recent spurt of global warming, so it must be concluded that the rising CO2 levels are causing global warming.[2][3]The graph below shows the two forcings plotted against temperature:Further, my opponentapos;s correlation graph is inaccurate. It forgets the huge uncertainty early on.This graph shows the uncertainty:With this uncertainty, Robert Berner (the author of the study and graph), said himself, quot;Eexact values of CO2... should not be taken literally.quot; That correlation graph should not be taken seriously. The better one is the first graph above, that shows that CO2 has a big effect on the climate. Berner also said in the same study, quot;...over the long term there is indeed a correlation between CO2 and paleotemperature...quot;[4][5]The Earthapos;s Current Climactic TrendMy opponentapos;s studies are based on faulty data sets and misunderstandings about how the climate works. Different data sets show the Earth is warming, and the Earthapos;s climactic indicators show that the Earth is still warming.For one thing, my opponentapos;s temperature graphs are based off of RSS data. UAH and HADCRUT4 data both show that the Earth has been continuing to warm throughout the last 15 years.[6][7] For another, it was found that the heat content of the Earth is increasing. quot;This new research combines measurements of oceanheat, land and atmosphere warming and ice melting to find that our climate system continued to accumulate heat through to 2008... Since 1970, the Earthapos;s heat content has been rising at a rate of 6 x 10^21 Joules per year.quot; If you look back to my first round, youapos;ll see my point that excess CO2 traps heat, and this is exactly what weapos;re seeing[8][9]:Further, if we focus on surface and lower troposphere temperatures (just where weapos;d expect there to be warming), we see that the warming trend continues. quot;Foster and Rahmstorf (2011) used multiple linear regression to filter out the effects of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and solar and volcanic activity (Figure 2), and found that the underlying global surface and lower atmospherewarming trends have remained very steady in recent years.quot;[8][10]:The hockey stick continues to stick because thereapos;s no evidence that there were any periods for at least the last 2500 years that indicate that the climate was warmer then than it is now. The hockey stick was been replicated numerous times. This graph still appears to be the real story when it comes to the recent climate[11]:Interestingly, my opponentapos;s quot;Greenland GISP2 Ice Core - Temperature last 10,000 yearsquot; graph cuts off at 1850.[12]Water VaporMy opponent is correct that water vapor is the most important greenhouse gas. However, water vapor only acts as an amplifier of other warming. Water vapor levels canapos;t be raised. However, since CO2 levels can, the warming that follows is amplified by water vapor in the atmosphere. In other words, itapos;s a positive feedback (see my first argument), not a cause of warming in and of itself.[13]Arctic Ice LevelsThe claim that the arctic sea ice would be completely gone was an apocalyptic one that did not turn out to be true. However, it is still known that the levels of sea ice are decreasing. See the below graph:quot;The blue line represents the trend calculated from January 1 1979 to the most recent date indicated on the figure. Monthly averaged ice volume for September 2014 was 6,970 km. This value is 40% lower than the mean over this period, 59% lower than the maximum in 1979, and 0.7 standard deviations above the 1979-2013 trend.quot; The arctic sea ice levels are decreasing.[14]As for the Antarctic sea ice claim, while the sea ice is gaining in extent, it is decreasing in mass. This is the result of a complex set of scenarios.[15]This graph shows the loss in Antarctic ice mass:[16]The claim that the temperature are warming at the same rate doesnapos;t change the fact that increasing CO2 levels are behind the warming. As for the claim that arctic sea ice levels are rising at the same level, this is blatantly false, as the graph below shows:[17]Sea LevelsIt is true that the sea ice melting portends rising sea levels. However, the sea level is actually increasing. Looking at the sea level for an eight year period hardly shows a long-term trend, especially when thereapos;s variation in the climate. The sea level rise in French Guiana would not have inundated the country. Further, thereapos;s also variation in the sea level rise in different places.When the global data is analyzed, a clear trend of sea level rise is seen. quot;To construct a global historical record of sea levels, tide gauge records are taken from locations away from plate boundaries and subject to little isostatic rebound. This has been done in A 20th century acceleration in global sea-level rise (Church 2006) which reconstructs global sea level rise from tide gauges across the globe.quot;[18][19]:What can be seen is that the sea levels are rising, and that the increase is accelerating. Relying on isolated events and short-term trends does not answer the question of whether sea levels are rising as a whole globally.The WeatherThe correlation between global warming and weather is much more complex than my opponent gives the anthropogenic global warming theory credit for. For one thing, storms rely on many more variables than just temperature, especially tornadoes. quot;Then there are problems unique to tornadoes. Beyond knowing that they require a certain type of wind shear, meteorologists just don’t know much about why some thunderstorms generate tornadoes and others don’t.quot; If we donapos;t understand why certain thunderstorms create tornadoes, then we are in no place to analyze the correlation between tornadoes and one variable. We simply just donapos;t know enough yet here.[20]Hurricanes can be better analyzed, because they are more dependent on ocean temperatures than tornadoes are on land temperatures. Higher temperatures wonapos;t necessarily lead to more hurricanes, but they will lead to stronger hurricanes. quot;The Power Dissipation Index is found to increase since the mid-1970s, due to both longer and more intense storms. Hurricane intensity is also highly correlated with sea surface temperature. This suggests that future warming will lead to an increase in the destructive potential of tropical hurricanes.quot;[21][22]The below graph shows this:The correlation is clear here. Further, it was found that while the number of lower-intensity hurricanes has stayed about the same, the number of higher-intensity hurricanes has increased for this very reason. The greater number of hurricanes seen would be small, considering most hurricanes are lower-intensity.[23]SourcesSources in comments.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank lannan13 for accepting this debate.Human-Emitted Greenhouse GasesIt is known that CO2 levels are increasing. quot;In pre-industrial times over the last 10,000 years, CO2 was relatively stable at around 275 to 285 parts per million. Over the last 250 years, atmospheric CO2 levels have increased by about 100 parts per million.quot; CO2 levels are increasing at a level not seen in at least 500,000 years, if not longer.[1]Here is a graph showing CO2 concentrations over the last 10000 years:[2][3]This excess CO2 traps heat. Satellites measure less heat escaping out to space, at the particular wavelengths that CO2 absorbs heat, thus finding quot;...direct experimental evidence for a significant increase in the Earthapos;s greenhouse effect.quot; In other words, the Earth is retaining more of the heat that it receives from the sun that it received from before. This excess heat manifests itself through global temperature increases.[4]quot;If less heat is escaping to space, where is it going? Back to the Earthapos;s surface. Surface measurements confirm this, observing more downward infrared radiation. A closer look at the downward radiation finds moreheat returning at CO2 wavelengths, leadin to the conclusion that apos;...this experimental data should effectively end the argument by skeptics that no experimental evidence exists for the connection between greenhouse gas increases in the atmosphere and global warming.apos;quot;[5][6]CO2 correlates with temperature. Consider the Cenozoic era (the last 65 million years). Overall, solar activity increased 0.4% over this period. quot;Because Earth absorbs about 240 W/m^2 of solar energy, that brightness increase is a forcing of about 1 W/m^2. This small linear increase of forcing, by itself, would have caused a modest global warming through the Cenozoic Era.quot; The CO2 levels caused a much higher forcing. In contrast, atmospheric CO2 during the Cenozoic changed from at least 1000 ppm in the early Cenozoic to as small as 170 ppm during recent ice ages. The resulting climate forcing, as can be computed accurately for this CO2 range using formulae in Table 1 of Hansen et al. (2000), exceeds 10 W/m^2. It is clear that CO2 was the dominant climate forcing in the Cenozoic.quot;[7]In fact, the temperature changes correspond to the CO2 changes. quot;...there is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr.quot;[8]This graph shows the CO2-temperature correlation over the last 700,000 years:Indeed, it would be rather coincidental if the recent rise in global warming happened to start just around the time that humans started to emit large quantities of greenhouse gases. However, there is direct evidence as well, in addition to the already established correlation between temperature and CO2.One piece of evidence is a comparison of warming in the troposphere and stratosphere. Because the CO2 is in the upper troposphere, the troposphere temperature would increase, while the stratospheric temperature would decrease, because there would be less heat reaching the stratosphere. quot;Computer model estimates of the ‘human influence’ fingerprint are broadly similar to the observed pattern. In sharp contrast, model simulations of internal and total natural variability cannot produce the same sustained, large-scale warming of the troposphere and cooling of the stratosphere.quot;[9][10]This graph shows this:[5]Another piece of evidence is the frequency of cold days and nights. Because the sun only shines in the day time, is the sun was causing global warming, the days would warm faster than the nights, while if greenhouse gases were causing global warming, this wouldnapos;t be observed. It is the latterapos;s prediction that is observed. quot;What we observe is a decrease in cold nights greater than the decrease in cold days, and an increase in warm nights greater than the increase in warm days.quot;[5][11]This can be shown in the below graph:[5]Overall, the evidence shows that human-emitted greenhouse gases are the cause of global warming. CO2, in addition to other gases like methane and nitrous oxide are being emitted by humans in very large amounts, and this is manifesting itself in an increase in the average global temperature.Climate Sensitivity and FeedbacksClimate sensitivity is the amount the temperature would rise if the CO2 concentration were doubled. Obviously, if thereapos;s a large climate sensitivity, then increases in CO2 have large effect. It is known that the climate sensitivity is around 1 degree C. However, this can be amplified through feedbacks. Positive ones amplify the sensitivity, while negative ones diminish the sensitivity. The evidence overwhelmingly comes down on the former, that positive feedbacks are happening. Increases in CO2 cause temperature increases, which are amplified by water vapor and the effect on clouds.quot;Since the radiative effects associated with the buildup of water vapor to near-saturation levels and the subsequent condensation into clouds are far stronger than the equilibrium level of radiative forcing by the non-condensing GHGs, this results in large local fluctuations in temperature about the global equilibrium value.quot;[12]This can be shown in the below graph:Further, increases in CO2 affect the carbon cycle in this way:Global warming can result in the death of vegetation (due to droughts) and the warming of the ocean. Both of these further reduce the maximum absorption of the Earths carbon cycle, thus resulting in even more CO2 being released into the atmosphere. And with this, CO2 increases even more. In other words, CO2-caused temperature increases are amplified by positive feedbacks and the mechanics of the carbon cycle.So, the positive feedback amplifies the climate sensitivity. How much it is amplified can be determined through study. Using a Bayesian statistical approach, which is “the dominant [method] in the literature”, these findings support the notion of climate sensitivity as maximum 4 degrees C, a mean of 3 degrees C, and likely not lower than 3 degrees.[13]The graph below gives a statistical analysis:[14]The mean is around 3 degrees C.  The CO2 that humans emit thus has an effect of 3 degrees C per doubling of CO2. This can be shown by the fact that CO2 concentrations have increased from around 275 ppm to around 400 ppm. This is an increase of around 40%. This should manifest itself with a temperature increase of a little less than 1.5 degrees C. Indeed, temperatures have increased around this amount over the last 150 years. The anthropogenic-forcing climate models thus match observations.[15]In other words, in addition to the direct evidence of how the Earth is warming, the climate models based on a greenhouse gas cause to global warming explain almost perfectly the recent global warming. This is a lot of evidence for a human case to the recent global warming.ConclusionGreenhouse gases cause global warming because of their heat trapping abilities. Humans have been emitting vast amounts of greenhouse gases over the last 150 years, and this shows itself on the CO2 measurements. The atmospheric warming pattern and greater heating at night are evidence that the recent global warming is caused by those human emitted greenhouse gases. These increases are amplified through the water vapor and cloud positive feedbacks and the positive feedback that arises through the climate cycle. The climate sensitivity ends up being around 3 degrees C. Finally, the CO2-temperature record shows that the two correlate with remarkable correlation.SourcesSources in comments.</t>

    <t>There are some minor issues in conduct with my opponentapos;s constructive case, but Iapos;m not going to dwell on them. Primarily, this argument remains unaltered from when my opponent last debated this issue, which means he has left in irrelevant rebuttals, albeit to the wrong opponent.R1: No Major/any CO2 Increase.In the previous round, I preemptively refuted this first claim that historically higher carbon dioxide are relevant. In fact, as you will see, they are, if anything, evidence in favour of carbon dioxideapos;s effect on temperature, which Con later attempts to refute.quot;Many skeptics claim that historically, carbon dioxide levels have been much lower, particularly around 500-600 million years ago[1]. But the carbon dioxide level is not the only factor that affect global temperature[2]. Additionally, this position fails to account for the differences in solar activity, that was drastically different from current levels. This position also fails to explain why a comprehensive analysis of carbon dioxide levels over the last 540 millions years concluded that quot;Periods of low CO2 coincide with periods of geographically widespread ice.quot; This is clearly visible in this graph, where the shaded periods are periods of widespread ice.quot;[3]I shall also strengthen this argument and adapt it to Conapos;s specific contention.Firstly Con cites data, which no longer exists. This is bad practice. He should seek alternative data that supports his contention that, even if one assumes the data is reliable, I have unequivocally refuted.[1] http://www.lavoisier.com.au...[2] http://www.ipcc.ch...[3] http://droyer.web.wesleyan.edu...(GCA).pdfR2: [sic] Earth is cooling.This is patently not true and in most instances of my opponents argument, a bare assertion. In the others, he has cherry picked unsupported evidence. Of course the Earth has been hotter historically (due to solar activity), but this is irrelevant. In this debate we are referring to Global Warming, which is the consistent rise in temperature since the 20th century up till this point, which is clearly occurring. This figure shows the change in the earthapos;s total heat content since 1960[1]. This more advanced graph is the average of 5 different data sets, adjusted for the short-term effects of the El Nino Southern Oscillation, solar variability, and volcanic aerosols[2].Con then proceeds to [sic]site Don Easterbrook, who claims his model predicted the temperature more accurately than the IPCC. This is an outright falsehood. In fact, Easterbrook had to distort the IPCC projection figures to make his graph compelling. Here is the actual data[3]:We see that the IPCCapos;s projections were much more accurate. Shall we zoom in a bit more?Con then cites his first actual study, despite it being relatively insignificant, as it is a single study and has a largely negligent effect on the hockey stick graph. Iapos;m now going to provide some consistent and substantiated data regarding the hockey stick graph.The hockey stick is describes a sharp increase in temperature visible within a reconstruction of temperatures in the last 1000 years. The original paper describing this trend appeared in 1998,but since then there has been a number of notable proxy studies that have confirmed its findings[4][5][6]. In 2007 an independent study reconstructed largely similar results, and evaluated the statistical techniques employed to create it[7]: Conapos;s own graph was constructed from unknown data sets, presumably by NewsBusters, a questionable source (given their clear bias in documenting the issue). His next graph is also cited the same source, despite that graph not existing anywhere on the source page. I have no obligation to rebut something that has been pulled from thin air and not substantiated with fact, especially in supposedly scientific debates like this one.In his next argument, pertaining to water vapour, Con shows elementary misunderstanding of climate sensitivity and feedback. His argument can be summed up in the following format:P1: Water vapor makes up 95% of greenhouse gases and CO2 only . (Bare assertion)P2: The climate sensitivity of water vapour is around 0.25%. The climate sensitivity of CO2 is around 1%. (Disputable and unsourced, my Constructive Case hinted at a slightly higher figure between 2 and 4.5 degrees)P3: Global warming is occurring. (A sudden change of heart)C1: Water vapour is responsible for global warming,Before I begin tearing this nonsense apart Iapos;d like to urge voters to hold Con accountable for changing advocacy half way through his case (in the same contention!). He first contends that there is no warming, and then holds that there is warming, only that water vapour is responsible. We arenapos;t going to have quality discourse if Con does not hold a stable position.Con fails to understand that weak warming caused by more carbon dioxide will lead to more water vapor in the atmosphere, which will then amplify the weak warming through water vapor’s role as the atmosphere’s primary greenhouse gas. Water vapour is responsible for much of the greenhouse effect, but only because warmer air masses, on average, contain more water vapor. In short, water vapour acts a feedback, not a forcing[10]. Much of his further case was also preemptively rebutted in my initial constructive case: quot;Despite man made carbon dioxide emissions being comparatively smaller than natural emissions, the real driving force of climate change is the net quantity of carbon dioxide released, since most natural carbon emissions are absorbed[8]. Because of this, atmospheric carbon dioxide is at the highest levels in approximately 15 to 20 million years[9].quot;[1] http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com...[2] http://iopscience.iop.org...[3] http://www.skepticalscience.com...[4] http://www.meteo.psu.edu...[5] http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov...[6] http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov...[7] http://www.cgd.ucar.edu...[8] http://www.ipcc.ch...[9] http://www.sciencemag.org...[10] http://www.realclimate.org...R3:A single, self-described proponent of climate change being wrong, on a single instance, has no relevance to the ultimate scientific validity of climate change. This is hardly worth rebutting. Can we move discussion to the science, rather than people, and badly reported news stories?R4:Con argues that sea level rise has not occurred and cites Mörner, whose work has consistently been discredited by the organisations that he claims to represent:quot;Mörner claims that the quot;true expertsquot; think this data is wrong (emphasis added):  quot;The world’s true experts on sea level are to be found at the INQUA (International Union for Quaternary Research) commission on Sea Level Changes and Coastal Evolution (of which I am a former president), not at the IPCC. Our research is what the climate lobby might call an ‘inconvenient truth’: it shows that sea levels have been oscillating close to the present level for the last three centuries. This is not due to melting glaciers: sea levels are affected by a great many factors, such as the speed at which the earth rotates. They rose in the order of 10 to 11cm between 1850 and 1940, stopped rising or maybe even fell a little until 1970, and have remained roughly flat ever since.quot;  This is quite different from the INQUA official position on climate change, which opens by saying (emphasis added):  Climate change is realThere is now strong evidence that significant global warming is occurring. The evidence comes from direct measurements of rising surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures and, indirectly, from increases in average global sea levels, retreating glaciers, and changes in many physical and biological systems. It is very likely that most of the observed increase in global temperatures since the mid-twentieth century is due to human-induced increases in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere (IPCC 2007).quot; [1]  Unfortunately ounces up and down slightly from year to year so itapos;s possible to cherry-pick data falsely suggesting the overall trend is flat, falling or linear. Credible sources will all display sea level averages over the long term. Here is a study done by the University of Colorado [2]: It shows a clear trend in sea level movement since 1995. Another study, analysing global mean sea level from 1870 through 2006 determined another clear trend[3]:[1] http://www.skepticalscience.com...[2] http://sealevel.colorado.edu...[3] http://academics.eckerd.edu...R5: Con has not provided a single relevant source, which, quite frankly, in an entirely statistical and scientific argument, is unacceptable. I cannot rebut imaginary data. Next round, please provide valid sources and explain their relevance, and I will take delight in rebutting them,ConclusionMuch of Conapos;s argument has been founded on bare assertions and comprehensive misinterpretations of climate science. I have rebutted all his sourced claims, and hopefully cleared up much of his misunderstanding in regard to climate feedback.Onto the next round. Good luck, Con.</t>

    <t>Contention 1: No Major/any CO2 Increase.      Many Global Warming advocates state that CO2 levels are skyrocketing, but that is incorrect. I give you the above graph measuring the past 600 million years of CO2 levels are we are actually at an all time low. Now the website I got this from no longer has this page up so I appologize. We can see from observance of this graph that we being at all time CO2 low levles that we are nowhere close to meeting the impact that my opponent brings up. We have been over 5,000 ppm of CO2 in our atmosphere and are now currently around apprx. 350 ppm CO2 levels.  The above graph shows that comparisions of C13 (Carbon isotope) and this shows that there is little to no trend pertrade in many of these as the average is zero while the trend for all of these are zero. (1) This is important as the Carbon isotope is important in measuring this so called quot;Global Warming.quot;  This chart above shows the CO2 and Earthapos;s temperatures for the past 600 million years. My opponentapos;s claims are incorect as we have had aburd levels of CO2 and temperature on Earth and may I ask how did we survive that? (2) Now I will move on to how Earth is actually cooling and how itapos;s temperature is cooler than it has been. Contention 2: Earth is cooling.  If we observe the above graph we can see that Earth has been a whole lot hotter than where we currently are to the point where the Earthapos;s average temperature has been 7.5 degrees Celcuis hotter than it currently it is. You can also see that in the span of the past 10,000 years the temperature has leveld off, but you may ask yourself where does that place us in the lights of modern day?  I am going to site Dr. Done Easterbrook, who is a climate scientist. Back in 2000 he predicted that Earth was entering a cooling phase. He predicts that for the next 20 years Earth will cool by 3/10 degree each year and that we are going to enter another little Ice Age like we did from 1650 and 1790. (3) The funny thing is that many of my opponentapos;s charts are actually from the incorrect IPPC. How about the quot;Hockey Stickquot; graph that many Global Warming supporters , including my opponent, argue about? Well if we observe the fallowing chart taken from Northern Scandenavia we can see that the Global trend over the past 1,000 years that the Global Cooling trend slope is that of -0.31 Degrees Celcuis, give or take 0.03 degrees (for the error room). Professor Dr. Jan Esper has found that the Earthapos;s temperature of Earth actually decreases 0.3 per millenia due to the Earth moving away from the sun. (4)   Here is another graph from 1920 to 2005 and we can see that the graph has a negative temperature slope, thus meaning that the Earth is under a period of cooling. (5)  You can see in terms of more Warming in the evidence in which Scientists use Ice Cores Earth has actually been Cooling the past Mellenium.  Finailly, lets bring up just how much these accused compounds exactly warm the Earthapos;s atmosphere. CO2 for example has the global warming potential of 1. Here are the other numbers. Carbon Dioxide -- 1Methane -- 21Nitrous Oxide -- 298-310CFCapos;s -- VariousWater Vapor -- 0.25  Now I just want you to keep this in mind for this next part here. We may observe that humans release approximately 35 gigatons of CO2 a year. [14] This is only 4.3% of the total amount of all Global Warming Gasses, however it is incrediably small when it comes to comparing the rest of the Global Warming gasses. If we observe the chart bellow we can see that Water Vapor is a large Contributor to Global Warming at 95% and CO2 comes in second. But hereapos;s the kicker. If we look at the Human contributed part that Iapos;m about to post in the graph bellow we can see that itapos;s very miniscule of 0.117% of all total Warming gasses. Now letapos;s do some quick math here. CO2apos;s increase was from what my opponent is claiming is from 295 ppm to 400ppm, a total of only 105 ppm. 1 Gigaton of CO2 is the equilivent of 2.13 ppm. [15] This means that increase of 105 ppm means a total of 49.29 gigatons. Since 1 gigaton of CO2 is the equivilance of .004% of the Greenhouse effect that means that 49.29 gigatons means an aditional .21% increase to Global Warming. This would account for a grand total of a 0.15 F increase in global temperature. This is a very measly amount and we can see that with my opponentapos;s claims a simple 0.15 F increase isnapos;t enough to melt glacers and have the effeccts that he is speaking of and it proves that this is NAUTRAL not man-made to fulfil his effects if they were real. Now remind yourself that this debate is about humans creating a LARGE amount of Global Warming, not a miniscule amount. You can see that in terms of Gasses contribution to the Green House Effect the major contributer is Water Vapor and itapos;s at 95% to CO2apos;s 3.6% and this is the overall contribution including man made and natural. When we look to the chart on the left we can see that Man-Made CO2 does have a higher contribution to the atmosphere than Water Vapor, but thatapos;s because we do not create much water vapor as humans. Even with this evidence we can see that CO2 does not have any effect what-so-ever compared to Water Vapor. (6) Where might those CFCs be on this graph you may ask. Why itapos;s under the Misc. gases section. Contention 3: Artic Ice. Al Gore stated that the Artic Ice would be completely melted by 2014, but he is incorrect then and now.  Jan. 6, 2012: The Coast Guard Cutter Healy breaks ice around the Russian-flagged tanker Renda 250 miles south of Nome. The Healy is the Coast Guard’s only currently operating polar icebreaker. The vessels are transiting through ice up to five-feet thick in this area. The 370-foot tanker Renda will have to go through more than 300 miles of sea ice to get to Nome, a city of about 3,500 people on the western Alaska coastline that did not get its last pre-winter fuel delivery because of a massive storm. (7) Letapos;s go back to 2007-2008 and see if his claim was justified in the Artic Ice activity.  Hmmm... It seems that he is incorrect, but letapos;s look further into the near past. How about 2012-2013? (8) We all remember the Climate Scientists that got stuck in Arctic Ice Earlier last year correct? Then a Russian Ice Breaker tried to free them, but got stuck. Can you guess what they were studying? They had predicted that all the Arctic Ice had melted due to Global Warming and that Earth would get flooded massively. Boy were they wrong. (9)  (10)  Dr. Koonin, former head of the Department of Energy under President Obama, has stated that the Global Warming scare is not suttle. This is because that he has found 3 things wrong and highly incorrect about the scare. 1. Shrinking of Artic Sea ice doesnapos;t acount for the gaining of the Antartic ice. 2. The warming of Earthapos;s temps today is the same as it was 30 years ago. 3. The sea levels rose at the same height and rate in the 20th cenury. (11)  Contention 4: Sea Levels Here is another corralation that must happen. If the Ice Caps are completely melted as many GW advocates claim then the sea level would have risen completely drowning tons of land.  The graph above is raw satellite image data of the sea level rise over an 8 year period showing that there is little to no change in the Sea Levels rising. (12) The sea level rises, on average, about 3 inches per century and it has been found to not even been rising at all.  This graph is the sea levels off the cost of French Guyana which is one of the areas which is predicted to be flooded due to Global Warming, but as you can see by the graph (which goes to 2008) the sea level is currently on a downward trend. (13) The source is the PDF within the link.Contention 5: The WeatherMany Global Warming Advocates claim that Hurricanes are increasing due to Global Warming, but this claim is indeed false! The hurricanes since the year 1900 to 2008 have actually been decreasing. The slope of this downward slope is .0016. Though it is small the hurricanes are still in a downward trend.As a matter of fact not only are Hurricanes on a downward trend, but they are at an all time low as in the year 2010, there was only 68 Hurricanes Globally, which is an all time low in the past 40 years. How about Tornados you may ask?In the graph above you can see that tornados are at an all time low in the past 60 years! (14) But what about Hurricanes?Here is a graph showing the number of days between hurricanes and this shows that the number of days between hurricanes is greatest at 76 days between hurricanes.The slope of this line is zero showing no trend of a massive storm increase.

  <pair id="354" entailment="NONENTAILMENT" task="IE">
    <t>Contention 1: No major/any CO2 IncreaseFirstly I would like to point out a huge drop from my last round. This was my just how much of each of the Green House Gasses actually contribute and how much of them actually are from man made. Letapos;s run those percentages one more time. Water Vapor---0.001%CO2---0.117%Methane---0.066%N2O---0.047%Misc. (including CFCs)---0.047%We can see here that these percentages are indeed quite low and this was dropped by my opponent so I extend them across the board.     Let us observe the above graph. Here I would like to point out the that the increase from Pre-Inustrial to Industrial era and the doubling of the CO2 leveling lead to a decrease in itapos;s temperature. Also we can see that the 10 mile quot;hot-spotquot; above the tropics is actually absent. quot;The computer models show that greenhouse warming will cause a hot-spot at an altitude between 8 and 12 km over the tropics between 30 N and 30 S. The temperature at this hot-spot is projected to increase at a rate of two to three times faster than at the surface. However, the Hadley Centreapos;s real-world plot of radiosonde temperature observations shown below does not show the projected CO2 induced global warming hot-spot at all. The predicted hot-spot is entirely absent from the observational record. This shows that atmosphere warming theory programmed into climate models are wrong.quot; [1]If we observe the above Greenland Ice Core we can see that though itapos;s been heating up we can swee that on average itapos;s a whole lot colder than what it is on a normal basis. This is also acknowledging that humans have only been around in the past 10,000 years or so we can see that this Ice Core is still colder than normal even with the emmission that are produced today. Now if we observe the above graph of the past 400,000 yeasrs we can see that the CO2 rates in our atmosphere has flutated the exact same way in this cycle both before and during the existance of human beings. We can see that the temperatures and CO2 levels have been going up and down randomly for the past 100 thousands years and it is observed that this occured before the industrial revolution. We can also see that right now we are in a warming period so that arguing that humans are because of this is post hoc. Not to mention that we are in the coldest of the warming periods in Earthapos;s history! Hence this reveals that this whole Global Warming is just a cycle that Earth is expierencing. We can see that once again despite contrary to belief we can see that though there may be warming the fact is simply that there is no human warming.I also appologize for using evidence that has expired. Could you tell me which one and Iapos;ll post it in the comments section. Thanks. Contention 2: Earth is Cooling  Youapos;re probably asking yourself, why am I seeing this graph again? This is because the more CO2 we get the less warming there is. If we observe this graph we can see that the Warming has decreased with more CO2 that weapos;ve recieved. This shows that CO2 doesnapos;t have that much of an impact on the tempterature like the math that Iapos;ve proved it in my last contention. [2]  Now I will agree that Eastbrook isnapos;t good with predicting temperature change, but the IPCC is even worse, but whatever is causing the change it is highly unlikely that itapos;s man made. Once again we can see that the IPCC and Al Gore are inccorect as the hocky stick graph is a bust. As Iapos;ve shown in earlier rounds and they have been dropped in showing that the Earthapos;s temperature has indeed been way hotter then current and on an average basis at that. My opponent has also dropped my opening graph in C1 r2 That also showed that CO2 levels are at an all time low! Thus once again disproving my opponentapos;s theory.Here we can see that even though CO2 levels are increaseing that the temperature in recent years has actually decreased on the linear scale. Also the US Senate Committe on Envirnment and public works also took a stab at this issue. They found that the Hocky Stick graph was also bogus in 2006. “Today’s NAS report reaffirms what I have been saying all along, that Mannapos;s ‘hockey stick’ is broken,”Senator Inhofe said.“Today’s report refutes Mannapos;s prior assertions that there was no Medieval Warm Period or Little Ice Age.” “This report shows that the planet warmed for about 200 years prior to the industrial age, when we were coming out of the depths of the Little Ice Age where harsh winters froze the Thames and caused untold deaths. “Trying to prove man-made global warming by comparing the well-known fact that todayapos;s temperatures are warmer than during the Little Ice Age is akin to comparing summer to winter to show a catastrophic temperature trend.” [3]Here we can see that theyapos;ve found that this warming of the similiar to what my opponent is trying to prove is actually indeed bogus. Paleoclimate scientist Bob Carter had shown through his research at University of East Angila in the United Kingdom that the Climate Change increase had actually froze from 1998-2006 showing that this so called Global Warming had actually stopped. [4]  My opponent tries to claim that I am a hypocrate, but he is yet twisting my own words. Iapos;m showing that thereapos;s none if not barely little warming and that Water Vapor is a key part of it. He fails to see that I showed that how much water vapor is when I showed the equation in my last round in Contention 1, so my opponentapos;s tangent is irrelivant here. Contention 3: Artic Ice and Sea Level.I do appologize. Let me bring up other evidence since my last round apparently wasnapos;t good enough though I sited NASA of all organizations.   THough my opponent likes to blow things out of perportion we can see that these sea levels rise and fall on their own. Itapos;s a natural cycle as I showed last round. The trend shows only a mere +/- 0.30 mm per year. quot;The Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory estimates the rate of sea level rise at 1.42 plus or minus 0.14 mm/year for the period 1954 to 2003. This is less than the estimate of 1.91 plus or minus 0.14 mm/year for the period 1902 to 1953, indicating a slowing of the rate.quot; [5] We can see that 2.8 inches per 50 years isnapos;t that much of an appocolyptic threat.  Here is a graph from NOAA which shows that the sea level rise is very small and that the IPCC is way off as well as many other Warming quot;expertsquot;. [6]  In the above graph we can see that despit Artic Ice slightly decreasing we can see that it follows the same patern throughout the year as the Ice melts in the summer and freezes in the winter. We can see that my opponentsapos; sea ice level predictions are incorrect. [7] Which if sea ice is decreasing then explain the great sea ice exspansion of Antartica in 2012 shown bellow. It had a total of 20,000 miles more ice than average.  The graph bellow is proof of the cycle of what Iapos;m talking about. Plus even if it was caused by Global Warming my opponent still has to prove that it was caused by HUMANS in order to take the win here not to show that it exists.According studies done by Ola Johannessen we can see that the Greenland Ice Sheet is growing! Also we can see from the same study is that the Artic was actually warmer in the 1930apos;s than today! [8]I also extend across all of my previous arguments for this Contention.Contention 4: Storms  The NOAA has shown that Tornados are less frequent and occur less and less.  [9] I continue to extend across my NOAA Hurricane graph from last round.If we observe the above graph we can see that there is no net increase in violent Hurricanes nor their wind speed. We can see that my includes more years and hence more data which disproves my opponents. Plus when you add in my R2 graph, which was unrefuted, you can see that there is zero if not a decreasing trend when it comes to hurricanes. My graphs are just some imaginary data and I shall extend them all across the board.  Sources1. (http://www.friendsofscience.org...)2. (http://www.friendsofscience.org...)3.

    <t>In this debate Iapos;m going to be arguing that Global Warming is anthropogenic.C1: Carbon dioxide causes warmingCarbon dioxide has been identified as having apos;greenhouseapos; qualities for over a century[1]. The greenhouse effect occurs when GHGs allow shortwave solar radiation to pass through the atmosphere. This energy is absorbed of the earth, and then radiates this heat as infrared radiation. This is usually referred to as outgoing longwave radiation. This theory is particularly well-explained in this diagram.This means that a with more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, we should observe lower levels of this longwave radiation escaping into space the the wavelengths carbon dioxide is meant to absorb. This was recorded by the IRIS satellite and later confirmed by the IMG satellite over a 26 year period. The paper concluded that the experiment could be considered quot;direct experimental evidence for a significant increase in the Earthapos;s greenhouse effectquot;[2]. This same experiment has been adapted multiple times in order to measure downward longwave radiation from the ground[3][4]. This empirical evidence is unequivocal.Another way line of empirical reasoning that supports carbon dioxideapos;s effect on the climate is through historic instances of climate change. This paper quantified the equilibrium temperature change in response to radiative forcing change, climate sensitivity, of the pre-anthropogenic eras[5]. The results of this analysis, were consistent with IPCC estimates. A 2 and 4.5°C global surface warming in response to doubled carbon dioxide.Just to really nail the coffin, Iapos;ll raise one further argument that determines a net positive feedback, in regard to climate sensitivity: modelling estimates. These work by calculating numerical data and predictions based on the physical, chemical and biological properties of its components, their interactions and feedback processes, and accounting for all or some of its known properties. A notable 2002 paper used a fingerprinting approach on modern temperature records and found a range of approximately 1.4 to 7.7°C [6]. A later model looked at paleontological data over the past 6 centuries to calculates a range 1.5 to 6.2°C [7]. This position is quite literally a platitude in any climate researchers books, since it is so well supported. This will be evident within my scientific consensus contention.[1] http://www.jstor.org...[2] http://www.nature.com...[3] http://www.agu.org...[4] http://www.agu.org...[5] http://www.nature.com...[6] http://www.sciencemag.org...[7] http://www.nature.com...C2: Humans are the source of the vast majority of resultant carbon dioxideThis figure shows the estimated balance of carbon dioxide emissions.Despite man made carbon dioxide emissions being comparatively smaller than natural emissions, the real driving force of climate change is the net quantity of carbon dioxide released, since most natural carbon emissions are absorbed[1]. Because of this, atmospheric carbon dioxide is at the highest levels in approximately 15 to 20 million years[2]. Many skeptics claim that historically, carbon dioxide levels have been much lower, particularly around 500-600 million years ago[3]. But the carbon dioxide level is not the only factor that affect global temperature[4]. Additionally, this position fails to account for the differences in solar activity, that was drastically different from current levels. This position also fails to explain why a comprehensive analysis of carbon dioxide levels over the last 540 millions years concluded that quot;Periods of low CO2 coincide with periods of geographically widespread ice.quot; This is clearly visible in this graph, where the shaded periods are periods of widespread ice.Many prominent climate science papers have argued that, if it were not for Natural contributions cooling the climate, we would be, in fact, a little hotter.Net human and natural percent contributions to the observed global surface warming over the past 50-65 years according to [6] (T00, dark blue), [7] (M04, red), [8] (S07, light green), [9] (LR08, purple), [10] (HK11, light blue), [11] (G12, orange), [12] (WS12, dark green), and [13] (J13, pink).[1] http://www.ipcc.ch...[2] http://www.sciencemag.org...[3] http://www.lavoisier.com.au...[4] http://www.ipcc.ch...[5] http://droyer.web.wesleyan.edu...(GCA).pdf[6] http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu...[7] http://journals.ametsoc.org...[8] http://journals.ametsoc.org...[9] http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu...[10] https://thingsbreak.files.wordpress.com...[11] https://thingsbreak.files.wordpress.com...[12] http://link.springer.com...[13] http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com...C3: There is a widespread, comprehensive scientific consensusThe contentions I have argued are not unfounded, flawed or bogus. In fact, they are so convincing that there exists a well-established scientific consensus.A recent survey of 12,000 climate science papers that expressed a position on the cause of global warming found that 97% of them agreed that anthropogenic global warming is occurring[1].The same survey found a historic strengthening of the Pro-AGW consensus since 1990.Another survey of 908 randomly selected climate scientists with more than 20 peer-reviewed publications settled upon a similar figure: quot;≈97% of self-identified actively publishing climate scientists agree with the tenets of anthropogenic climate changequot;[2]. My opponent might argue that the majority of papers expressed no position, therefore leaving room for a much weaker scientific consensus. This would fail to account, however, for the fact that the vast majority of papers included had already accepted AGW as a premise. Oreskes predicts this result, arguing that, quot;Scientists generally focus their discussions on questions that are still disputed or unanswered rather than on matters about which everyone agreesquot;[3].[1] http://iopscience.iop.org...[2] http://www.pnas.org...[3] https://www.lpl.arizona.edu...ConclusionI have shown that the climate is sensitive to increased levels of carbon dioxide, and that humans are the source of it. These positions are so well supported that an establish scientific consensus exists.Over to you, Con!</t>

    <t>GHG Ratios: This was not a huge drop. I had previously explained that that apos;weak warming caused by more carbon dioxide will lead to more water vapor in the atmosphere, which will then amplify the weak warming through water vapor’s role as the atmosphere’s primary greenhouse gas. Water vapour is responsible for much of the greenhouse effect, but only because warmer air masses, on average, contain more water vapor. In short, water vapour acts a feedback, not a forcing[1]apos; The quantities are irrelevant of water vapour are irrelevant when my contention regarding climate sensitivity remains unchallenged. Climate sensitivity is the crux of this debate, and if my opponent cannot refute my claims, he has essentially lost.Industrial CO2 Doubling: This next contention is unfounded and a bare assertion, so Iapos;m not going to waste character space rebutting it.Tropospheric Hot Spots: Con then claims that AGW models are invalidated by the lack of a tropospheric hot spot. There is a tropospheric hot spot. [2][3][4] Yet even if there were not, it would not disprove AGW because tropospheric occur regardless of heat source, as they are caused by lapse rates. [5] I.E. If the warming was caused by a brightening sun or reduced sulphate pollution, youapos;d still see a hot spot. All that the IPCC temperature signature in your source predicted was a greater forcing of temperature.Ice Core Cooling: Once again an unfounded and bare assertion, without any statistical backing. Iapos;ve shown in my previous contentions that warming is undoubtedly occurring, and those contentions have been dropped.Historic CO2 Fluctuations: Itapos;s upsetting that you donapos;t cite any sources, because this could be a good argument.[1] http://www.realclimate.org...[2] http://www.cgd.ucar.edu...[3] http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov...[4] http://www.nature.com...R2: None of this is especially relevant, Con is arguing about how good the IPCC are at forecasting temperature and long term climate sensitivity. I have proven that warming is occurring, and Con has not even touched by arguments. Con concedes Easterbrook was falsified, but then goes on to claim CO2 is at an all time low. As Iapos;ve previously mentioned: apos;Because of this, atmospheric carbon dioxide is at the highest levels in approximately 15 to 20 million years[1].

This is not relevant. You have conceded my rebuttals - sea levels are rising.[1] http://www.sciencemag.org...R4:The general consensus on this topic is inconclusive. I really donapos;t see itapos;s relevance. To win this debate, Con should have refuted my claims about and climate sensitivity, that is the crux of debate, and he has failed to do so. Con has consistently struggle to provide coherent positions and reliable evidence throughout the debate. Ultimately, the science is conclusive and much of my initial contentions have been dropped.Vote Pro!</t>

In 14th century,in Italy began the era of the Renaissance.The new thinking and new ideas superseded the belief that God had created the world and he was everything we should have strived for ,our paragon of virtue.In 1356 a yound woman accidentally discovered male and a famale body in the wood.She was very astute and quite interested in biology and realized thath men and women had the same number of ribs.According to The Bible ,God takes one rib away from women and gives it to men ,in order to make them more powerful than women.Later,this woman became the first person to contravene the mores and ideas of the church ,becoming the first doctor in the world.The Renaissance absolutely changed the view that God was omnipotent and that we were under his authority.This era gave the world writers like Dante and Bocacco ,artists and scientists like Leonardo da Vinci .These people decided to controvert the church and change the world.They made it better !  apos;The dreamersapos; is a novel , written by one of the most famous African writers Walter Uanda.The novel is about two brothers who dream of becoming politicians and changing the communistic regime of their country.Inspired by true events,the author recounts how the young boy is killed during a apos;peacefulapos; demonstration by the national army ; twenty years later ,his brother becomes tha first democratic president of the country.The champions the poor and influences smany African countries to stand against communism.He changed the African world for the better .  The world does not change in a constant rate.We choose how to change it ,and it depends on us if it will be changing for the better or for the worse.Since it`s inception ,the Earth has been evolving , and it keeps evolving at the moment ; we all hope it evolves for the better .  http://talk.collegeconfidential.com...</t>

    <t>Now, back onto the debate.____________________________________________________________________________________Thank you, lannan13, for that impressive response. Unfortunately, he has broken the rules by refuting my graphs and data I had put out in round 2:quot;Round 2: Opening arguments and Constructive Case, NO REBUTTALSquot; Iapos;m not sure if I should let it slide since this seems like my most fun debate, so that will be up to my opponent. I will first focus on rebuttals, then my contentions. Note that counter-rebuttals are now switched to this round as my opponent refuted my graphs in round 2, thus I must respond to these refutations or otherwise they will be seen as dropped.==Rebuttal 1: No Major/any Co2 increase==My opponentapos;s graph is a graph of Co2 levels over the past 600 million years. In contrast, my graph is a graph on Co2 levels only throughout the past 650,000 years. My opponentapos;s graph shows as time closes in on the present, the Co2 levels grow lower. However that is because we are looking at a much broader timeline and thus canapos;t see all the needed details in the graph. Yes, we are at an all time low, but that doesnapos;t mean Co2 levels arenapos;t increasing [1]:  I would like to point out that global warming doesnapos;t mandate warming all throughout Earthapos;s life. Global Warming happens anytime when Earthapos;s temperature substantially increases, and that is what is happening. If Co2 levels are increasing, mainly due to human activity, and Earthapos;s temperature rises at the same rate at the same time, then we already have good evidence man-made global warming exists.Also, it seems that my opponent uses a graph by Robert Berner. It is known that Bernerapos;s studies are very untrustworthy, especially this one. You can see in the following graph that his graph contains many errors [2]:quot;History of Atmospheric CO2 through geological time (past 550 million years: from Berner, Science,1997)... The shaded area encloses the approximate range of error of the modeling based on sensitivity analysis...quot; [2]My opponent then goes on to state that man-made global warming (or even global warming on general) does not exist simply because our Earth has been much hotter before, and then asks, quot;may I ask how did we survive that?quot; However this is a fallacy because:1.) I had already stated that global warming does not mandate a warming all throughout Earthapos;s life, and recently it has been increasing, even though if not by as much as older times. Also, under the circumstances, one degree is still quite substantial.2.) We could not survive in those times as the human race had not even come to being, let alone the dinosaur race. Plus, the animals and forms of life during those times were specially adapted to the hot climate. Also, this is irrelevant as we are only debating the existence of man-made global warming, not if we are going to survive it.3.) Because of the sun being dimmer than now, higher Co2 levels would be needed in order to keep the Earth at a bearable temperature, or else the Earth would literally freeze over. This contention is negated.==Rebuttal 2: The Earth is Actually Cooling==Again, I must remind my opponent that global warming does not mandate warming throughout Earthapos;s life. As you can see at the end of the graph, the temperature slightly increases back, thus proving global warmingapos;s existence, and, with the previous information I had given, man-made global warming as well. Just because the Earth has been hotter before doesnapos;t mean it isnapos;t warming again.When my opponent puts up his graph on the cooling of early 2000, again this is misleading, and Easterbrookapos;s predictions have gone wrong from the first 10 years of data collected on the graph. Yet my opponent claims the IPCC studies are incorrect, which is untrue. The evidence is here [3]:    “Figure 5: Don Easterbrookapos;s global temperature graphic presented during the 2010 Heartland conference.” Then, down lower on the cited website [3], it is said:  “So while the IPCC TAR projection was too high by about 0.12°C for the reasons discussed above [on cited website], Easterbrookapos;s projections were too low by 0.28°C and 0.58°C. Despite all of these non-greenhouse gas factors acting in the cooling direction over this timeframe, the IPCC projection was still much closer to reality than Easterbrookapos;s.” [3] On my opponent’s next graph, he shows that each millennium the Earth cools down by 0.3 degrees Celsius (0.54 degrees Fahrenheit) due to Earth’s motion away from the Sun. However, the study was conducted only for the last 2 millennia, when most of the millennia were basically Industrial Revolution and modern activity free. The IR started in 1790 [4]. At the end of the graph, the global temperature abruptly rises above the red line even before 2000, thus proving the existence of global warming, and man-made global warming. This is the same for my opponent’s next two graphs. My opponent’s last graph focuses on the contribution of the Greenhouse gases, and states that the contributions are very low. However that does not negate the existence of global warming or man-made global warming, it simply states that global warming is slow and weak. Thus, this contention is negated. ==Rebuttal 3: Arctic Ice and Sea levels== “First, I would like to state that Pro’s claim about the North Pole completely melting is bogus.” Never in this debate did I ever claim that. This is a straw-man. In my opponent’s Arctic Ice graphs, he shows that since nothing has happened to the Arctic Ice Sheet, global warming, and thus man-made global warming, cannot exist. However, again this is a straw-man since he simply takes a single photo for each year (which only shows the ice on a specific date) and then compares them. It is literally subjective to choose the worst of something on an earlier date and compare it with the best of something on a later specific date. For example, you could say that Whitney Houston is bad because she had an off-day, which is completely untrue. Also, although I don’t believe in all Arctic Ice melting, it is melting slowly and gradually [5]:  And here is a graph on gradually rising sea levels, contradicting my opponent’s [6]:    Thus this contention is negated and proved once again man-made global warming exists. ==Rebuttal 4: The Weather== “My opponent is claiming that Hurricanes are increasing due to Global Warming, but this claim is indeed false!” Again, never in the debate have I claimed that. What’s more, hurricanes aren’t actually linked to global warming in general [7]! “Hurricanes arenapos;t linked to global warming “According to the National Hurricane Center, storms are no more intense or frequent worldwide than they have been since 1850. […] Constant 24-7 media coverage of every significant storm worldwide just makes it seem that way.” (Paul Bedard)” [7] The story is similar for tornadoes as well [8]: “Global warming may well end up making them more frequent or intense, as our intuition would tell us. But it might also actually suppress them—the science just isnapos;t clear yet.” [8] Thus, either way, this contention doesn’t contradict anything about the existence of man-made global warming. ==Contention 3: Oceanic Acidification== A large portion of the Co2 emitted by the atmosphere is absorbed into the ocean. The more Co2 that is emitted into the atmosphere, the more is absorbed into the ocean, and thus the more acidified the ocean becomes [9]. This and warmer temperatures generally cause coral bleaching, which has happened more frequently recently due to its relatively narrow habitable temperature range [10].    Ocean acidification has increased by 30% since the Industrial Revolution [11]. This acidification can harm aquatic organisms, of which organisms that do not need oxygen take place and release greenhouse gases like methane, [12] thus proving that man-made global warming exists. ==Conclusion== I have refuted all my opponent’s arguments and have given out major information to support the existence of man-made global warming. Thus, the resolution stands affirmed.

    <t>I hate it when links are broken...http://www.skepticalscience.com...If this doesnapos;t work, click on the original link and take off the extra space at the end of the link in the URL bar. I actually quoted the wrong part of this website by mistake. I was meant to quote quot;It is unclear whether global warming is increasing hurricane frequency but there is increasing evidence that warming increases hurricane intensity.quot;Also, apologies for writing Carbon Dioxide as Co2 (Cobalt2, as my adversary points out). Itapos;s just the way I grew up writing it.Moving on...____________________________________________________________________________________==Counter 1: Co2 and its effects==quot;Now remind yourself that Pro said in Round 2 that CO2 is responsable for LARGE amount of Global Warming.quot; - OpponentIapos;m not sure where I said this. I ask my adversary to quote from me.In fact, my opponentapos;s entire rebuttal for this argument is misleading. It is subjective to use only Co2 as a base for a rebuttal against the resolution. If we were to count all the other causes of the greenhouse effect, then it is very possible to conclude that this can heat Earth by more than just 0.15 degrees Fahrenheit. My opponent even concedes that there is a warming caused by anthropogenic emissions, but then states that it is very low. That isnapos;t what his BoP wants. To fulfill it, he must disprove the entirety of anthropogenic global warming.quot;Since 1 gigaton of CO2 is the equivilance of .004% of the Greenhouse effect that means that 49.29 gigatons means an aditional .21% increase to Global Warming. This would account for a grand total of a 0.15 F increase in global temperature.quot; - OpponentNot only have Co2 levels increased, but there are steep increases in other greenhouse gases as well [1]:Be reminded that there is already a correlation between Earthapos;s temperature and Co2 levels, and that the rates of circular cooling and warming, and increase/decrease of Co2 levels have stopped and started to rise severely [2]:We cannot use my opponentapos;s graph which suggests the contrary to the temperatures above, as it only uses data from Georgia [3], a state in the United States of America [4]. There is literally a direct contradiction between my adversaryapos;s chart (from 1990, Georgia) and mine (1880, worldwide).Atmospheric concentrations of Co2 and anthropogenic emissions of Co2 have a correlation as well [5]: My opponent then goes on to review a graph on the logarithmic effects of increased carbon dioxide levels. Even if this is true, by my opponentapos;s logic there is still a warming effect. It just gets smaller, but not negative. We canapos;t say that the warming effect is slower to disprove the entirety of anthropogenic global warming, because that is fallacious and invalid, and ends up failing to fulfill the real BoP here.==Counter 2: The earth is actually cooling==People and websites have actually shown the hot-spot absence to be fake. According to Skeptical Science, the absence of the hot-spot could be due to the errors in the processing of data [6]:quot;Satellite measurements match model results apart from in the tropics. There is uncertainty with the tropic data due to how various teams correct for satellite drift. The U.S. Climate Change Science Program conclude the discrepancy is most likely due to data errors.quot; - Skeptical Science [6]quot;Allen and Sherwood sought to side step the problems associated with the radiosonde data entirely, and examined the “dynamical relationship known as the thermal-wind equation, which relates horizontal temperature gradients to wind shear”. Thermal wind speed data, in contrast to the temperature data, lacked many of the systematic adjustment issues and other errors, and were used as a proxy for temperature. Allen and Sherwood found that the troposphere appeared to be warming in reasonable agreement to theoretical and modeling expectations.quot; - Skeptical Science [6]The IPCC projections are actually considered to be quite accurate, in comparison to both of Easterbrookapos;s projections [7] (animation of both comparisons, then together):quot;All of the IPCC projections have proven to be quite accurate, suggesting high reliability.  The contrarian projections all underestimate the global warming substantially, and in fact they erroneously predict global cooling and are quite unreliable.quot; - Skeptical Science [7]==Counter 3: Arctic Ice and Sea Levels==Note that the rise and fall of the data represents sea level CHANGE RATES, not the sea level itself. The majority of the data is above zero, meaning that on average the sea level, even if minimally, is rising.In fact, the sea level rise is actually accelerating quite quickly [8]:quot;A variety of different measurements find steadily rising sea levels over the past century.quot; - Skeptical Science [8]quot;The trend shows only a mere +/- 0.30 mm per year. quot;The Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory estimates the rate of sea level rise at 1.42 plus or minus 0.14 mm/year for the period 1954 to 2003. This is less than the estimate of 1.91 plus or minus 0.14 mm/year for the period 1902 to 1953, indicating a slowing of the rate.quot; [6] We can see that 2.8 inches per 50 years isnapos;t that much of an appocolyptic threat.quot; - OpponentThis is irrelevant. We are debating whether anthropogenic global warming exists, not if it is dangerous or not. The existence of something  does not mandate an argument of how safe it is.My opponent actually concedes that there is a rise, but again tries to save his stance on the argument by saying that it is minimal, which again isnapos;t the point. By my opponentapos;s logic, if man-made global warming exists, sea levels should not rise at all, to which he has conceded the contrary. Thus my opponent concedes this entire point.Also, although Arctic sea ice extent does follow a pattern, it is still gradually decreasing [9]: Although I will concede the Antarctic ice is expanding, the arctic is losing ice more than twice as fast than the Antarctic is gaining ice [10][11].quot;Since the late 1970s, the Arctic has lost an average of 20,800 square miles (53,900 square kilometers) of ice a year; the Antarctic has gained an average of 7,300 square miles (18,900 sq km).quot; - NASA [10]==Counter 4: Hurricanes and Tornadoes==I had already proven that tornadoes are not linked to global warming whatsoever, so this argument has been debunked. The hurricane argument has been re-responded to.To reinforce the fact that hurricanes are getting more intense however, here is a graph showing the increase of more intense hurricanes over time [12]:quot;Higher surface temperatures of the worldapos;s oceans could be responsible for the big rise in the strength of hurricanes, say US scientists.quot; - Physicsworld.com [12]==Counter 5: Ocean Acidification==Although it is correct that ocean acidification is not yet at a critical level, it is acidifying very rapidly. It is predicted that by 2100 the ocean will have a pH as low as 7.8 [13]:quot;Currently, there are no known natural explanations for the observed decline in GLOBAL AVERAGE ocean pH, and, there is one, clear human-caused explanation (note the global bit is important - there is natural local variation in pH but we are concerned with global shifts).quot; - Switchboard [13]Since the ocean is acidifying, the organisms in the ocean will slowly die out, for anaerobic organisms to replace them and emit gases such as methane, as shown in the last round.==Conclusion==I have effectively refuted all my opponentapos;s claims and have shown how my opponent has essentially conceded. Thus the resolution is affirmed.[1] http://www.natsoc.org.au...[2] http://www.ukccsc.co.uk...[3] http://en.wikipedia.org...[4] http://www.lawrencevilleweather.com...[5] http://www.lawrencevilleweather.com...[6] http://www.skepticalscience.com...[7] http://www.skepticalscience.com...[8] http://www.skepticalscience.com...[9] http://www.carbonbrief.org...[10] http://www.nasa.gov...[11/video] https://www.youtube.com...[12] http://physicsworld.com...[13] http://switchboard.nrdc.org...</t>

    <t>Okay thanks, it works now. Thatapos;s okay, but scientifically the O has to be capitalized, because if you donapos;t itapos;s Cobalt2. Hence Cobalt is Co and Carbon Dioxide is CO2, so please remember to wirte it correct, thanks!Contention 1: CO2 and its effects. I deeply appologize for mistaking for what my opponent had stated as it came from my opponentapos;s 7th source in his second round, but letapos;s move on.The fact is that the Warming from itapos;s effects are so microscopic that it does not cause the effects that my opponent has brought up and to mention that he has DROPPED this portion stating how much Warming Gasses come from humans and itapos;s very microscopic.  Iapos;ll be posting that graph bellow.  Now once again if we look at this chart we can see that the gasses that are these Warming gasses and compare it to how much mankind has contributed to the Warming equation we can see that it is very microscopic at best and has no impact upon the globe as it is just so small and microscopic. This is an important point that my opponent dropped as it shows that humans are not contributing to Global Warming, but rather something else is. Prehaps is the cows whoapos;s manuer produces more methane now for some strange reason? Just in case the graph doesnapos;t post Iapos;ll post itapos;s information bellow. GAS -- GREENHOUSE EFFECT -- HUMAN EFFECTWater Vapor ------ 95.000% -- 0.001%Carbon Dioxide -- 3.618% ---- 0.117%Methane ----------- 0.360 ------ 0.066%Nitrous oxide ------ 0.950% ---- 0.047%Misc ----------------- 0.072% ---- 0.047%Total ----------------- 100% ------- 0.278%  [1]Remeber the Warming numbers that I have posted last round that CO2 is the equilivence to 1 GWP. We can also see that my Numbers that Iapos;ve allowed for my calculations were more moddested as it showed more of an increase than my opponent is showing and that was from one of his earlier graphs. Once again itapos;s a 0.15 F increase of temperature and thatapos;s assuming thereapos;s a 105 ppm increase compared to the mere 40 ppm increase that my opponent has shown which means that the temperature under these numbers would drop to around 0.06 F. Again there isnapos;t a large enough amount of emmitions produced from humans to cause a great difference in a global meltdown that my opponent is predictings. If we observe the above Greenland Ice Core we can see that though itapos;s been heating up we can swee that on average itapos;s a whole lot colder than what it is on a normal basis. This is also acknowledging that humans have only been around in the past 10,000 years or so we can see that this Ice Core is still colder than normal even with the emmission that are produced today. Now if we observe the above graph of the past 400,000 yeasrs we can see that the CO2 rates in our atmosphere has flutated the exact same way in this cycle both before and during the existance of human beings. We can see that the temperatures and CO2 levels have been going up and down randomly for the past 100 thousands years and it is observed that this occured before the industrial revolution. We can also see that right now we are in a warming period so that arguing that humans are because of this is post hoc. Not to mention that we are in the coldest of the warming periods in Earthapos;s history! We can see that once again despite contrary to belief we can see that though there may be warming the fact is simply that there is no human warming.What Iapos;m showing on my logerithum is that there is no corrilation to what my opponent is stating and this shows that more CO2 doesnapos;t harm the atmosphere and destroy it like that of what my opponent is stating. Contention 2: Earth is cooling.My opponent drops the hot spot argument so weapos;ll move on to the next argument. Once again we can see that the IPCC and Al Gore are inccorect as the hocky stick graph is a bust. As Iapos;ve shown in earlier rounds and they have been dropped in showing that the Earthapos;s temperature has indeed been way hotter then current and on an average basis at that. My opponent has also dropped my opening graph in C1 r2 That also showed that CO2 levels are at an all time low! Thus once again disproving my opponentapos;s theory.Here we can see that even though CO2 levels are increaseing that the temperature in recent years has actually decreased on the linear scale. Also the US Senate Committe on Envirnment and public works also took a stab at this issue. They found that the Hocky Stick graph was also bogus in 2006. “Today’s NAS report reaffirms what I have been saying all along, that Mannapos;s ‘hockey stick’ is broken,”Senator Inhofe said. “Today’s report refutes Mannapos;s prior assertions that there was no Medieval Warm Period or Little Ice Age.” “This report shows that the planet warmed for about 200 years prior to the industrial age, when we were coming out of the depths of the Little Ice Age where harsh winters froze the Thames and caused untold deaths. “Trying to prove man-made global warming by comparing the well-known fact that todayapos;s temperatures are warmer than during the Little Ice Age is akin to comparing summer to winter to show a catastrophic temperature trend.” [2]Here we can see that theyapos;ve found that this warming of the similiar to what my opponent is trying to prove is indeed bogus. Paleoclimate scientist Bob Carter had shown through his research at University of East Angila in the United Kingdom that the Climate Change increase had actually froze from 1998-2006 showing that this so called Global Warming had actually stopped. [3]  Contention 3: Artic Ice and Sea Levels.I do not concede the arugment as it shows that there is a plus or minus .3 mm increase or decrease each year which as Iapos;ve shown in previous graphs in previous rounds that itapos;s a cycle. The graph bellow is proof of the cycle of what Iapos;m talking about. Plus even if it was caused by Global Warming my opponent still has to prove that it was caused by HUMANS in order to take the win here not to show that it exists.According studies done by Ola Johannessen we can see that the Greenland Ice Sheet is growing! Also we can see from the same study is that the Artic was actually warmer in the 1930apos;s than today! [4]s://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com...; alt=quot;quot; /gt;Here we can see that the Antartic Ice has been increasing recently, but you may ask what about the Artic Lannan? Well letapos;s look.s://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com...; alt=quot;quot; /gt;Well Iapos;ll be, not only is the artic ice growing, but itapos;s getting thicker and thicker. According to studies we can see that if we tack on one more year to my opponentapos;s graph we can see that he fails to tell you that from August 2012 to August 2013 that the Artic Ice grew 533,000 square miles and this is according to NASA charts.Contention 4: Hurricane and TornadosIf we observe the above graph we can see that there is no net increase in violent Hurricanes nor their wind speed. We can see that my includes more years and hence more data which disproves my opponents. Plus when you add in my R2 graph, which was unrefuted, you can see that there is zero if not a decreasing trend when it comes to hurricanes.Contention 5: Ocean AcidificationClimatoligist Rodger Pielke sr. has found that in the past when the Ocean has gained heat the Ocean has lost that heat within 2 years of which it was gained. Who has been quoted saying, quot;certainly indicates that the multi-decadal global climate models have serious issues with their ability to accurately simulate the response of the climate system to human- and natural-climate forcings.quot; [5] This shows that the Ocean cannot be gaining this gaining an over exaggerated amount of CO2 causing the acidification that my opponent has been claiming. We can actually see that my opponentapos;s graph actually fits within the amount of pH varriation that I have stated last round which further prooves my point. Sources1.

    <t>Contention 1: No Major/any CO2 Increase.      Many Global Warming advocates state that CO2 levels are skyrocketing, but that is incorrect. I give you the above graph measuring the past 600 million years of CO2 levels are we are actually at an all time low. Now the website I got this from no longer has this page up so I appologize. We can see from observance of this graph that we being at all time CO2 low levles that we are nowhere close to meeting the impact that my opponent brings up. We have been over 5,000 ppm of CO2 in our atmosphere and are now currently around apprx. 350 ppm CO2 levels.  The above graph shows that comparisions of C13 (Carbon isotope) and this shows that there is little to no trend pertrade in many of these as the average is zero while the trend for all of these are zero. (1) This is important as the Carbon isotope is important in measuring this so called quot;Global Warming.quot;  This chart above shows the CO2 and Earthapos;s temperatures for the past 600 million years. My opponentapos;s claims are incorect as we have had aburd levels of CO2 and temperature on Earth and may I ask how did we survive that? (2) Now I will move on to how Earth is actually cooling and how itapos;s temperature is cooler than it has been. Contention 2: Earth is cooling.  If we observe the above graph we can see that Earth has been a whole lot hotter than where we currently are to the point where the Earthapos;s average temperature has been 7.5 degrees Celcuis hotter than it currently it is. You can also see that in the span of the past 10,000 years the temperature has leveld off, but you may ask yourself where does that place us in the lights of modern day?  I am going to site Dr. Done Easterbrook, who is a climate scientist. Back in 2000 he predicted that Earth was entering a cooling phase. He predicts that for the next 20 years Earth will cool by 3/10 degree each year and that we are going to enter another little Ice Age like we did from 1650 and 1790. (3) The funny thing is that many of my opponentapos;s charts are actually from the incorrect IPPC. How about the quot;Hockey Stickquot; graph that many Global Warming supporters , including my opponent, argue about? Well if we observe the fallowing chart taken from Northern Scandenavia we can see that the Global trend over the past 1,000 years that the Global Cooling trend slope is that of -0.31 Degrees Celcuis, give or take 0.03 degrees (for the error room). Professor Dr. Jan Esper has found that the Earthapos;s temperature of Earth actually decreases 0.3 per millenia due to the Earth moving away from the sun. (4)   Here is another graph from 1920 to 2005 and we can see that the graph has a negative temperature slope, thus meaning that the Earth is under a period of cooling. (5)  You can see in terms of more Warming in the evidence in which Scientists use Ice Cores Earth has actually been Cooling the past Mellenium. You can see that in terms of Gasses contribution to the Green House Effect the major contributer is Water Vapor and itapos;s at 95% to CO2apos;s 3.6% and this is the overall contribution including man made and natural. When we look to the chart on the left we can see that Man-Made CO2 does have a higher contribution to the atmosphere than Water Vapor, but thatapos;s because we do not create much water vapor as humans. Even with this evidence we can see that CO2 does not have any effect what-so-ever compared to Water Vapor. (6) Where might those CFCs be on this graph you may ask. Why itapos;s under the Misc. gases section. Contention 3: Artic Ice. First, I would like to state that Proapos;s claim about the North Pole completely melting is bogus. Al Gore stated that the Artic Ice would be completely melted by 2014, but he is incorrect then and now.  Jan. 6, 2012: The Coast Guard Cutter Healy breaks ice around the Russian-flagged tanker Renda 250 miles south of Nome. The Healy is the Coast Guard’s only currently operating polar icebreaker. The vessels are transiting through ice up to five-feet thick in this area. The 370-foot tanker Renda will have to go through more than 300 miles of sea ice to get to Nome, a city of about 3,500 people on the western Alaska coastline that did not get its last pre-winter fuel delivery because of a massive storm. (7) Letapos;s go back to 2007-2008 and see if his claim was justified in the Artic Ice activity.  Hmmm... It seems that he is incorrect, but letapos;s look further into the near past. How about 2012-2013? (8) We all remember the Climate Scientists that got stuck in Arctic Ice Earlier last year correct? Then a Russian Ice Breaker tried to free them, but got stuck. Can you guess what they were studying? They had predicted that all the Arctic Ice had melted due to Global Warming and that Earth would get flooded massively. Boy were they wrong. (9)  (10)  Dr. Koonin, former head of the Department of Energy under President Obama, has stated that the Global Warming scare is not suttle. This is because that he has found 3 things wrong and highly incorrect about the scare. 1. Shrinking of Artic Sea ice doesnapos;t acount for the gaining of the Antartic ice. 2. The warming of Earthapos;s temps today is the same as it was 30 years ago. 3. The sea levels rose at the same height and rate in the 20th cenury. (11)  Contention 4: Sea Levels  Here is another corralation that must happen. If the Ice Caps are completely melted as Pro claims then the sea level would have risen completely drowning tons of land.  The graph above is raw satellite image data of the sea level rise over an 8 year period showing that there is little to no change in the Sea Levels rising. (12) The sea level rises, on average, about 3 inches per century and it has been found to not even been rising at all.  This graph is the sea levels off the cost of French Guyana which is one of the areas which is predicted to be flooded due to Global Warming, but as you can see by the graph (which goes to 2008) the sea level is currently on a downward trend. (13) The source is the PDF within the link.Contention 5: The Weather My opponent is claiming that Hurricanes are increasing due to Global Warming, but this claim is indeed false! The hurricanes since the year 1900 to 2008 have actually been decreasing. The slope of this downward slope is .0016. Though it is small the hurricanes are still in a downward trend.As a matter of fact not only are Hurricanes on a downward trend, but they are at an all time low as in the year 2010, there was only 68 Hurricanes Globally, which is an all time low in the past 40 years. How about Tornados you may ask?In the graph above you can see that tornados are at an all time low in the past 60 years! (14) But what about Hurricanes?Here is a graph showing the number of days between hurricanes and this shows that the number of days between hurricanes is greatest at 76 days between hurricanes.The slope of this line is zero showing no trend of a massive storm increase.

    <t>My opponent agreed that the rule violation is a misunderstanding (see comments section). Whether you want to leave it alone or make it a conduct loss is up to the voters.  Now letapos;s get to the debate. I also appologize if I do not get to everything ahead of time as I will likely run out of characters. Contention 1: CO2 and Temperatures. Firstly let bring up just how much these accused compounds exactly warm the Earthapos;s atmosphere. CO2 for example has the global warming potential of 1. Here are the other numbers. Carbon Dioxide -- 1Methane -- 21Nitrous Oxide -- 298-310CFCapos;s -- VariousWater Vapor -- 0.25 [1] Now I just want you to keep this in mind for this next part here. We may observe that humans release approximately 35 gigatons of CO2 a year. [2] This is only 4.3% of the total amount of all Global Warming Gasses, however it is incrediably small when it comes to comparing the rest of the Global Warming gasses. If we observe the chart bellow we can see that Water Vapor is a large Contributor to Global Warming at 95% and CO2 comes in second. But hereapos;s the kicker. If we look at the Human contributed part that Iapos;m about to post in the graph bellow we can see that itapos;s very miniscule of 0.117% of all total Warming gasses. Now letapos;s do some quick math here. CO2apos;s increase was from what my opponent is claiming is from 295 ppm to 400ppm, a total of only 105 ppm. 1 Gigaton of CO2 is the equilivent of 2.13 ppm. [3] This means that increase of 105 ppm means a total of 49.29 gigatons. Since 1 gigaton of CO2 is the equivilance of .004% of the Greenhouse effect that means that 49.29 gigatons means an aditional .21% increase to Global Warming. This would account for a grand total of a 0.15 F increase in global temperature. This is a very measly amount and we can see that with my opponentapos;s claims a simple 0.15 F increase isnapos;t enough to melt glacers and have the effeccts that he is speaking of and it proves that this is NAUTRAL not man-made to fulfil his effects if they were real. Now remind yourself that Pro said in Round 2 that CO2 is responsable for LARGE amount of Global Warming. As we can plainly see here that this is incorrect.  My opponent goes and attempts to manipulate data by showing back as far as 1955, but when we push things back to the year 1900 we can see that temperature levels are actually decreasing on a linear slope.    Let us observe the above graph. Here I would like to point out the that the increase from Pre-Inustrial to Industrial era and the doubling of the CO2 leveling lead to a decrease in itapos;s temperature.  Also we can see that the 10 mile quot;hot-spotquot; above the tropics is actually absent. quot;The computer models show that greenhouse warming will cause a hot-spot at an altitude between 8 and 12 km over the tropics between 30 N and 30 S. The temperature at this hot-spot is projected to increase at a rate of two to three times faster than at the surface. However, the Hadley Centreapos;s real-world plot of radiosonde temperature observations shown below does not show the projected CO2 induced global warming hot-spot at all. The predicted hot-spot is entirely absent from the observational record. This shows that atmosphere warming theory programmed into climate models are wrong.quot; [4] Contention 2: Earth is cooling  Here we can see the plotted Global Warming Hot Spot that was suppose to be there according to the IPPC, however weapos;ll see that theyapos;re wrong.   Why, it appears that this hotspot doesnapos;t even exist! [7]  Youapos;re probably asking yourself, why am I seeing this graph again? This is because the more CO2 we get the less warming there is. If we observe this graph we can see that the Warming has decreased with more CO2 that weapos;ve recieved. This shows that CO2 doesnapos;t have that much of an impact on the tempterature like the math that Iapos;ve proved it in my last contention. [5]   Now I will agree that Eastbrook isnapos;t good with predicting temperature change, but the IPCC is even worse, but whatever is causing the change it is highly unlikely that itapos;s man made. Contention 3: Artic and Sea Levels  THough my opponent likes to blow things out of perportion we can see that these sea levels rise and fall on their own. Itapos;s a natural cycle as I showed last round. The trend shows only a mere +/- 0.30 mm per year. quot;The Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory estimates the rate of sea level rise at 1.42 plus or minus 0.14 mm/year for the period 1954 to 2003. This is less than the estimate of 1.91 plus or minus 0.14 mm/year for the period 1902 to 1953, indicating a slowing of the rate.quot; [6] We can see that 2.8 inches per 50 years isnapos;t that much of an appocolyptic threat.  Here is a graph from NOAA which shows that the sea level rise is very small and that the IPCC is way off as well as many other Warming quot;expertsquot;. [8]  In the above graph we can see that despit Artic Ice slightly decreasing we can see that it follows the same patern throughout the year as the Ice melts in the summer and freezes in the winter. We can see that my opponentsapos; sea ice level predictions are incorrect. [9] Which if sea ice is decreasing then explain the great sea ice exspansion of Antartica in 2012 shown bellow. It had a total of 20,000 miles more ice than average.  Contention 4: Weather  The NOAA has shown that Tornados are less frequent and occur less and less. Now the irony behind this is that it comes out at the same time as my opponentapos;s sources which claims the exact opposite. [10] Also I do wish that my opponet reposts link number 7 as it is broken and I cannot access it, so for now I continue to extend across my NOAA Hurricane graphs from last round. Contention 5: Ocean Acidfication Here I Would like to report that we do not emmitt Cobalt2. (I know you meant CO2) If we do some basic Chemistry we can see that 1-6 on the pH scale is acid 7 is neutral and 8-14 is base. The Ocean on average is 8.2 which is a base. Now letapos;s add in the factor of the average coral reef needs CO2 and the average reef can varry from 9.2 to 7.6 throughout the day and night showing that there is no accidfication. This CO2 added envirnment has been seen to increase coral growth by 2 cm per year. We can also see that these areas very by 0.3 pH pending on the area. [11][12] 1. (http://cdiac.ornl.gov...) 2.

    <t>;Thank you, lannan13. Please note that the first few arguments are identical to that of my last global warming debate as my opponent could not finish the last one and has decided to redo this.==Contention 1: The correlation between increase in Carbon Dioxide and global temperature==Throughout the last 650,000 years, there have been seven cycles of glacial advances and retreats, where the carbon dioxide levels abruptly increased, then gradually decreased afterward. However, in 1950, Co2 levels were at a critical level and kept on rising. As of 2014, the global Co2 levels were at an all time high of nearly 400 parts per million [1]:2 has increased since the Industrial Revolution. (Source: [[LINKAs we can see above, in the last 650,000 years, the Co2 levels have never grown above 300 ppm, as opposed to now, where the Co2 levels are at 400 ppm. Obviously, this abrupt growth in Co2 levels are caused by human activity, such as mass production, the use of electricity, polluting, etc.I have provide a youtube video above to show the correlation between the high Co2 levels and global temperature [2]. When both are compared, this becomes irrefutable evidence that man-made global warming exists.In fact, as of 2013, the average global temperature was 14.6 degrees Celsius (58.3 degrees Fahrenheit), which is 0.8 degrees Celsius (1.4 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than when the year was 1880, and 0.6 degrees Celsius (1.1 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the mid-20th century baseline [3][4][5]: Already, on the first contention, we have seen major evidence affirming the resolution.==Contention 2: The cause and effect of the Greenhouse Effect and what makes it more powerful==The greenhouse effect on Planet Earth has been occurring for almost its whole life and is a natural phenomenon, since greenhouse gases such as Co2 have existed on Earth from its birth, thus heating the Earth to help sustain forms of life [6]:quot;To its credit, the greenhouse effect has been around long before humans began to burn fossil fuels, and it is a natural phenomenon in that makes life habitable for all living things.quot; [6]The greenhouse effect operates when the sunapos;s heat passes through Earthapos;s atmosphere, heats the Earthapos;s surface and is reflected back upward. Most of this heat is absorbed by the greenhouse gases like water vapor, Co2 and methane. Afterward, the heat is re-emited in all directions, thus starting the cycle again, continuously heating the Earth. Greenhouse gases literally act like a thermal blanket for Earth [7]:of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide – act as a thermal blanket for the Earth, absorbing heat and warming the surface to a life-supporting average of 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius).quot; /gt; quot;A layer of greenhouse gases – primarily water vapor, and including much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide – act as a thermal blanket for the Earth, absorbing heat and warming the surface to a life-supporting average of 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius).quot; [7]From this information, we can conclude that the more greenhouse gases are put into the atmosphere, the more heat from the sun is absorbed, thus creating a powerful greenhouse effect. Human actvity is causing this to happen.P1) The more greenhouse gases there are in the atmosphere, the more powerful the greenhouse effectP2) Human activity is emitting more greenhouse gases into the atmosphereC) Human activity is the cause of a more powerful greenhouse effect, and thus man-made global warming exists.To further prove this point, let us inspect Earthapos;s neighboring planets, Mars and Venus.Marsapos; atmosphere is quite thin, and itapos;s nearly completely made up of Co2. However, it is because of the low atmospheric pressure and lack of other greenhouse gases that the greenhouse effect is not at all strong and thus Mars has a frozen surface without any signs of organisms [7].quot;Not enough greenhouse effect: The planet Mars has a very thin atmosphere, nearly all carbon dioxide. Because of the low atmospheric pressure, and with little to no methane or water vapor to reinforce the weak greenhouse effect, Mars has a largely frozen surface that shows no evidence of life.quot; [7]Now, let us inspect Venus.Despite Venusapos; atmosphere also being almost entirely carbon dioxide, the amount of Co2 Venus contains is about 300 times as much as Marsapos; or Earthapos;s. This creates a HUGELY powerful greenhouse effect, causing a temperature so high that lead could not stay solid. [7]quot;Too much greenhouse effect: The atmosphere of Venus, like Mars, is nearly all carbon dioxide. But Venus has about 300 times as much carbon dioxide in its atmosphere as Earth and Mars do, producing a runaway greenhouse effect and a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead.quot; [7]Again this information is major evidence of the existence of man-made global warming.==Conclusion==I have put forward major evidence and arguments proving the existence of man-made global warming. I have also put out evidence that the greenhouse effect does indeed exist.Thus, the resolution is affirmed.[1] http://climate.nasa.gov......;[2] https://www.youtube.com......;[3] http://climate.nasa.gov......;[4] http://climate.nasa.gov......;[5] http://data.giss.nasa.gov......;[6] http://earthguide.ucsd.edu......;[7] http://climate.nasa.gov......;</t>

    <t>Got it. From this round I will refer to Carbon Dioxide as CO2.Also, my round 2 sites are incorrectly entered. Here they are in respective order:http://climate.nasa.gov...https://www.youtube.com...http://climate.nasa.gov...http://climate.nasa.gov...http://data.giss.nasa.gov...http://earthguide.ucsd.edu...http://climate.nasa.gov... ==Rebuttal 1:  CO2 and its effects==The statement that humans are not contributing to the emission of greenhouse gases is completely false. Many sites [1-3] point out that humans are, in fact, the most major cause of warming in modern days.quot;Natural changes alone can’t explain the temperature changes we’ve seen.quot; - Union of Concerned Scientists [2]quot;Scientists have closed the case: Human activity is causing the Earth to get hotter.quot; - Environmental Defense Fund [3]And, if we were to agree with my opponentapos;s logic, then his arguments are contradictory to his third graph - where he states that Carbon Dioxide is correlating with temperatures perfectly, which is true [4][5]: Keep in mind that both charts show increasing temperature and temperature increase rates, but short after the Industrial Revolution began, contrary to my opponentapos;s selective graphs where he tries to disprove warming by selecting a range of 10,000 years, when really the Industrial Revolution only started in the 18th century [6]. My opponentapos;s third graph, as proven, is contradicted by my opponentapos;s statements above. Let us look at his two halves of his chart combined [7]: If the warming effect of CO2 is minimal, then how would the temperature correlate with it so perfectly? And even then, in the years before, the temperature would drop almost instantly after it reached its peak, but the warming period we are in is actually holding itself up there, rather than just being pulled down. Also, we cannot use this graph anyway as the time scale is way too large to see our effects in recent years. Moreover, his charts could be misleading as he has not cited any links to substantiate his second, third and fourth charts. Let us look at his fourth chart.His fourth chart tells us that water vapor and other natural causes cover the vast majority of contributions to the greenhouse effect, whilst human emissions only cover about 0.28% of contributions. However, this is very misleading, because it does not count in ANY OTHER FACTORS. For example, we already know that humans have deforestated the vast majority of forests on Earth [8]:Wildfires, which already contribute to the greenhouse effect [9], are affecting the area of forests worldwide [8]:           Trends in wildlife area burned in wildfire in U.S.    quot;“Wildfire emissions can have remarkable impacts on radiative forcing,” says Liu.quot; - USDA [9] quot;Tropical deforestation contributes as much as 90% of the current net release of biotic carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This change may represent as much as 20% - 30% of the total carbon flux due to humans - i.e., rivaling the carbon release due to fossil fuel burning.quot; - Global Change [9]Humans, as shown bove, are acidifying the ocean and deforestating (cutting down trees from forests), which is labeled as one of the more major causes of the greenhouse effect on my opponentapos;s chart. As for my opponentapos;s logarithm argument, this is also contradicting the correlation of CO2 and temperatures because the logarithm would not be able to cause a perfect correlation. Thus this argument is null.==Rebuttal 2: The Earth is cooling==My opponent states that his hot spot argument was dropped, when in reality I had responded to this with two paragraphs of evidence. My opponent is straw-manning here. My opponent even goes on to state that I dropped his CO2 argument, to which I responded with even more text. That went unrefuted by my opponent.Also, the quot;Hockey Stickquot; graph is actually proven many times to be quite accurate (at least in the warming period) by studies of different sources, like corals, stalagmites, tree rings, boreholes and ice cores. All confirm that the 20th century saw the most dramatic increase in global temperatue in recent history.quot;Since the hockey stick paper in 1998, there have been a number of proxy studies analysing a variety of different sources including corals, stalagmites, tree rings, boreholes and ice cores. They all confirm the original hockey stick conclusion: the 20th century is the warmest in the last 1000 years and that warming was most dramatic after 1920.quot; - Skeptical Science [10]Note that my opponentapos;s next graph is a very selective one and that its time scale is literally over a ten-year period. Plus, the grap shows the temperature variations, which ends up being above zero. This graph is contradictory to my opponentapos;s arguments.Also, my opponentapos;s quote and evidence that global warming as stopped is also quite selective as it is over a period of 8 years. My opponent is blatantly biased as he only used selective time periods instead of an actually unbiased time period, where it focuses on where humans have been speculated to have started to contribute to global warming.==Rebuttal 3: Arctic Ice and Sea Levels==Again, my opponentapos;s graph here only shows a time period of 45 years. Let us look at a graph starting from 0 CE, and as we can see towards the end the sea level rises dramatically [11]:s://motherjones.com...; alt=quot;Different ways to measure sea level over timequot; /gt; As you can see the sea level has risen over 20 cm since the start of the Industrial Revolution and has been very consistent throughout this period.My opponent then goes on to reinstate his argument that Arctic Ice is increasing, which I had already refuted with my NASA evidence, which was collected in late 2014, while my opponent uses data from 2006 and 2013. Even then, my opponent only uses two photographs of the Arctic Ice, each from two single, separate days, which again is subjective because it doesnapos;t show anything over time, but rather it only shows separate days. Again disregard this piece of evidence. Also, even though I concede the Antarctic Ice expansion, I had proven Arctic Ice was losing ice more than twice as fast than the Antarctic Ice grew. Thus this point is null.==Rebuttal 4: Hurricanes and Tornadoes==My opponent drops my argument that tornadoes do not link to global warming.My opponent is misunderstanding my hurricane intensity argument. It has been shown that when sea levels rise (which I proved true) stronger hurricanes get stronger, but weaker hurricanes show little to no trend. [12]quot;But more significantly, Elsner found weaker hurricanes showed little to no trend while stronger hurricanes showed a greater upward trend. In other words, stronger hurricanes are getting stronger. This means that as sea temperatures continue to rise, the number of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes hitting land will inevitably increase.quot; - Skeptical Science [12]My opponent even states that I dropped his R2 graph, which I responded to throughout the debate. The link was only broken. My opponent keeps straw-manning that I drop his arguments when a lot of my arguments have been left unrefuted. I ask my opponent to stop.==Rebuttal 5: Ocean Acidification==My opponent is saying that since the ocean has not acidified to a certain point that can be deemed critical. However my opponent must notice that small parts of the ocean are acidifying to the point that organisms are dying and being replaced with anaerobic organisms, which produce methane, which further contributes to global warming. Parts of this are directly caused by normal everyday pollution, which an kill animals and bleach corals, which has been proven above to have alreday happened.==Dropped arguments== My opponent drops the following arguments/rebuttals:- That CO2 levels have been ising exponentially over the last few centuries- That CO2 levels 600,000,000 years ago are irrelevant since not even the dinosaurs had existed then- That my opponents graphs are very selective and biased- That the Arctic is losing ice more than twice as fast than the Antarctic is gaining ice- That tornadoes do not have a link to global warming- That ocean acidification, even if not at a critical level, is affecting the temperature of the surroundings.I would like to remind my opponent that he must not respond to these dropped arguments in the last round as I cannot respond to them. Any new rebuttals to these dropped arguments should be disregarded.==Conclusion==I have effectively refuted all my opponentapos;s arguments, countered my own, and also proven that my opponent has dropped some of my arguments.The resolution is affirmed.[1] http://planetsave.com...[2] http://www.ucsusa.org...[3] http://www.edf.org...[4] http://www.skepticalscience.com...[5] http://warmgloblog.blogspot.com...[6] https://www.google.com...[7] http://www.skepticalscience.com...[8] http://www.globalchange.umich.edu...[9] http://www.srs.fs.usda.gov...[10] http://www.skepticalscience.com...[11] http://www.motherjones.com...[12] http://www.skepticalscience.com...</t>

    <t>Letapos;s begin..   Case Defense   I-Cost   I would like to say that I am truly apologetic for the misunderstanding concerning cost however the con’s demands are very unfair and limiting. I will agree that it is abusive for me to change the cost and the distance in the plan during the second round but the change comes far from the middle of the debate; so what is the impact of my abuse on the round itself? Whatever it may be I would like to point out that it should not be that the con team gets to fabricate their own price, that is unfair and that is abusive. If the con should get to decide his own price then the debate is literally already over because he can fabricate a price as high as he wants, is that fair…remember that I Never said that the price listed was wrong, I simply showed that I couldn’t support the price because I don’t have the proper evidence I Do have evidence which supports a cost though, and I have presented that evidence. The con team cannot deny this. Con wants to label me a cheater and an abuser because I have been forced to alter the plan, yet he wishes to create a falsified price in order to make it impossible for me to win thus ironically being the abuser himself. This is the resolution to the problem which I will propose and like it or not this is simply the only reasonable option remaining in the round. I see that it is abusive to change things in the round. I have changed 2 things, the distance and showed proof for a different cost. Thus I will keep the distance at 49,515 miles of construction for a cost of 8.1 billion dollars. This does nothing but help con, it may not help him as much as letting him fabricate a price but it still definitely helps his case while hurting mine. To be honest I have no qualms about this price because it can still get paid off if 1 hurricane with the median cost strikes the US. This really only extends the payoff time to 4.5 years as well which is really not bad. Take it as my word, the plan will not be changed any longer. I would also specify that the plan will be paid for through normal means.    II-Cost II Here is exactly why your price is invalid, again I will reiterate. Con is literally claiming that because artificial reefs have the qualities of an artificial breakwater that they actually are artificial breakwaters. This is simply illogical and is analogous to claiming that a sponge, for instance, is the same as a straw because they both suck things up. It is completely irrational and should be invalidated as any sort of point.    III-States I dislike that con and pro are playing some sort of sematics/interpretation game but here is the fact on this. I clearly stated that the plan will take place on All Feasable Costal States, I then gave some Examples of a few costal states, If con misinterpreted the plan text then that is unfortunate but the way any rational person would understand it, is as I would in my opinion and thus I wont go into this very much.    IV-Trade Con has ignored my evidence. It is impossible to for a ship to get caught on any reefs I will build as they will be from 12-30 miles off of the coast line which is as deep as 400 meters deep. It would literally be impossible for any ship to get caught on our artificial reefs at this distance as I have proven. If con disagrees he cannot prove the contrary by citing cases where a ship has gotten caught on a Regular Reef that is not even between 12-30 miles off of the coast. Really con needs to find quoted evidence proving that artificial reefs which are never more than 10 feet tall would somehow block all trade in the US while in water that is at least 300 meters deep.         Case Offense   Aids/HIV   A.)  Staggering numbers of people have HIV and are dying from the epidemic World Health Organization [Since the beginning of the epidemic, almost 78 million people have been infected with the HIV virus and about 39 million people have died of HIV. Globally, 35.0 million [33.2–37.2 million] people were living with HIV at the end of 2013.]    B.)  As stated in first round, Coral reefs provide a plethora of cures to diseases. The government has literally found a protein derived from coral reefs that prevents the spread of HIV National, April 29, 2014, quot;Coral reefs provide potent new anti-HIV proteins,quot; EurekAlert!, http://www.eurekalert.org...# [Testing the proteins against laboratory strains of HIV, the researchers found that cnidarians were highly potent, blocking HIV at miniscule concentrations—one billionth of a gram. They worked by binding to the virus and preventing it from fusing with the CD4 membrane. “It’s always thrilling when you find a brand-new protein that nobody else has ever seen before,” senior investigator Barry O’Keefe, PhD, deputy chief of the Molecular Targets Laboratory at the National Cancer Institute’s Center for Cancer Research, said in a release. “And the fact that this protein appears to block HIV infection—and to do it in a completely new way—makes this truly exciting.”] Furthermore [Researchers will now look to produce larger amounts of the proteins for further testing. “Making more of it is a big key,” O’Keefe said. “You can’t strip the Earth of this coral trying to harvest this protein, so our focus now is on finding ways to produce more of it so we can proceed with preclinical testing.”] Now folks, logically, what might be the result of creating a utopia of coral reefs in the U.S.? Simply put, the preventative cure for HIV. The evidence above states that the only thing needed is More Coral Reefs, the plan provides and thus will significantly reduce the amount of HIV/AIDs in the world and US given more time to do research.      Fisheries I-Status quo of the fishing industry and environment A.)  Fisheries Doomed If every coral reef in the world was a strictly protected area, and if every fisherman was prevented from fishing, unlikely as these options are, coral reef fisheries could still not recover. Many or most reef habitats are already so badly degraded that they cannot regain the carrying capacity for economically valued species that they formerly had.    B.)  Fishing methods are unsustainable, industry wont change The richest countries like the European Union, the United States, Japan are the most damaging, and 90% of the top predatory fish are now gone (Myers and Worm, 2003)...the coral reef habitat and thereby the future fisheries are permanently destroyed    C.)   Situation is getting worse the degradation of marine ecosystems and fisheries can only be expected to worsen    D.)  The situation is getting worse II areas are too severely degraded to allow recovery of corals, fish, and invertebrates to former levels because the habitat quality is so badly degraded that reefs have lost most of their carrying capacity for these species. Even if every reef was strictly protected and all fishermen were eliminated today, the fisheries would still not be able to recover to former levels. There is no doubt that over-fishing has been disastrous almost everywhere (Pauly et al.,1998; 2000)    II-Significance/Harm of Reef Degradation A.)  impact on countries Over 100 countries could lose their major source of marine biodiversity, beach sand supplies, tourism, fisheries, and coastal protection in the next few years if current trends continue, with severe but incalculably high economic losses (Goreau and Hayes, this volume).      III-Solvency: what do we do now and what are the benefits?   A.)  Now is The Time to Start Saving Reefs The tools are now in our hands for saving coral reef and oyster reef ecosystems from extinction from over-harvesting, global warming, and pollution, protecting coastlines from global sea level rise, increasing fisheries, and saving beaches and tourism economies. There is of course a real cost, but the sooner large scale investments are made in marine ecosystem restoration the greater the benefits will be and the lower the expenditures needed. There is now no other alternative to effectively reverse global marine degradation that is accelerating out of control except to do nothing.    B.)  Mineral Accretion is now the only effective way to revive our reefs and fishing industry Large-scale habitat restoration of degraded areas is now the only hope for recovery of the coastal fisheries, biodiversity, sand supplies, and shore protection that only large healthy reefs can provide. Unless the vast wastelands of degraded reefs are restored, all tropical coastal countries will soon face crippling economic losses. Unfortunately, at this time there is no serious funding for large-scale coral reef restoration.    C.)   Healing Powers of Mineral Accretion In the Maldives Biorock [Mineral accretion] reefs have effectively absorbed wave energy that they have turned an eroding beach into a growing one (Goreau, Hilbertz, Hakeem and Hameed, 2000). In Indonesia dense schools of fish in Biorock [Mineral accretion] structures have caused fishermen to start building similar structures to increase catches (Goreau and Hilbertz, 2001). Settlement of larval corals can take place at exceptionally high densities, hundreds per square meter, under conditions where poor water quality has prevented all settlement on natural substrates (Goreau and Hilbertz, 1996). Larval and adult fishes are attracted to these structures at exceptional densities, quickly forming schools so dense that one cannot see across the structures.   D.)  The Value of Reefs While most benefits of coral reefs can not possibly be quantified in monetary terms, such as the value of biodiversity, biogeochemical cycling services, and esthetic beauty, three of them are amenable to direct economic valuation: fisheries, tourism, and shore protection   E.)   Monetary Estimate of the value of reefs When considered as earnings per kilometer of reefs, the values for fisheries and for tourism typically ranged from several thousand dollars to several million dollars per kilometer of reef per year   no space for a summary, but citations in comments section.

    <t>1. Pro has never claimed that this is policy debate   (From the Government agency rebuttal) 1.) The plan will be carried out through Normal Means, Just as Every Single Policy Debate Plan Is.   Policy: a high-level overall plan embracing the general goals and acceptable procedures especially of a governmental body http://www.merriam-webster.com...   Plan text: The USFG should increase construction of mineral accretion coral reefs in the US   Therefore, as the United States Federal Government is accomplishing this and it is a high level plan, this is a debate on policy making it policy debate. The pro stating that they never claimed to be doing a policy debate does not excuse the fact that the resolution implies it.   2. The ‘entire point’ of policy debate is NOT to evaluate a plan, but is to promote education and learning.   Policy debate is a form of debate competition in which teams of two advocate for and against a resolution that typically calls for policy change by the United States federal government.   http://en.wikipedia.org...   While the con generally frowns on the use of Wikipedia as a main source, the description is accurate and relies on multiple debate organizations for their definition. More importantly, it’s more evidence than the pro, who holds the burden of proof, has provided.     3.Con wishes to implement his own price, which I will later explain doesn’t make sense anyways, thus making the round literally impossible to win   The pro has not explicitly stated in any round how the con is fabricating prices. As the con made sure to use the evidence provided by the pro, in addition to simple mathematics, it’s impossible for the con to have fabricated a price that was not equal to the actual cost of the plan.   This destroys the educational value of the debate because there can be no education if there is no round in the first place. Not only this, but it wastes space in the debate reducing the amount we can argue that actually has educational value. The educational value is elicited by those viewing this debate. It will teach them to not amend their plan or otherwise change rules without stating them in their 1AC, thereby destroying the structure of policy debate. In order to maintain the future of education, infractions must be addressed so as to keep them from becoming the norm.     This also hurts the sportsmanship of the game and promotes tension between the players. This clearly also hurts educational value.   This tension is irrelevant if any is felt. As the point of the debate is to evaluate the Affirmative teams plan, the con is not obliged to sidestep possibly sensitive subjects to the pro in order to keep their emotions manageable. However, the con recognizes that antagonizing the pro, or con for that matter, is not acceptable and apologizes if it appears that that was the goal.   Thus, Con’s propositions are abuses which far outweigh any abuses which I have committed and the second price should stand. Con has disproved abuse by the Negative team, therefore the issues that were stated previously still stand against them.     Price   1. Artificial reefs are NOT artificial breakwaters just because they have a similar sounding definition.   Actually, that’s exactly how something falls in to a category. The con has provided evidence of a category and used the pros own evidence to prescribe the actual cost resulting from this. The pro has failed to provide evidence that artificial reefs are not a type of artificial breakwater, thereby refusing to provide clash which is an integral part of education in a debate.   2. Thus the price of artificial breakwaters is NOT the same as the price of artificial reefs   See Price-1 for analytics that disprove this statement.   3.I also have provided quoted evidence from a massive study which declares artificial reefs of the mineral accretion assortment only cost 50,000-100,000/ kilometer which equals about 75/meter, giving us a grand total of 8.1 billion dollars for the plan   The pro provided evidence on a possible cost of artificial reefs. However, as they never disproved that these man-made reefs were not a type of artificial breakwater, the con must assume the worst as the possibility of over 9 percent of the USFG budget being lost is still very real.   4.Thus because I have professional evidence and because Con is using completely flawed logic for his calculation, my answer is the one should remain in play   The con has used the pros own evidence and simple mathematics to determine the cost, unless the pro is claiming that their own evidence is actually flawed analytics. In that case, the pro argument is negated as they have then failed to provide any evidence of cost and con arguments still stand.     States 1. The plan literally states: “the plan will take place on all feasible coastal states” Again, the con reiterates that this is twisting the plan text by avoiding what is really said. The real plan text is as follows: The plan will take place on all feasible coastal states: (California, Louisiana, Texas, South Carolina, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, New Jersey, and Maine) are all up for consideration As the judges can see, the full sentence significantly changes the context. Instead of saying all feasible coastal states of the USA, it specifically defines the states up for consideration. This is an issue when there are specific states, defined earlier in the debate, that have been hit by hurricanes and are not protected. 2. The plan doesn’t Ever state: “only the listed states will be up for consideration” This is correct, the plan does not state this. However, the plan ends up doing what this sentence implies as proven in States-1.   3. This means that the con is using semantics and assumptions which aren’t based on what is literally in the plan text, while I am. The con disagrees that it is using semantics when the subject is whether or not the plan actually does what the pro claims it will do. Considering the plan is supposed to protect people endangered by hurricanes, the blatant dismissal of threatened states must be addressed.   4.Finally the plan also states that I affirm the right to clarify my case as necessary, meaning if there is a simply word confusion, like this, I can clarify what it really means.   Clarify: to make (something) easier to understand http://www.merriam-webster.com... The pro implies that this is difficult to understand, however the con is having no issue in reading the text. The dilemma is the fact that this plan is explicitly defining the states that can be evaluated. In fact, the line below it specifically excludes Alaska. 5.Thus my and the literally states interpretation must be the accepted version   The pro never provided a definition. Their interpretation is that the con is wrong which is not a counter definition nor a clarification.   6.Thus please strike out the states disadvantage   Using evidence from above, pro argument is effectively dropped, flow to con.   Government agency 1.The plan will be carried out through Normal Means, Just as Every Single Policy Debate Plan Is.   http://openevidence.debatecoaches.org...   The con recommends that the pro browse through the open evidence project. It has plenty of policy debates that have actual funding programs and agents of action. This means that the plan will be carried out in the normal way that congress would pass/fund/and operate any given plan. Congress funds and operates any given plan by finding a source for the money and an agent of action. As the Pro has never been able to define either, con argument stands.   2. Thus the agent of action and funding are all taken care of See Government agency-3   3. the agent of action is not critical to supporting the educational value of the debate   As pro never defines what is actually educational, the con will state that the agent of action is critical to supporting the educational value of this debate, thereby negating them as they are using analytics as well. 4. Thus it doesn’t matter in any case   This is an unreasonable jump in logic, suggesting that no entity in the USFG acting as an agent of action matters. The con will call this untopical and leave it at that as it provides no worth to debate this under the resolution.   5. There is no rule which mandates that an agent me named   The con will assume that the pro meant ‘an agent be named’. And this is true, no one has to execute the plan by your text, therefore no one will, therefore billions will be wasted on a plan that no one is executing.   6. Thus I have not broken any rules and no abuse has been done   The abuse lies in the claims that the con is fabricating claims in addition to complaints about the con not allowing amendments to the plan text at the whim of the pro. The con assumes that the pro is at least somewhat familiar with the basis of policy debate to respect the base structure of it and demands that it be given so as to allow for structured debate instead of letting emotional bias take effect.   Trade Pro failed to provide counter evidence. The plan also does not establish the distance that they claim the reefs will be at from shore.  Fisheries The fisheries evidence came from the pro, so the pro trying to discredit their own evidence is not showing a healthy and well made plan. The con has already provided the evidence and quotes needed to negate the pros arguments in the previous round, extend them and note that the first quote from con in the previous round still negates the pro arguments as they came from the pros own evidence. The shore protection, as stated in the previous round, is covered under the state protection disad.   Tourism Pro evidence claims that artificial coral reefs are made of the same material as a coral reef, calcium. Therefore the same dangers to biodiversity apply unless the pro had proven that these man-made reefs would be stronger.</t>

    <t>CASE DEFENSE  I. COST A.) Cost of the plan itselfCon has claimed the the price of the plan will be somewhere around 9% of the GDP using his personal calculations. Con has however pointed something of concern out. The plan I presented was premade by someone else and thus I have no idea how the calculations came about, this means I cannot support the plans stated cost however using evidence I found, which I know is correct, I came out with another answer. The number is much higher the one listed in the plan, yet Much Much smaller than the fabricated price that con created. My calculations resulted in a price of 7.2 billion dollars, I then cut the distance in the plan from 49,515 to just 30,000 miles leaving us with a price of 3.6 billion dollars, a price which I can still easily justify… But before I tell you how I got that answer let’s examine why con came out with the wrong answer. Christopher used his 2014 Department of Interior citation (I’ll refer to it as the DOI from now on) stating that the average cost of building an artificial breakwater is [19, 791 per 1 meter] he then multiplied this DOI estimate times the number of meters constructed in the plan. This gave him the answer of 9% of the GDP. The real cost of construction per meter is not 19,791 because the plan does not call for the construction of Artificial Breakwaters, it calls for the construction of Mineral Acceretion Artificial Reefs, two different things. The real cost is found in my first citation which is a study by the coral reef alliance using the results of at least 12 other credited studies: “each kilometer of shoreline can be protected for about 50,000 to 100,000 [using mineral accretion]. This is only around 0.3 to 0.6% of the cost of a conventional sea wall, which provides no tourism or fisheries benefits.” Here is the exact method I used to get my answer of 3.6 b: 75,000/1kilometer = 75,000/ 0.62 mile = 120,967.75/ 1 mile Now I can use a proportion to find the price of 30,000 miles of reef construction: 120,967.75/1mi  =  X/ 30,000mi    (cross multiply)    X= 3,629,032,500 or about 3.6 billion dollarsB.) Time the plan needs to pay itself offIm my evidence from Accuweather given above, the median cost of a hurricane is 9 billion dollars and the average is 1.8 billion (dont understand the differenc but thats what they said) this means that if one hurricane with the median price range strikes (9b), then the plan has paid for itself 2.5x over! even if a hurricane with the average cost strikes (1.8b) the plan is paid off by only 2 hurricanes. This sharply contrasts conapos;s evidence stating that the plan will take hundred of years. Keep in mind that the biggest hurricanes like Hurricane Katrina costes the US about 125 billion dollars in revenue.But how long will it take for those hurricanes to strike?Dina Spector, 8-29-2012, quot;When Will The Next Nightmare Hurricane Hit The US?,quot; Business Insider, http://www.businessinsider.com...;quot;In an average decade the mainland U.S. gets hit with about seven Category 1 hurricanes, four to five hurricanes that rank as Category 2 and about the same number that hit as Category 3 hurricanes, but just one Category 4 hurricane.quot;Thatapos;s 1.7 hurricanes per year meaning the plan will almost certainly be paid of in less than 2 and half years.II. Fails to Protect all states A.) Con has misinterprited the plan textCon has stated that I must exclude all states I didn’t list in the plan from having coral construction done on them however this is simply untrue. If I reference my plan text it clearly states that: “The plan will take place on all feasible costal states” that means that unless it is impossible or would result in the downfall of the plan, those states will be constructed on.III. Trade DisadvantageA.) False evidence Con predicates his entire argument on one ship that is currently stuck in okinawa, not only does this Not prove that ships will Always get stuck, it also doesnt neccisarily apply to Mineral Accretion Coral Reefs because they are different things. In order for this argument to remain con must prove that mineral accretion coral reefs will cause shipping accidents using credible sources. I will also use further reasoning to show that this argument holds no substance. This is a picture of the ship off of Okinawa, it is small however if you look you can see that it is nowhere close to 12 to 30 miles off of the coast as required by the plan.It is plainly impossible for a ship to get caught on something  200-300 meters deep which is the depth of the ocean between 12-30 miles off the coast.CASE OFFENSEFurther Explanation of the Plan A.) Mineral AccretionThe plan calls for a vast area to be converted into reefs using mineral accretion. In my own words here is mineral accretion: electricity runs through a piece of metal which rests in the ocean. Through the proccesses of chemistry the electricity in the metal pulls out certain elements and compound floating around in the water which harden on the metal, usually limestone. If you have ever seen white stuff around your fosset that is the stuff that hardens on it. As it turns out the electricity and the the limestone offer corrals the energy they need to constantly grow and feed. Mineral Accretion also creates superior resilience to the effect of global warming and increases growth rates of the coral dramatically, its like corals on steroids. Now here is the technical stuff:definition of MA (mineral accretion): Mineral accretion is a new method that uses low voltage direct current electricity to grow solid limestone rock structures in the sea and accelerate the growth of corals providing homes for reef fish and protecting the shoreline. The electrical current causes minerals that are naturally dissolved in seawater to precipitate and adhere to a metal structure.The result is a composite of limestone and brucite with mechanical strength similar to concrete. Derived from seawater, this material is similar to the composition of natural coral reefs and tropical sand beaches.  In the plan the government will use industrial grade aquatic wire mesh and adhere it to the ocean, then run a current through it (1.2 volts, a AA battery has 1.5 volts) which will begin the proccesses of mineral accretion. Mineral accretion begins in just hours and will be finished within a few months, corals will then start to attach themselves to the mesh and reproduce causing a flourishing environment to grow for miles on end, with 80% of corals now dead in the caribean it is easy to see why we need this in America.But what about global warming? wont it just kill off the rest of the reefs when we plant them? No. quot;Corals were grown at sites in Jamaica where all the corals in the nearby reef had been killed by algae overgrowth caused by high nutrients, and where no new coral settlement was taking place. These had coral growth rates up to three to five times the record rates for many species, and settlement of hundreds of corals per square meter (Goreau and Hilbertz, 1996).quot;Biorock is a technology which harnesses the same power of mineral accretion, they have used their technology in certain areas and seen amazing results:quot;Corals grown in the Maldives on Biorock structures had 50-80% survival from the severe high temperature bleaching events that killed 95-99% of the corals on surrounding reefs (Goreau, Hilbertz, Hakeem and Hameed, 2000). Survival of Biorock corals was from 16 to 50 times greater than surrounding habitats (Figure 1). A large population of corals was being grown in the same habitat using conventional cementing methods and being used as controls to compare growthquot;  B.) Previous ArgumentsPlease note the the opponent has conceeded the humanitarian benifits of the plan such as cures and further innovations for disease and the amount of lives we save by implimenting coral reefsSummary: We have deterined the cost of the plan to be 3.6 billion dollars which will repay itself within no more than 2 and a half years, furthermore we have discredited conapos;s second argument because he simply misinterprited the plan text. On Conapos;s final disadvantage he states that implementing MA reefs will halt all trade however he doesnt have substantial evidence to support this claim and I have shown that all MA reefs will be well below the depth of passing ships. After concluding this things I moved away from Defense contentions to Offense contentions where I supported the strength and full out solvency of the plan while also explaining some of its details furthermore the con has conceeded that implimenting MA reefs will lead to cures for a plethora of diseases while also saving thousands of lives from hurricane mortalility. I look forward to the next round and I now pass the gauntlet to Con to craft his responses...</t>

He then concludes in my solvency evidence that only mineral accretion coral reefs offer the solution to the problem which can help and revitalize the fishing industry and thus save millions of dollars   1.)    Even if this advantage is wrong, you have conceded the health advantages and the shoreline advantages are also still in play 2.)    Thus the plan should still happen given that the opponent’s argument is true, which it is not.        1.)    Yet again con has attempted to re-read the plan and ignore what is plainly clear but let me just use solvency evidence which cancels out con’s claim:     “Large-scale habitat restoration of degraded areas is now the only hope for recovery of the coastal fisheries, biodiversity, sand supplies, and shore protection that only large healthy reefs can provide. Unless the vast wastelands of degraded reefs are restored, all tropical coastal countries will soon face crippling economic losses. Unfortunately, at this time there is no serious funding for large-scale coral reef restoration”   “When considered as earnings per kilometer of reefs, the values for fisheries and for tourism typically ranged from several thousand dollars to several million dollars per kilometer of reef per year”   Thus please extend the fisheries argument     Tourism   1.)   Tourism is never mandated in the plan 2.)   Con must provide case specific evidence that tourism hurts Mineral Accretion Coral Reefs for it to be a real disadvantage  3.)   Con simply states that tourism can bring bad health but never states how bad of degradation this causes and thus there is not significance to his claim   Con has done literally nothing bad exaggerate, lie, and attempt to ruin the educational value of the round as far as I am concerned and it is shown clearly in his mannerism and clear disregard for the fairness of the round. I have effectively shown why con has been abusive, and why his claims are unfounded. He has yet to provide a solidly grounded argument and thus I can only see the round leaning my way right now. I pass the turn back to con for a hopefully educational round.</t>

    <t>The cons argument will flow as follows: Cost State protection Trade ___________ Case offense answers Hurts biodiversity   Cost The proapos;s claim that the demand by con to protect their case rather than amend it during a debate is invalid. As this is a policy debate, the entire point of this is to evaluate the Affirmative team plan to see if it is viable. These are not strict limitations by the con but rather a standard rule that is seen in policy debate. Were this something such as a Congressional debate, the pros actions of amendment would be perfectly fine; however, this is not the case. Pro then goes on to claim that the con is now fabricating prices. However, all the con did was replace the shortened amount of miles that the pro decided to use with the actual amount in the plan text. Therefore, the cons numbers is the only valid amount between the two sides. The pro came up with a new cost in this round, claiming that the final amount is 8.1 billion dollars, which still far exceeds their budget. To put this plainly, the USFG cannot create something that takes more resources than they give. The pros plan calls for a budget of 225 million dollars, the con has proven that the actual cost is significantly higher and pro, even when trying to cut the amount of land protected, still far exceeds their budget. Finally, addressing the breakwaters, pro has not proven that the cons definition is false. As the con has taken their own plan text and compared it to a definition, proving that these artificial reefs are technically breakwaters, con must assume the worst-case scenario and give the maximum cost estimate. State protection Pro refuses to answer the state protection as they claim that this is simply semantics. The con will reiterate that this is Policy debate. In this form of debate, we evaluate the pros plan, or policy. As their plan text explicitly defines the states to be evaluated, this plan is exposing states that the pros evidence shows are under threat from hurricanes. Trade Pro asked for proof that the ships would be running aground, the con will point to the Great Barrier Reef, a reef that has grown to be the largest of its kind in the world. These reefs obviously will present a danger to our shipping industry. As they grow to surround our nation, ships will hit them, causing massive amounts of environmental damage. http://www.abc.net.au... http://www.abc.net.au...   Hurts biodiversity The pro claims that this will help the industries of fishing, tourism and coastal protection. However, the con will prove that the first two are short term at best (the coastal protection part is covered in State protection). Starting with fishing, the pros evidence on fisheries proves that the fishing industry destroys biodiversity. areas are too severely degraded to allow recovery of corals, fish, and invertebrates to former levels because the habitat quality is so badly degraded that reefs have lost most of their carrying capacity for these species. Even if every reef was strictly protected and all fishermen were eliminated today, the fisheries would still not be able to recover to former levels. There is no doubt that over-fishing has been disastrous almost everywhere (Pauly et al.,1998; 2000) This alone invalidates their solvency. Over-fishing has destroyed coral reefs. No matter how many we build, unless over fishing is addressed, artificial coral reefs will have to be rebuilt, as the marine life that usually inhabits them is dead or dying. Moving on to tourism, the con will reference material in the evidence below. Tourism may provide a small economic boost, however this will be short lived. As tourism hurts reefs in addition to overfishing, it may become difficult to keep them coming back when the reefs are skeletons from all the damage done by humans. Recreational activities also have a huge impact. For example, careless boating, diving, snorkeling, and fishing have substantially damaged coral reefs in many parts of the world, through people touching reefs, stirring up sediment, and dropping anchors. [Sic] The plan fails to address the dangers of human interaction with these reefs, so one must assume that the same dangers will apply. This means an increase in many factors including, but not limited to, seafood consumption, disturbing animals such as whales and sharks, and pollution. Therefore, this is not an advantage at all and flows con.  http://wwf.panda.org...</t>

    <t>The cons arguments will flow as follows. AnalyticsCostState protectionTrade disadvantageAnalyticsThe fact that the plan was premed does not excuse a lack of familiarity with the subject by the affirmative. The pro, in this debate, is expected to provide a plan and defend it. They may not claim that they copy-pasted this and therefore should receive leniency.CostFirst off is that the con will not let the changing of costs stand. Insofar that the plan defines a specific amount of coastline to protect and the pro may not simply amend their plan in the middle of the debate. This destroys educational value and makes it flat out impossible for the con to win when the pro may patch holes at will.The con will also observe that these new claims from the affirmative very much exceed the 225 million dollars that the plan originally allocates to this endeavour. Using this in tandem with the first cost argument, this raises the cost of the affirmatives plan using their equation to 7,968,666,800; something that is significantly greater than what was allocated in the funding and even claimed in the previous response by the pro.Moving onwards, the plan calls for artificial breakwaters.  quot;Coral reefs serve as an effective first line of defense to incoming waves, storms and rising seas,quot; said Dr. Michael Beck, lead marine scientist of The Nature Conservancy and a co-author of the study[sic]This is directly from the plan, falling under the definition of a breakwater.  breakwater: a wall that is built out into the sea to protect a harbor or beach from the force of waves. http://www.merriam-webster.com... Therefore, as the DOI evidence does not explicitly limit the use of mineral accretion, the cons numbers of over 1 Trillion USD still stands. The pro tries to use Katrina as an example, claiming that over 100 billion dollars in damage is to be expected. From their evidence, the con recovered two lines that negate this.   -There were also engineering problems.

State protectionThe pro is twisting the plan text instead of defending it. The verbatim text is as follows: -The plan will take place on all feasible costal states: (California, Louisiana, Texas, South Caronlina, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, New Jersey, and Maine) are all up for considerationThis explicitly defines the states to be considered, con arguments still stand.Trade disadvantage The pro has provided no evidence stating that this is not a real risk. In fact, all the pro side has done on this subjectis claim that the con is presenting false evidence without providing counter evidence. As the pro has the BoP, it is their duty in this debate to prove the validity of their case.However, the con will present two more examples of ship groundings on coral reefs.http://response.restoration.noaa.gov...Summary The pro has failed to provide acceptable measures on cost, even changing their plan to come up with a cost that is well over their budget. In addition, Pro has not proven that the other states will be protected. Finally, Pro has not fulfilled their Burden of Proof to show that US naval trade is in no danger. As it stands, the United States of America stands to lose over a trillion dollars with billions more lost in trade.</t>

Instead of debating, the pro continually complained that the con was being abusive as the pro tried to amend their policy during a debate. What the pro claims was sluggish indifference, the con sees as reiterating facts that the pro either would not negate, drop or understand, particularly those in relation to the structure and general rules of a policy debate itself. As it stands, the con has proven that the plan may cost up to 9% of the US federal budget and thereapos;s no one to even execute this.      The con has also proven that this presents a massive threat to our trade due to a lack of specificity in the plan text and the explicit exclusion of threatened states from protection. As the pro did not adequately, and in some cases did not at all, disprove, negate or present impact calcs to prove that their case is truly needed, the con can see no other ballot than that of the Negative Team.</t>

In contrast only reefs made by mineral accretion can provide permanent, cost-effective protection capable of keeping pace with rising global sea levels.

    <t>The flow of the debate will be as follows: Inherencies with the plan Analytics DA – Cost DA – Fails to protect states DA – Blocks ships   Analytics The affirmative fails to provide an agent of action, merely claiming that they will substantially increase investment in the use of mineral accretion. In addition, they fail to say who will enforce the execution of this project and the source of this funding. Without these three critical parts, the plan cannot move forward as there is no assignment to any department in the United States Federal Government to begin work on this plan. DA – Cost The median cost for building artificial breakwaters is USD 19,791 per meter, compared to 1,290 per meter for coral reef restoration projects. U.S. Department of the Interior 5/13/2014 http://www.usgs.gov...... The affirmative is using faulty calculations according to their own evidence. The con will break down the actual cost of construction according to the Affirmative’s evidence. The first step is the conversion of the miles that the plan calls for to meters. This results in a calculation of 49,515 miles being equal to 79,686,668 meters. After that the con multiplied the converted number by the cost per meter to achieve a final number of 1,577,078,846,338 or One Trillion –five hundred and seventy seven Billion – seventy eight million – eight hundred and forty six thousand – three hundred and thirty eight dollars. This is exponentially higher than the affirmatives claim of a mere 225 million dollars.   http://www.usfederalbudget.us...... 2014 The usfederalbudget.us site provides a relatively simple breakdown of the US budget which is 17,704.4 billion dollars or 17.704 trillion dollars. The actual cost of this plan is roughly 9 percent of the entire federal budget. The Con requires that the Affirmative fulfill their burden of proof in showing that the government can take this absolutely staggering blow. The Affirmative is charged with providing the source of this money as this cannot be ignored. Furthermore, let’s compare this cost to the Average cost per hurricane provided by the Affirmative. It would take slightly over 175 hurricanes that do 9 billion dollars in damage a piece to justify the cost of this enormous project. Atlantic Hurricane Season 2014 Kristen Rodman – May 18, 2014 With roughly 10 named tropical storms, five hurricanes and two major hurricanes predicted for the Atlantic Basin this season, AccuWeather.comapos;s long-range forecasting team anticipates two storms, either tropical storms or hurricanes, to make landfall in the United States. http://www.accuweather.com...... http://www.nhc.noaa.gov...... With the 2014 year being so inactive and NOAA showing that there has been 60 hurricanes per 100 years, it will be over 200 years before this plan generates a net-profit. The Affirmative must justify this long term investment in the face of technological advances out dating their plan.   DA – Fails to protect states http://www.aoml.noaa.gov...... Mississippi, Alabama, Oregon, Washington, New York, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Delaware, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Hawaii. What do all of these states have in common? They’ve been hit by hurricanes and yet are not protected by the Affirmative plan. As the Affirmative failed to clarify the exclusion of these places, it must be assumed that they have been unintentionally left out and therefore will suffer the consequences of this ill written plan. DA – Blocks ships A U.S. Navy container ship remained stuck on a coral reef near Okinawa for a second day Friday.January 23, 2015 – Frances Burns http://www.upi.com......   Coral reefs block ship movement. Ships trying to cross them, as proven by my evidence, get grounded and are even damaged.   http://www.ers.usda.gov...... Agricultural exports in 2013 amounted to 320 billion dollars and supported over one million jobs. http://www.waterencyclopedia.com...... This proves that Ocean trade is important historically, presently and in to the future. This plan would destroy US trade which, in 2000, shipped 736 billion dollars in that single year. Compared to the cost of the plan and the long term investment required to get anything out if it, it’s apparent that the economically destructive artificial coral reefs blocking shipping cannot be justified. In summary, the face value cost of the plan is staggering. That’s not even including billions of dollars in lost trade as ships cannot make it to other countries, being pinned in by the new reefs. Lastly, the plan fails to protect all states that are actually hit by hurricanes, bringing in to question as to states with major population centers such as New York are not covered. This plan requires elaboration and revision in order to give it a chance of consideration.</t>

    <t>I thank my opponent for his arguments, and his speedy response. The framework was depicted thoroughly in the first round, so the framework for the second round will be skipped. I will attempt to address my oppositionapos;s short argument, for there are ten thousand characters. May I also point out my opponent has already conceded to a rise in temperature from 1979-1998. I will skip right to the debate.   ==Recent Land Temperatures==   I will start with a straightforward argument, one that is quite often set forward by the pro on this debate topic. To see if the global temperature really is rising, we must look at the big picture, not just data collected from the last ten years. The reason for this is because, as every intelligent scientist knows, the temperature on the Earth is quite unstable, and often affected by sunspots. When the solar activity ceases, periods known as quot;maunder minimumsquot; tend to occur. According to one Professor Lockwood, the sunapos;s activity is falling off at a pace not seen in 10,000 years [1]. This happened around 1995-2000, which would explain why the Earthapos;s temperature seems to be quot;cooling,quot; as my opponent argued.    In fact, Drew T. Shindell found that these minimums in solar activity can shave 0.3-0.4 degrees Celsius off of Earthapos;s overall temperature [2]. The study conducted by Shindell found that in the last Maunder Minimum (1600-1700, roughly,) temperatures were widely affected.   quot;Modeled global annual average surface temperatures were 0.34°C cooler in 1680 than in 1780 [2].quot;     [6] Since it has been established that the sudden quot;stoppagequot; of global warming can be explained due to sunspots and minimal activity, we can now look at the temperature over the last 50 to 100 years. This is roughly when greenhouse gases skyrocketed, which is believed to be the main cause of global warming. I would also like to state that the graph my opponent set forward was obviously sawed, and came from a non-trustworthy source [3]. My opponentapos;s graph showed two of the following things:   1) Temperature over a 15 year period   2) A slight (possible) temperature fall that can EASILY be accounted to the drop off in solar activity. Also, the graph itself shows the major temperature imbalance, with temperature imbalance reaching up to 1.10 degrees Fahrenheit during 2008, which is minor compared to the 1.30 degree imbalance in 1998.   Results from a much more trustworthy link, NASA, show that temperatures from 1880-2000 (before the drop-off in solar activity) steadily rose 0.8-1 degrees Celsius [4]. Not so coincidentally, methane and carbon dioxide have skyrocketed according to samples taken from both North and South Pole ice [4].   quot;Despite ups and downs from year to year, global average surface temperature is rising. By the beginning of the 21st century, Earth’s temperature was roughly 0.5 degrees Celsius above the long-term (1951–1980) average.quot; -Goddard Institute for Space Studies and NASA.  In this graph, we see a variety of different things. First, there is a high imbalance between temperatures. However, we can also observe that the Earthapos;s mean surface temperature has inclined, though not necessarily in a straight line. The data shown by this graph depicts that the temperature of the Earth is rising at a steeper rate over time, which coincides with the increased Co2 emissions over the past decades [5]. It has been shown that the globe is warming (insofar) on land. This satisfies one of the definitions of global warming, which is that the globe is warming on land. As of now, part of the resolution is negated. On to the second part, which will be a rise in oceanic temperatures. ==Oceanic Temperatures== My opponent shows an increase in the polar ice caps (which, as I remind the audience, comes from a non-trustworthy link,) but does not show the size or temperature of any other part of the ocean. It seems like the opponent is focusing on little things that seem to go against global warming, so I will try to look at the big picture. For now, there are graphs explaining the sudden increase in Arctic Ice, such as the following [7]:  As the graph shows above, there has been a general warming across most of the worldsapos; oceans, which coincides with the atmospheric temperature. In response to the increase in Arctic Ice, we can see there is an isolated spot of cooling, but it is not generally a statistically significant trend. However, the Southern Atlantic Ocean has seen a two degree to a four degree increase in temperature (surface-wise.)Once again, we must look at the big picture. The possible increase in Arctic Ice (from August 2012 to August 2013) could be due to limited sun energy, an anomaly in unstable temperatures, etc. However, much like surface temperatures, the ice/temperature is very rocky, but it is clearly on a downward trend [8]. In fact, the data shows that there is a 3.2% decrease in ice per decade. What con also fails to show is the thickness of the ice, for an increase of thin ice does not necessarily coincide with lowering temperatures.Despite a rise in ice over the past two years, the oceans are undoubtedly hotter and the ice is still quite low. In the same year (2013) as the NASA satellite image was taken, the following statement was concluded:quot;October ice volume was around 20,000 cubic kilometers (approximately 4,800 cubic miles), meaning that ice volume in October 2013 still ranks among the lowest of the past 30 years.quot; -National Snow and Ice Data Center. To sum this rebuttal/argument up, we can see there is a small, normal spike around 2012-2013, and then a continuous downward trend from thereafter. In response to the Kevin Trenberth e-mail that my opponent pointed out, I would like to show what the E-mail actually said and meant.quot;Global warming is still happening - our planet is still accumulating heat. But our observation systems arenapos;t able to comprehensively keep track of where all the energy is going. Consequently, we canapos;t definitively explain why surface temperatures have gone down in the last few years. Thatapos;s a travesty!quot; -Kevin Trenberth, ©2009.==Overview of Next Round==I will end this round here having satisfied the definition of quot;global warmingquot; and refuted my opponentapos;s arguments. Of course, all of my evidence is very far from being stated. This was just an outline of what my case will look like. In the next round, I will go into further details concerning the following:-Changes in Migration-Animal Behavior-Hottest years on record-Density of Arctic Ice-Co2 Emissions-Glacial RetractionIn conclusion, all my opponent did was falsely state an E-mail and use biased evidence from a non-trustworthy link. He has also conceded that there was a period of warming, and stated a temperature WITHOUT evidence. I ask my opponent link me to his NASA Remote Sensing Systems that says there was an 0.36 degree Fahrenheit climb, because my graphs (which are must trustworthy) state an entirely different story.I thank my opponent for his time, and return the table to him.

    <t>==Framework==Before anything, I would like to address the oppositionapos;s arguments. He has copied and pasted (literally) in both of his arguments. He has cited where he got the information from, but he has not made any arguments of his own. Furthermore, I have refuted everything he stated from his first link, which shows he is using biased and unprofessional links to copy information from. I ask that he make his OWN arguments instead of just asking me to refute cold information from a website.The con side has not even refuted or responded to any of my arguments. I remind the reader that these points remain dropped by the con until such time as he is bold enough to actually refute them. Insofar, he has dropped the following four major points, all of which are vital to the resolution:-Surface temperatures are heating up-Hiatus in global warming is due to limited sun-Ocean temperatures are heating up-Increase in Arctic ice can be easily explainedHe has also dropped many other more minor points, but the above are the ones that are worth bringing up. Without further ado, I will refute my opponentapos;s quot;argumentsquot; and discredit his source. Afterwhich, I will add more evidence to support that the globe is heating up. This should solidify the resolution to the point where I should be able to win the debate. Letapos;s begin.==Global Temperatures are being Adjusted==My opponent states that global temperatures are being adjusted to show a warming trend. However, even while looking over his source, no strong scientific evidence supports this empty claim. He states that adjustments in temperatures were made by Goddard and the Institute for Space Studies, without any evidence, data, or a study shown. Since this seems like a disagreement between data sources as to what the temperature really is, I have found a graph showing what disagreement in temperature quot;reallyquot; looks like [1]. As is shown, practically all of the major temperature recording studios agree on the temperature change. To state that each temperature station doctors their results in an almost unanimous faction without any evidence is clearly absurd, borderline insane. My opponentapos;s article states that NOAA and NASA doctor their results significantly. However, JMA and MOHC seem to correlate with the findings, as well as almost all other temperature recording studios. In a review of over 10.5 thousand articles on global warming in 2013, it was found that only two of the articles questioned human involvement, and none presented an alternative theory [2]. It seems essentially irrefutable that scientists agree on almost all aspects of global warming. There is clearly no scandal here, and the Earth is clearly warming. I challenge my opponent to show me a graph from a highly trusted source that shows the global temperature going down instead of going up. Until such time, this point is refuted. ==Arctic Ice==Once again, the thickness of Arctic ice is mainly what matters, not the quantity, hence the saying quot;quality is better than quantity.quot; Though Arctic ice could appear to be going up, the thickness and luster is on a downward trend not seen before [3]. The total volume of Arctic Sea ice was lowest between 2007 and 2008, as reported by Maslowski in 2010 (PDF.) People who argue that Arctic and Icelandic ice is going up are merely focusing on a thin, almost nonexistent, layer at the top. But what they fail to notice is that ice is going down at a significant rate.For good measure, I will post another graph explaining the lack of correlation regarding high temperatures and an increase in ice [4].It was found the increase in Antarctic Sea Ice was due to a number of factors, as argued by various sources:quot;One [factor] is the drop in ozone levels over Antarctica. The hole in the ozone layer above the South Pole has caused cooling in the stratosphere (Gillet 2003). This strengthens the cyclonic winds that circle the Antarctic continent (Thompson 2002). The wind pushes sea ice around, creating areas of open water known as polynyas. More polynyas lead to increased sea ice production (Turner 2009).quot;Henceforth, it is blatantly obvious that an increase in Arctic Sea ice does not necessarily correlate with lowering temperatures, for there are many things to take into account. However, it has been shown that volume of ice is coinciding with rising temperatures. To sum up, we can see the Arctic ice volume is lowering, sea temperatures are rising, sources can be trusted, and my opponentsapos; source shows no evidence of itsapos; preposterous claim. The resolution that Global Warming exists is, insofar, affirmed.==Animal Behavior==Even if, in some event, we could not trust the graphs, there is natural evidence to back up the fact that global warming exists and is happening. For example, animals are migrating, hibernating, and swimming earlier than usual. This is clearly visible through the behavior of the marmot. Their hibernation cycle is ending three weeks earlier due to rising temperatures [5][6]. In a study by Terry Root, published on journal, surprising results regarding animal behavior were found.quot;Out of the nearly 1,500 species examined, the researchers found that about 1,200 exhibited temperature-related changes consistent with what scientists would expect if they were being affected by global warming [7].quot;These changes have occurred in history, but no changes have been as rapid as the ones we are seeing today. In retrospect, the temperature change is the most rapid in history. It is clear as day that animal hibernation is being effected by rising temperatures due to global warming. Furthermore, there is a conspicuous change in the migration pattern of various birds and animals. These animals and birds are migrating further up north (where it is much colder) due to the rising temperatures across the globe [8].The migration of many animals, most notably the wild turkey, cannot be ignored in any stance. Since 1966, the turkey has migrated an additional 468 miles due northeast, all while the temperatures in the United States (avg. January) rose due to global warming. In addition to both hibernating and migrating, animals are nesting and hatching earlier (most specifically, birds.) This is due to warmer springs [9][10]. To solidify these claims of warming, we will look into the hottest years on record.==Hottest Years on Record==a. If global warming is happening, recent years should be the hottest on record.b. Recent years are the hottest on record.c. Global Warming is happening.This logic is backed up with findings from Climate Central [11.]Due to the fact that my opponent neglected to respond to any of my previous arguments, and copied and pasted information from a website, I will end my arguments for this round right here. I return the table to him and wish him luck.

    <t>today I was on my favorite news website... the Drudge Report, if you donapos;t know what that is it is an uncensored news website that tells the truth and inst being choked by the government. one of the headlines was quot;PAPER: apos;GLOBAL WARMINGapos; BIGGEST SCIENCE SCANDAL EVER... quot;. I read the article, it stated that quot;When future generations look back on the global-warming scare of the past 30 years, nothing will shock them more than the extent to which the official temperature records quot; on which the entire panic ultimately rested quot; were systematically quot;adjustedquot; to show the Earth as having warmed much more than the actual data justified.quot; Homewood checked a swathe of other South American weather stations around the original three. In each case he found the same suspicious one-way quot;adjustmentsquot;. First these were made by the US governmentquot;s Global Historical Climate Network. They were then amplified by two of the main official surface records, the Goddard Institute for Space Studies and the National Climate Data Center, which use the warming trends to estimate temperatures across the vast regions of the Earth where no measurements are taken. Yet these are the very records on which scientists and politicians rely for their belief in quot;global warmingquot;.Homewood has now turned his attention to the weather stations across much of the Arctic, between Canada (51 degrees W) and the heart of Siberia (87 degrees E). Again, in nearly every case, the same one-way adjustments have been made, to show warming up to 1 degree C or more higher than was indicated by the data that was actually recorded. This has surprised no one more than Traust Jonsson, who was long in charge of climate research for the Iceland met office (and with whom Homewood has been in touch). Jonsson was amazed to see how the new version completely quot;disappearsquot; Icelandquot;s quot;sea ice yearsquot; around 1970, when a period of extreme cooling almost devastated his countryquot;s economy. One of the first examples of these quot;adjustmentsquot; was exposed in 2007 by the statistician Steve McIntyre, when he discovered a paper published in 1987 by James Hansen, the scientist (later turned fanatical climate activist) who for many years ran Giss. Hansenquot;s original graph showed temperatures in the Arctic as having been much higher around 1940 than at any time since. But as Homewood reveals in his blog post, quot;Temperature adjustments transform Arctic historyquot;, Giss has turned this upside down. Arctic temperatures from that time have been lowered so much that that they are now dwarfed by those of the past 20 years.Homewoodquot;s interest in the Arctic is partly because the quot;vanishingquot; of its polar ice (and the polar bears) has become such a poster-child for those trying to persuade us that we are threatened by runaway warming. But he chose that particular stretch of the Arctic because it is where ice is affected by warmer water brought in by cyclical shifts in a major Atlantic current quot; this last peaked at just the time 75 years ago when Arctic ice retreated even further than it has done recently. The ice-melt is not caused by rising global temperatures at all. Of much more serious significance, however, is the way this wholesale manipulation of the official temperature record quot; for reasons GHCN and Giss have never plausibly explained quot; has become the real elephant in the room of the greatest and most costly scare the world has known. This really does begin to look like one of the greatest scientific scandals of all time. this proves my point by using factual evidence provided by this article.  sources: http://www.telegraph.co.uk...  http://www.drudgereport.com...</t>

    <t>my opponent seems to be getting mad for no reason... like a typical american citizen that believes everything the government tells them... How have we come to be told that global temperatures have suddenly taken a great leap upwards to their highest level in 1,000 years? In fact, it has been no greater than their upward leaps between 1860 and 1880, and 1910 and 1940, as part of that gradual natural warming since the world emerged from its centuries-long quot;Little Ice Agequot; around 200 years ago.This belief has rested entirely on five official data records. Three of these are based on measurements taken on the Earthquot;s surface, versions of which are then compiled by Giss, by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and by the University of East Angliaquot;s Climatic Research Unit working with the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction, part of the UK Met Office. The other two records are derived from measurements made by satellites, and then compiled by Remote Sensing Systems in California and the University of Alabama, Huntsville. One of the more provocative points arising from the debate over those claims that 2014 was quot;the hottest year evahquot; came from the Canadian academic Dr Timothy Ball when, in a recent post on WUWT, he used the evidence of ice-core data to argue that the Earthquot;s recent temperatures rank in the lowest 3 per cent of all those recorded since the end of the last ice age, 10,000 years ago. In reality, the implications of such distortions of the data go much further than just representing one of the most bizarre aberrations in the history of science. The fact that our politicians have fallen for all this scary chicanery has given Britain the most suicidally crazy energy policy (useless windmills and all) of any country in the world.  source: http://www.telegraph.co.uk...</t>

    <t>Global Warming is Happening and we will die if something is not done, NOW!  More CO2 will lead to hotter climate that causes sea/water level to rise and ice melts, which leads to worldwide sea levels increased 4-10 inches in the last century. Climate changes which cause extreme storms, tsunami, typhoons, flooding, land covered with water steer towards the damaging of plants and human population. In the end the earth is hotter and bluer where it is not capable of any life. The study of ice cores from Greenland from 1000 years back show that there was less CO2 production than today. Extreme heat and drought causing people to die or have heat strokes and lead to rise in sea level which caused flooding. This also concludes that last 20 years have been the warmest years.

    <t>Greetings. The arguments you are presenting are common among the left side of the political spectrum over the issue of Global Warming/Climate Change. The negation of this debate will now provide eight points as to why the public has been mislead over the complexities of this issue:  1. The 20th century warming of 1-1.4quot;F is within the +/- 5quot;F range of the past 3,000 years. A 2003 study by researchers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics shows temperatures from 1000-1100 AD (before fossil fuel use) that are comparable to those from 1900-1990.  2. Rising CO2 levels are a result of global warming, not a cause of it. As temperatures increase, CO2 is released from quot;carbon sinksquot; such as the oceans or the Arctic tundra. Measurements of ice core samples show that over the last four climactic cycles (past 240,000 years) periods of global warming preceded global increases in CO2.  3. Human releases of CO2 cannot cause climate change as any increases in CO2 are eventually balanced by nature. CO2 gets absorbed by oceans, forests, and other quot;carbon sinksquot; that increase their biological activity to absorb excess CO2 from the atmosphere. 50% of the CO2 released by the burning of fossil fuels and other human activities, has already been absorbed.  4. Global warming and cooling are caused by fluctuations in the sunapos;s heat (solar forcing), not by the minor greenhouse effect of human-produced gases such as CO2 and methane. Between 1900 and 2000 solar irradiance increased .19%. This increase correlates with the rise in surface temperatures in the US.  5. Due to the inherent unpredictability of climate systems it is impossible to accurately use models to determine future weather. Climate models have been unable to simulate major known features of past climate such as the ice ages or the very warm climates of the Miocene, Eocene, and Cretaceous periods. If models cannot replicate past climate changes they should not be trusted to predict future climate changes.  6. Rising temperatures are caused primarily by water vapor, the most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, not by CO2. Water vapor concentrations in the atmosphere are driven by natural storm systems and ocean currents. According to a Mar. 5, 2010 study by researchers at NOAA, water vapor in the stratosphere was responsible for increasing the rate of warming during the 1990s by 30%.  7. The increased hurricane activity over the past decade (1995-2005), including hurricane Katrina, is not the result of human-induced climate change; it is the result of cyclical tropical cyclone patterns, driven primarily by natural ocean currents, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationapos;s (NOAA) testimony in the US Senate on Sep. 20, 2005.  8. Deep ocean currents cause climate warming and cooling in long term cycles. The minor greenhouse effect of human produced CO2 pales in comparison. Global cooling from 1940 to the 1970s, and warming from the 1970s to 2008, coincided with fluctuations in ocean currents and cloud cover driven by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) - a naturally occurring rearrangement in atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns.</t>

    <t>Let it be known that the affirmation side in this debate failed to refute any of my eight critical points that I made during the first round of the debate:  But anyway, my opponent brings up data claiming the fact that the Earth is currently warmer than it was a BILLION years ago. Considering that in the last billion years, multicellular life began, multicellular life left the seas and came upon land, the dinosaurs lived and died, and we net through two ice ages, using that range for data does not get any point whatsoever across.  Humans have adapted and lived through about 500 centuries of varying climates and animals surrounding us. Global warming and cooling has occurred at periodic levels throughout the history of planet Earth. We adapted then, and this was far before the massive technological achievement that mankind has attained in recent history. When nature tries to hit us, we hit back harder.  My opponent also fails to provide any evidence of climate change affecting the ownership and operation of modern business and how exactly the warming of the globe will affect these corporate institutions. The opponent also cites an increase of tsunamis due to warming temperatures, but this is simply impossible, considering that a tsunami is formed by a geological event and not one of climatical origins.  I urge a negative vote in this debate.</t>

    <t>Global Warming has been highly exaggerated. If you understand climate you should realize there are much more aspects to our atmosphere than CO2 caused by humans . CO2 caused by humans make up less than 4 percent of the C02 in our atmosphere yet politicians believe that we are to blame and that we must try to save the planet through some sort of carbon tax which while magically make the climate change. The simple facts are that CO2 is a RESULT of temperature changes NOT a cause. The climate graphs prove this. There is a 100 year gap in some places between temperatures rises and then the proceeding CO2 rises. The facts are that the majority of CO2 comes from the ocean. When the ocean temperatures rise more CO2 comes off the ocean. Global warming alarmist simply donapos;t take into account the fact that natural causes have produced temperatures to be much higher than they were today and CO2 levels where radically higher thousands of years ago before humans had any impact on the planet. Im not saying the greenhouse effect doesn;t happen or that humans donapos;t have any effect on the climate, what im suggesting is that after a 16 year quot;pausequot; in temperature increases yet human CO2 has gone up greatly in the last decade leads me to believe there is much more to go into the climate change than humans driving SUV and the climate is much more complicated than politicians say it is. All Im saying is I believe this debate should continue because skeptics do have good points.</t>

    <t>Thank you Con for starting this debate. I hope to have an interesting and civil dialogue with you. Introduction At first I was unsure if I wanted to take part in this debate. This is because the word quot;betterquot; was not clearly defined. By better one could mean that an omnivore diet has tastier food, is more convenient, and for that reason it should be considered quot;better.quot; However, Iapos;m going to interpret the word better to mean that a vegan lifestyle is superior to an omnivore one for various reasons. With that said, let me begin.Definition of veganism according to the Vegan Society: Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose. [1]Veganism is Kinder Towards Animals This, I think, is pretty obvious. In order for animal products to be produced, animals must be exploited. In modern animal agriculture we confine animals for their entire lives and make them miserable. They are denied proper veterinary care, free space to move around and exercise, appropriate social interaction with members of their species, and anesthesia during the process of castration and other mutilations. Once these animals reach market weight, they are sent to a slaughterhouse where they are hung upside down and have their throat slit. In 2013, a USDA inspector at a chicken slaughterhouse pointed out that: quot;[Workers] are literally throwing the birds into the shackles, often breaking their legs as they do it... They are working so fast, they sometimes get just one leg in the shackles. When that happens, the chickens arenapos;t hanging right... They donapos;t get killed, and they go into the scald tank alive.quot; [2]In quot;Modern Meat: A Brutal Harvest,quot; a 2001 article from the Washington Post, a worker at a slaughterhouse for cattle describes the disturbing reality of insufficient stunning: quot;It takes 25 minutes to turn a live steer into steak at the modern slaughterhouse where Ramon Moreno works. For 20 years, his post was ‘second-legger,’ a job that entails cutting hocks off carcasses as they whirl past at a rate of 309 an hour.  quot;The cattle were supposed to be dead before they got to Moreno. But too often they weren’t.  quot;They blink. They make noises,’ he said softly. ‘The head moves, the eyes are wide and looking around.’  quot;Still Moreno would cut. On bad days, he says, dozens of animals reached his station clearly alive and conscious. Some would survive as far as the tail cutter, the belly ripper, the hide puller.  quot;They die,’ said Moreno, ‘piece by piece.’ [3]To help put what I have said into perspective, I will link a short documentary by Mercy For Animals that demonstrates some of the things I have been talking about: https://www.youtube.com...Viewing animals as commodities for us to use for our pleasure and convenience is inhumane and disrespectful. If we think itapos;s morally wrong to ignore the suffering of human beings, then we should also think itapos;s morally wrong to ignore the suffering of nonhuman animals that we use for food. Veganism is Better For The Environment Animal production is a major contributor to climate change. In November of 2006 the United Nations came out with a report called quot; Livestockapos;s Long Shadowquot; where they explained that animal production was a bigger contributor to climate change than all of the Earthapos;s cars, trucks, buses, airplanes, and trains combined. The ICPP, which is an intergovernmental panel on climate change, has also said:quot;Please eat less meat -- meat is a very carbon intensive commodity... this is something that the IPCC was afraid to say earlier, but now we have said it.quot; [4] According to a study in the UK, dropping meat, dairy and eggs from your diet saves 50% more carbon emissions than driving a Prius. This study showed that an average 2,000 kcal high-meat diet has 2.5 times as many greenhouse gas emissions as an average vegan diet. [5] The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has also said that raising animals for food--including land used for grazing and land used to grow feed crops for farmed animals--now uses a staggering 30% of the Earthapos;s land mass. According to Greenpeace, nearly 80% of land deforested in the Amazon is now used as cattle pasture. [6] Veganism is A Superior Alternative To Fighting World Hunger In the U.S. we feed more than 70% of grain and soybeans to animals, [7] and in doing so we waste most of the food value of the grains that weapos;re feeding them. If all the grain currently fed to livestock in the United States were consumed directly by people, the number of people who could be fed would be nearly 800 million. [8] Depending on the species, the animals may return to us somewhere between 1/10th and 1/3rd of the food value of the grains and soybeans that we put into them. So we are just wasting huge amounts of food in order to produce the large amount of animal products. It would be better and more practical if we fed our grains and soybeans to people, instead of feeding them to billions of land animals. One acre of land can yield 30,000 pounds of carrots, 40,000 pounds of potatoes or 50,000 pounds of tomatoes. However, one acre of land can yield only 250 pounds of meat, which means that a meat, dairy and egg diet is an unsuccessful way to combat world hunger, and that a vegan diet is a superior alternative. This is why Food For Life Global, the worldapos;s largest feed the hungry organization, only serves plant based food. As well as Everybody Gets Fed, Earth Save and Plenty. A Well Planned Vegan Diet is Healthy According to the American Dietetic Association, Americaapos;s largest organization of health care professions:  quot;appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.quot; [9]Conclusion If we take animal welfare, the environment and world hunger into account, and ask ourselves which lifestyle is most beneficial, it seems like a vegan lifestyle is the better choice. In this paper I have provided various reasons for thinking that, and so I believe we are committed to the idea that veganism is superior. The resolution is upheld.Sources in comments</t>

    <t>Thank you Con for your opening statements.Introduction Firstly, I will begin by responding to my opponentapos;s arguments for why a meat diet is better. Secondly, I will defend my original arguments for why veganism is better than a meat eating lifestyle.  Nature Here Con argues that humans are meant to eat meat because we have molars and K-9 teeth. This is more of a statement of fact rather than an argument for why a meat lifestyle is better than a vegan one. I really donapos;t even have to respond to it for that reason. However, I will do so anyways. Yes, humans can eat meat but that doesnapos;t mean that we ought to. I could go next door and eat my neighborapos;s newborn. His baby is, after all, made of meat like animals. However, I think we would all agree that just because I CAN do that doesnapos;t mean that I should.  Food Chain Here Con argues that eating animals is morally permissible because animals in the wilderness eat other animals. This too, is not an argument for why a meat diet is better than a vegan one. However, I will respond to it anyway. Yes, animals in the wild eat other animals, but this is more of a statement of fact rather than an argument. It seems like youapos;re saying that because animals do that, it must be morally permissible for humans to do so as well. This is seriously problematic, because if we start to derive our moral values from what other animals do, then many things can no longer be consider immoral. Rape, infanticide, aggressive fights, ect. are all things that occur in the animal kingdom. Do we really want to say that because other animals do these things that we ourselves should be allowed to do them as well? I think not. Nutrition Here Con argues that meat is superior to plants when it comes to getting protein. He didnapos;t exactly explain how itapos;s superior. So for now, I will dismiss his claim. Taste Here Con argues that meat is one of the tastiest parts of the meal. This, I think, is kind of subjective. There are many people who do not like the taste of meat, and who prefer other foods. Con mistakenly thinks that all vegans eat is vegetables. This is untrue, because pretty much every food can be made vegan. Even things like meat. Whole grains, beans, nuts, seeds, pasta, pizza, lentils, tofu, tempeh, seitan, ect. are just a few of the many foods out there for people abstaining from animal products.  The Individual or Society?Con says that my arguments are simply stating that a vegan society is better, and that it is not addressing the individual person. And therefore my arguments are not even relevant to the debate. The individual and society distinction was not made clear in the rules of the debate. It was NOT, quot;A Vegan lifestyle is better than a meat-eating one for the individual,quot; or quot;A Vegan lifestyle is better than a meat-eating one for society.quot; The debate topic was simply, quot;A Vegan lifestyle is better than a meat-eating one.quot; I think Con is trying to conveniently make this distinction in the middle of the debate to make it easier for himself. However, even if I were to grant this distinction, veganism can still be shown to be better. While itapos;s true that one person switching to a vegan diet isnapos;t going to stop the meat industry, it does save nearly 200 animals per year [1] from the miserable existence on a modern farm. As I pointed out earlier, according to a study in the UK, dropping animal products from your diet saves 50% more carbon emissions than driving a Prius. So even if we ignore the society part of it, and instead look at it from the individualapos;s perspective, veganism is still better. Veganism is Kinder Towards Animals Here Con argues that the animals we raise on farms are meant to be food. This is again, more of a statement of fact rather than an argument. Of course those animals are there to be killed for our food. Thatapos;s why we continue to breed them on a massive scale. However, whatapos;s the moral justification for us doing this to animals? I donapos;t see it. This statement made by Con could have also been used by a white slave owner in the 18th century. To demonstrate this, let change the word animals with Africans, and the phrase quot;to be foodquot; with quot;to pick cotton.quot; Observe:  quot;The Africans we have on plantations are meant to pick cotton, would you all rather go back to picking your own cotton?quot;I believe Alice Walker said it best with her quote:quot;The animals of the world exist for their own reasons. They were not made for humans any more than black people were made for white, or women created for men.quot; [2]Con says that itapos;s more mean to not buy animal flesh at the store, because by doing that the animal has died for nothing. This line of reasoning is baffling. The animal whose flesh is being sold has already died for nothing, given that we donapos;t even need to eat meat. By purchasing that flesh you are not doing the animals a favor. All youapos;re doing is contributing to the continued existence, prosperity, and slaughter of more animals. Veganism is Better For The Environment I already explained how vegans individually do help the environment by saving more carbon emissions, and not producing huge amounts of greenhouse gas emissions like meat eaters.  Conclusion Con has literally given no reasons to believe that an omnivore lifestyle is better than a vegan one. I, on the other hand, have given various reasons for thinking that a vegan lifestyle is best.  Sources: http://www.peta.org...https://www.goodreads.com...</t>

    <t>My apologies, I guess quot;betterquot; was too vague. Thanks for accepting the debate in-spite of that. I hope this will be a very fun debate.  Opening ================ I believe that an omnivore life-style is more beneficial than a vegan life-style. I hear many people say this, and I have a very strong belief on the Con side. I will provide arguments and rebut my opponentapos;s to further support my point.  Arguments ================ 1. Nature A lot of people say that eating animals is wrong and immoral, this is incorrect. Herbivores have molars to easily chew vegetables, and carnivores have K-9 teeth (the pointy teeth, for those of you who donapos;t know what that means) to help tear meat. Us humans, have them both. Why? Because we were meant to eat meat AND vegetables, not one or the other. This is nothing new to Earth and other animals share this trait, which leads me to my next argument.  2. Food Chain Again, people say that eating animals is immoral and wrong. I have an example of where itapos;s perfectly ok; the wilderness. Animals eat other animals all the time. In fact, some animals only eat OTHER animals (carnivores). So humans eating meat is nothing new to nature.  3. Nutrition While a vegan diet has a slightly better nutritional value, a meat eating easily gives you protein. Yes, there are ways to get protein in vegan diets, but meat is superior when it comes to protein. If you have any desire to exercise and work out, you know that you can recover faster if you consume protein afterwards. Protein builds muscle. Athletes also eat meat, sure, itapos;s controlled, but they still eat it. According to source [1] quot;A 100 gram portion (3.5 ounces) of raw ground beef contains large amounts of Vitamin B12, B3 (Niacin), B6, Iron, Zinc, Selenium and plenty of other vitamins and minerals,quot; obviously meat has a lot of nutritional value  4. Taste Letapos;s face it, meat is one of the tastiest part of the meal. Vegetables and fruits canapos;t really live up to meatapos;s taste. Wouldnapos;t people like to eat something that taste good? If you had to only eat vegetables, meal time wouldnapos;t be so good. Yes, there are some tricks to make vegetables taste better, but meat tops it all.  Rebuttals ================== Oh geez, Iapos;m going to sound so mean.  First of all, I would like to say one argument here. Most of Proapos;s arguments are arguing that a vegan SOCIETY is better. We are talking about the individual here. If one were to switch to a vegan diet it wouldnapos;t stop the meat industry. All the arguments about quot;Veganism is better for the environmentquot; or quot;Veganism is a Superior Alternative To Fighting World Hungerquot; are not relevant to this debate. One person isnapos;t going to stop the meat industry, so most of Proapos;s arguments are useless.  1. Veganism is kinder toward animals Okay, here we go. This sounds a bit mean, but itapos;s true. The animals we raise in farms or in plantations are meant to be food, would you all rather of back to hunting for food? We may not have a successful hunt and we may starve. Sure, if you eat vegan you arenapos;t eating the animals, but the animals is still on the shelf, useless. Isnapos;t it meaner if you just leave the sacrifice of an animal un-used? That means that the animal died for nothing, and the meat will just rot and become useless. Sounds mean.  2. Veganism is better for the environment Again, one person isnapos;t going to miraculously stop the meat industry. There will still be animals production. This argument doesnapos;t explains why itapos;s better for the individual to switch to a vegan diet.  3. Veganism is a superior alternative to fight world hunger There will still be livestock... One person isnapos;t going to change it.  4. A well planned vegan diet is healthy While yes, vegetables are healthy for you. However, if you arenapos;t a vegan you still eat vegetables and fruits, so you will get the nutrients you need from those foods. The only difference is that you have good tasting food and a great source of protein with an omnivore diet.  Sources ============ [1]: http://authoritynutrition.com...</t>

    <t>Thank you Con for presenting your arguments.    Con stated in the rules at the beginning of the debate that I will not be allowed to argue in round 5. For that reason, this will be my last round to post arguments for this debate.NatureCon says that if Iapos;m going to claim that eating animals is morally wrong, I need to provide a reason for why that is the case. In my first round of arguments of this debate, I said that itapos;s morally wrong because it involves animal exploitation. These animals are forced to live a life full of pain and suffering. Not only that, but they are also killed prematurely at the slaughterhouse. Now, one may ask, why is it wrong to inflict pain on sentient animals? I would say itapos;s wrong because pain is a sensation whose absence is intrinsically desired. Why is it wrong to kill sentient animals prematurely? Itapos;s wrong because it deprives them of a valuable future it could have, and thwarts the current desires they have like desires for food, sex, and being outside on a warm day. Con says that our ancestors ate meat for a long time, and that they needed to do so for survival. This is more of a statement of fact rather than an argument. However, it seems like Con is saying that because our ancestors ate meat for a long time, it is therefore morally justified. This line of argument is a fallacy, because itapos;s an appeal to tradition. In the U.S., owning African Americans as slaves used to be a tradition. But does that mean owning other human beings was justified? No, clearly not. In the same way, just because we have been eating animals for a long time does not mean that we should continue to do so. Nutrition Itapos;s true that meat provides vitamin B12, and that this nutrient is of extreme importance. However, vegans can obtain vitamin B12 from taking a supplement or eating foods fortified with it. So meat eaters donapos;t actually have an advantage here when it comes to B12. Con may object that if vegans have to supplement or eat foods fortified with this nutrient, this means that a vegan diet is unnatural. However, this argument would be an appeal to nature fallacy. Just because something is natural or unnatural does not mean itapos;s good or bad. Many of the things we do nowadays could be considered unnatural. Driving a car, flying in an airplane, using a cell phone, debating others online, ect. could all be considered unnatural. As registered dietitians Jack Norris and Virginia Messina point out in their book quot;Vegan for Life.quot;quot;Todayapos;s commercial plant foods and meat are different from the foods available in prehistoric times. We eat hybrids of plants and we feed foods to animals that they would not normally eat. Additionally, the U.S. food supply is routinely fortified with a host of vitamins and minerals. Even those people who strive to eat a more quot;naturalquot; diet as adults have normally benefited from fortified foods as children. It is quite unlikely that anyone is eating a natural diet in todayapos;s world.quot; [1] Iapos;m still not convinced that meat is a superior source of protein. Meat has cholesterol, saturated fat, and no fiber in it. However, a cup of cooked lentils has 18 grams of protein, fiber, no cholesterol, and is under 1 gram of fat. [2]Veganism is Kinder Towards Animals Con says we were designed to be omnivores since the beginning. Itapos;s true that human beings are omnivores, however, we are not obligate omnivores. We can be healthy without eating animal products. They are not necessary for good nutrition. Veganism is Better For The Environment Con asked me how animals produce more greenhouse gases than all of transport. To put it simply, the worldapos;s 1.5 billion cows and billions of other grazing animals emit dozens of polluting gases, including lots of methane. [3] Methane is produced by farting and belching cows. So, since we raise huge amounts of animals for food each year, and each of them produces polluting gases, itapos;s not hard to see how they would produce more than transport. In sum, a lot of animals, a lot of polluting gases, equals serious problems for the environment. Conclusion Overall,  I think I have shown how a vegan lifestyle is better than a meat eating one. Itapos;s better for the animals, will provide more food for hungry people, and is better for the environment. This would all be true even from the perspective of the individual instead of society. Finally, thank you Con for a enjoyable debate. Sources: Vegan for Lifehttp://www.nizkor.org...http://www.hsph.harvard.edu...http://animals.howstuffworks.com...</t>

    <t>Thanks for the debate, Pro.  Rebuttals ============ 1. Nature It seems that Pro is linking animals to slaves. This is not a good comparison, and this is why. Animals are treated with RESPECT. Crazy, right? After all, the big manufacturers treat the animals poorly. Ask any farmer who is not part of a big manufacturer and they would say they care for their animals, even though they are to be killed anyway. Even some farmers who are part of large manufacturers love their animals, and they think they shouldnapos;t be treated like so, some even quit because of this. Animals are still LOVED, they are not viewed as quot;mere commoditiesquot;. Second, food. Did we need slaves to survive? No, it was just a way to be lazy. Animals can be FOOD, it isnapos;t bad for you and it certainly has nutritional value. We ate it for SURVIVAL, slaves were used just for making things easier, and they werenapos;t treated with respect. Yes, there could be improvements to the current system, but how does this benefit the individual? It doesnapos;t, it doesnapos;t.  2. Nutrition Pro forgets one key aspect. Pro keeps arguing how eating vegetables and fruits is healthy, we need to remember that having a omnivore diet means eating vegetables and fruits too. As I explained in round 4, you get all the nutritional value of fruits and vegetables, and get all the benefits from eating meat as well. Why trouble yourself into trying to find a source of protein and all the nutritional things in meat in a vegan diet, if you could just change to a healthier omnivore diet( (eating more fruits and vegetables)?  3. Veganisim is Better for the environment Do we need electronics to survive? Do we really need online debate sites? Do we need big cities or schools to survive? No, they arenapos;t necessary, but they are EXTREMELY beneficial. We could live without all these things, itapos;s possible, but itapos;s better if we do have them. Same thing goes with meat, we donapos;t need meat, but it is extremely beneficial. Remember, you will still be eating vegetables and fruits, and you will benefit from meat too.  4. Veganisim is better for the environment So, if we let ALL of them free, will that help? At least in farms they get food, and their waste gets cleaned up. Imagine how bad it would be if we let them free. A lot of natural resources would be depleted, there would be overcrowding due to the mass amount of animals., and there will be a lot of gases being thrown into the atmosphere. In fact, there might be even MORE, because thereapos;s no one to clean it up. All in all, it would be more disastrous for everyone if we just let all of them free.  Conclusion ============= I stand firmly on the position that an omnivore diet is better than a vegan one for the individual. You get all the nutrition from fruits and vegetables, AND you get the added bonus from the meat (Not to mention having one of the tastiest parts of the meal). It is just better and more nutritious (thatapos;s vague, but thatapos;s all I can think of). I believe I have successfully countered my opponents arguments, and that my arguments stay standing.  Thank you for the amazing debate Pro. Thanks to all the voters who vote, and I hope you vote Con.</t>

    <t>Thank you for extending and understanding, Pro  Rebuttals ============= 1. Defending my clarification When I created this debate, I intended for the debate to focus on the individual. I thought the topic title would speak for itself. Lifestyle relates to an individualapos;s choices in life, or how the state of their life is. What I believe Pro is trying to say is that a vegan community is better than a meat-eating one, which is not what the title is. Therefore, I still stand by my clarification, as it was originally intended for this debate.  2. Nature This was originally intended to be a rebuttal. If it is truly morally wrong to eat animals, give me a reason why it is. I strongly believe that it is NOT morally wrong to eat animals. Our ancestors have been doing it for a long time, and it was necessary for human SURVIVAL back then, and it still is. Pro has not given a reason WHY itapos;s morally wrong to eat animals.  3. Food Chain This was originally intended to be a rebuttal. Have we had any problems eating animals? Any health problems? We have been eating meat for a long time. Tell me Pro, why is it wrong to eat animals? After all, we have been doing it for a long time.  4. Nutrition I will give some reasons why an omnivore diet is nutritional. First, we need to see that an omnivore diet STILL INCLUDES VEGETABLES AND FRUITS. We arenapos;t totally dismissing vegetables and fruits in an omnivore diet, that would be a carnivore. So omnivores will get the nutrition from vegetables and fruits, along with the nutrition of meat. Here are some reasons why meat provides nutritional value. [1] Meat provides vitamin B12, which is a vital vitamin. Studies show that 92% of vegans are severely lacking in this vital nutrients. Pro asks how meat is superior in protein. Meat contains a lot of amino acids, which builds muscle. Studies show that people with omnivore diets have more muscle then vegans. It also increases your bone density at an old age and reduces risk of fractures. WITH the added value form vegetables and fruit, we can see that the omnivore diet is better.  5. Veganisim is kinder toward animals Unlike humans, those are animals. We didnapos;t eat the slaves, we didnapos;t even need them for survival. Our ancestors didnapos;t used slaves, itapos;s something government gave birth to. All of the animals (including us) have basically a couple basic needs. Find FOOD and drink, Sleep, Reproduce. Itapos;s just that us humans are a lot more advanced than animals, but we all still share the same basic needs. All animals need to find food, meat or not, and we were designed to be omnivores since the beginning.  6. Veganisim is Better For The Environment. How does it produce more greenhouse gases than airplanes, automobiles, and trains combined? Pro claims that it produces more greenhouse gases, but how? How does it? Pro does not explain this argument well. All that pasture land would probably be used as farms, which as we know, without proper farming techniques, the land will be derived from itapos;s nutrients and it will unable to yield crop, which results in more forest land being cut down for farms.

    <t>Enviomentalism is a religion not climate change. We do not have to live eternally to see the effects of global warming. Of course we can not predict the outcome of the global warming other than we know it has happened frequently in the past. The climate has a cycle where ice age is the last stage (or the first depending on how you put it). Global warming follows the average temperature of the earth. This does not mean that all over the world it will get hotter. Global warming does not only result in warmer temperatures, but also in more violent storms, more violent earthquakes etc. We can prove climate change by just looking at pictures of glaciers now and 50 years ago (http://nsidc.org...).</t>

When we see a weather forecast, you are right that they are not 100% right, but there is a good reason for that. When you have to forecast the weather, you look at the different pressures in the different areas and thereby predicting e.g. a storms movement a behaviour.

    <t>Sorry for late delivery of this argument: I flew to New York to visit family during Christmas.  To correct my opponents reasoning, quot;humansapos; advanced thinking does not benefit the common good.quot; Whether humansapos; ability to think clearly and rationally is objectively great, there is no quot;common goodquot; when it comes to inter-species contact. If you have ever watched the PBS program quot;Naturequot;, you know that it is usually a zero-sum game when it comes to survival. Our skills are good for US and that is what matters. My opponent also said, quot;the Earth will crumble to global warming in a couple decadesquot;, which is completely null and void because global warming is a natural phenomenon that has been occurring since the end of the last ice age 14,000 years ago. I will not debate whether global warming is a real threat (or as real as eco-freaks make it out to be), nor if it is humansapos; fault- that is not the purpose of this debate (however, for the record, human beings are innocent in the climate change theory). My opponent then went further, quot;we single handedly destroyed billions of years of progress to produce life forms as they are todayquot;. Now, the term quot;progressquot; was used very, very loosely here. Progress as in quot;the evolution and random turn of events that resulted in the current state of thingsquot;? If that is what you mean, then what quot;wequot; have done is merely played our part in evolution- the weak are trampled and the strong go on to victory. It may seem wrong to justify it like that but be REALISTIC, human beings are a species like all others that is fighting against all odds for survival, we just happened to be WINNING, sorry about that.  Environmentalists and the irrationalists like them enjoy weighing the benefit of one INDIVIDUAL thing against the burden of the entire COLLECTIVE thing (as in, quot;is the iPhone 6 really better than the commonwealth of everything?quot;). This can get annoying to rational people, so allow me to turn the tables. Is the entire production of everything that supports BILLIONS of people all over the world that has lasted throughout human history and has benefited countless people just like your self better than preserving a certain sub-species of cheetahs?  Also, my opponent said that quot;in a couple million years, weapos;ve destroyed this planetquot; as a rebuttal to my statement that quot;we own this planetquot;. I was speaking metaphorically, as in our immense power over the planet, and my opponent took this literally and came up with an even DUMBER statement: quot;weapos;ve destroyed the planetquot;. Really? Weapos;ve destroyed it? Because when I look around, I see people shopping at supermarkets and living in heated, lighted homes and working with easy tasks instead of hunting for buffalo. I see barren land (objectively, of course) being transformed into neighborhoods that help families and individuals live lives that the kings of 500 years ago (before mass pollution) could never dream of.  Then my opponent said something so hypocritical, and really gave his debate away: quot;Many humans do live on the brink of starvation, fighting predators to survive another dayquot;. My opponent advocates environmentalism, which supports only those who live in such a way; you outlined a global tragedy that can only be solved by human beings who do NOT support environmentalism. When mining and manufacturing companies move into impoverished villages, they pay off the landowners and villagers and often build houses worth much more in order to give the villagers a place to live. Environmentalists constantly try to stop this with lawsuits. By your logic, all people should live like that.  You said that humans invented war. In a strong sense of the word, yes, you are correct. Yet, does this not stem from a purpose? Ideas. People have ideas, sometimes political or religious. These ideas have gotten us very far, indeed. Sometimes, however, people have conflicting ideas and one of them wants to force his ideas on the other. This results in a war. You have proven yourself wrong, by admitting that humans are the only species that have ideas to fight about.  Most bad things that have been done by humans (such as genocide) have been done by irrationalists (like yourself). Collectivism, communism, subjectivism, environmentalism, nationalism, racism, are all things that cause wars and devalue man. All of these things fall under the category of irrationalism, they are forms of philosophy that the Nazis follow.  The bad deeds of a few should not reflect poorly on the good done by everyone else. However, you are a collectivist and believe that humans, plants, animals, sand, and communists are all the same in terms of rights. There is no debating here.</t>

    <t>I would first like to thank my opponent for bringing up this debate. This is a very interesting topic.  First off I will refute my opponentapos;s points and then present my own.  My opponent has said that Earth has thrown so much at the human race and we have survived. Well, obviously, tons of other species have too. Humans have been on Earth a fraction of the time so many other species have. He also said that we have the power of rational thinking and advancement. But the question here is: Are the humanapos;s advancements actually good to the common good? No, actually, if you look at the facts a lot of them arenapos;t. The human race may only have another couple decades or so until the Earth crumbles to global warming. [1] Is it good that we single handedly DESTROYED billions of years of progress to produce life forms as they are today? Is the iPhone 6 really better than the commonwealth of everything on Earth? My opponent was even arrogant enough to say that we own this planet. Like I said earlier, weapos;ve only been around a couple million years and using that time, weapos;ve destroyed this planet. He said that it doesnapos;t matter that dolphins have higher thinking skills because they havenapos;t been able to build houses. News flash: Dolphins are underwater. They donapos;t actually need to build houses. He finally said that quot;we do not live on the brink of starvation, fighting predators to survive just another day.quot; Well, look at the news, my friend. Many humans do. quot;We invent, capitalize, work and trade as much as we can.quot; Many other species are actually very advanced. Take the komodo dragon. They hunt their prey in such an advanced way, they have an animal lying around to munch on for months. They chase after it for a little bit, bite it, and then simply wait. Their saliva contains more than 50 different types of bacteria. [2] You do NOT want to get that stuff into your bloodstream. After so little, they come home with a massive hunk of meat that, like I said earlier, covers their food needs for months.  Now I would like to present my arguments:  1-Humans donapos;t know when to stop: Like I said earlier, humans have pretty much screwed everything up. Even though humans created new stuff we DONapos;T KNOW WHEN TO STOP! All these other species have survived and thrived for twice or three times the time we have. Yet, they havenapos;t destroyed the Earth in every possible way. Additionally, we didnapos;t even realize what was going on until the 1970s. [3]  2-Humans are the most death-obsessed race: True, life is not all butterflies and rainbows. But humans have taken this to the next level. We have definitely invented one thing: war. Have you ever heard of a war between two groups of animals? Of course not. Thatapos;s because they are not as obsessed with death and destruction as the human race. In fact, no animal has ever killed another animal of its own species for reasons other than cannibalism on purpose. Additionally, no other species constructs such elaborate ways to create mass genocide. I did mention the advanced tactics of the Komodo dragon earlier, but does this compare to the myriad of work done on creating nuclear missiles, or mastering the idea of radioactivity so that we can use it to destroy a city?

    <t>My opponent started off by refuting my point that humansapos; advanced thinking does not benefit the common good. However, this argument still stands. According to him, if we are doing good for the short term life of our country, we are doing good for the world. This is the kind of thinking that humans use that HAS destroyed the world. If he will quot;not debate whether global warming is a real threat,quot; then I will first put in a last reason to prove climate change is a real issue, and then provide another example. Global warming may have been going on since the dawn of time, but (I am not going to provide a source for this one, if you oppose it then you need to be educated,) we have been greatly helping this along through the mass releases of carbon in every little activity that we do. Take my next example, extinction. Here we have yet another example of the quot;Great Expansionquot; of the human race. According to my opponent we are winning in the fight for survival, but to defend my point that we are the creators of war, (which my opponent supports, as I will later prove,) humans have taken this quot;fightquot; way too far. Do other species kill other tons of their own species to prove an idea? No! His refutation to this point was very weak. Its only purpose was to advocate war. He implied evolution was not progress, but completely missed the point. He asked if quot;the entire production of everything that supports BILLIONS of people all over the world that has lasted throughout human history and has benefited countless people just like your self better than preserving a certain sub-species of cheetahs?quot; but we can have a common ground here. Mass production of things we donapos;t need stands in the way of preservation, but we donapos;t have to become animals to help them. Do we need the iPhone 6, or the countless things a needless as it? No. But ignoring other beings because they are not vital to our own survival is different. You feel compassion for a dying animal on the side of the road, but not a broken phone. Then he went on to rant and call me a genocidal Nazi communist. He said that quot;most bad things that have been done by humans have been done by irrationalists.quot; Well, yes, but he only proved me right here. The human race has so many problems and so do other species. We are equal. True, not everything is equal, but a criminal is not better than a cat, is it? A cat may not have ever done anything bad, but a criminal sure has. Thatapos;s why heapos;s a criminal. The cat is better than the criminal.  I will go out of this round providing some extra reasons to vote for my side. First, humans are the only mammal incapable of making their own vitamin C, which actually caused Ebola in Africa. Ebola circled around animals such as monkeys in Africa for a long time without harming them, but a human got it and started this whole Ebola epidemic. Finally, humans are animals too. We belong to the Animalia Kingdom.  I have indisputably won this debate.</t>

    <t>Clarification: This debate is on the basis of whether or not humans are better than animals in respect to development and utilization of the environment, i.e. the mastering of life.  Humans are a species that has adapted to their environment very well in the last 100,000 years. This means that as much as nature has thrown at us during ice ages, floods, famine, disease, heat, cold, and all other kinds of disasters, humans have come out on top every time. We have evolved to be much more intelligent in respect to language, conceptual thinking, perceptual thinking, insight, and mathematics. Rational thinking is strictly human, all other animals have varying levels of instinct and lower levels of perception. Even gorillas, whose brain patterns and development is close to humans, have not been able to construct most anything. Gorillas have not linked their logical side to their instinctual side, thus any similarity to humans is unpractical.  All other animals are even lower in development and utilization of the environment than humans. Both objectively and subjectively, humans own this planet. The term quot;bestquot; can be defined by the most utilized, practical talents among the creatures of the animal kingdom. For example, it doesnapos;t matter in the slightest that dolphins are able to communicate well, because, in this moment in time they have failed to construct walls, housing, tools, or any other useful piece. This is why quot;man-madequot; is a term used for pretty much anything that is quot;madequot; by a living organism. Of course, ants, termites, and bees are close to humans in their social skills and developmental skills and thus could be said to be closer to humans than apes. However, our immense size (relative to smart insects) enables us to construct irrigation systems, mining and drilling operations, controlled fire, and most importantly, agriculture. These examples of utilization of the environment are absolutely impossible for creatures of insect size. Thus, the most important things in human life are strictly human.  The breaking free of quot;needquot; is an achievement of humanity. As humans, we do not live on the brink of starvation, fighting predators to survive just another day. We are more profoundly adapt to our environment than other animals. With such ancient inventions as knives, wheels, clothing, fire, farming, and buildings, we are able to set aside the limited time in the day for quot;playquot;. However, as smart beings, we use this extra time to reinvest in our welfare. We invent, capitalize, work, and trade as much as we can. With higher and higher returns in the standard of living, human beings have lifted from the mud and are the sole creature to have reached the stars.</t>

    <t>David Graber, an environmentalist at the National Parks Dept. once said, quot;Until human beings can rejoin nature, we can only hope for the right virus to come along..quot;. That is a little unnerving, however it is the basic consensus of the leaders of the environmental movement. My opponent implies that humans are not apart of nature, only a force against it. This means that you and I, if he is right, must be a plague upon the earth, and that we must be wiped out.  I know for sure that my opponent will next ride over that statement, saying that it is quot;foolishquot; and quot;absurdquot;. All environmentalists do. However, I ask you this: if my opponent considers building a farm a form of net destruction (as he stated), he must consider trees and quot;the millions of different life forms inside themquot; vastly more important than human beings like you and me.  This kind of thinking- that humans are equal to all life forms- engenders questions of the limits of quot;rightsquot;. In other words, does the ebola virus have the same right to exist as a human being? Obviously, common sense would dictate not. But, if you follow my opponentapos;s reason to itapos;s logical conclusion, a human has no right to murder a virus! This kind of nonsense is what happens if you take environmentalism too far; but honestly, name something in history that wasnapos;t taken too far. This line of thinking is evil, it implies that we are not more evolved than the lower animals, ad thus have no right to act as a dominant species.  My opponent keeps bringing up guns, murder, genocide, and war. Obviously, he is preoccupied with the bad parts of human life (as if the possession of reason has proved to be a net loss). If you consider how he points to the evils done by a few men, and blames them on the entire species, you can tell he has no chance of being correct in his argument. He skipped over my point that quot;the iPhone 6 is not a main source of pollutionquot;, clearly to avoid questioning our need for energy and food and shelter and paper and all other things we use everyday. If my opponent questioned our need for those most essential things, he would most definitely lose this lose this debate.

    <t>My opponent clearly doesnapos;t understand what the term quot;destroyedquot; refers to when he uses it. In the context quot;humans have destroyed the worldquot; he overlooks that in this situation there is a beneficiary. Therefore, it depends on the perspective. If I cut down 100 trees in order to build a farm that feeds a small town, is it destruction? This is the question that my opponent cannot ask.  When I said that I will not debate global warming, I meant right here, right now. In a separate debate, I would debate that. I do not quot;supportquot; war, but I (unlike my opponent) understand that it is the bad side of something inherently good, ideas. My opponent also keeps bringing up the iPhone 6, as if that is a major source of environmental pollution. Maybe you should ask, quot;do we need electricity?quot; not quot;do we need the iPhone 6?quot;. I realize that humans ARE apart of the animal kingdom, this debateapos;s topic (as I specified) is whether humans are the BEST in the animal kingdom.  Obviously, my opponent sees human beings as the sole source of win-lose environmental change; this would mean that other species do not run each other quot;out of businessquot;.

    <t>My opponent started with a quote from an environmentalist basically saying that humans have to be wiped out. This is a very extreme measure of what I am trying to say. My opponent has earlier said, quot;the bad deeds of a few should not reflect poorly on the good done by everyone else,quot; which proves my point and makes the quote entirely null and void. He said I quot;must consider trees and quot;the millions of different life forms inside themquot; vastly more important than human beings like you and me,quot; but he is merely and desperately trying to incriminate me. Millions, if not billions of organisms, in my opponentapos;s thinking are nothing compared to, in the scenario he described, at most 100 people. This is the sort of idea that sparks one of humansapos;s creations: genocide. Then he began going very extremely into this ideal, but viruses such as Ebola are not actually organisms, and therefore cannot feel. quot;Murderingquot; Ebola would have the same effect on Ebola as kicking a rock would on the rock. Can the rock feel? No, and neither can viruses and the other examples my opponent was implying. Then he went on to call me evil. He, all throughout this debate, has been attacking me personally, calling me a evil genocidal Nazi communist. This only proves he has realized that I have already won this debate, and is just angry with me. I am, in his opinion, quot;preoccupied with the bad parts of human life.quot; Well, as I have proven, most of the quot;advancesquot; of the human race have resulted in problems for the last couple hundred years. I didnapos;t skip over his point that quot;the iPhone 6 is not a main source of pollution,quot; I proved it was wrong. I have been using the iPhone 6 as an EXAMPLE, not the sole reason against humanity. In the above round, I talk more about this, so I did respond to his point. quot;Mass production of things we donapos;t need stands in the way of preservation, but we donapos;t have to become animals to help them. Do we need the iPhone 6, or the countless things a needless as it? No. But ignoring other beings because they are not vital to our own survival is different. You feel compassion for a dying animal on the side of the road, but not a broken phone,quot; to quote myself. In the final debate, I will provide again my two main arguments used in the first round:  1-Humans donapos;t know when to stop: My opponent has mainly focused on this argument, but still has not proven it wrong. As you will see if you scroll through this page, humans have, yes, destroyed the Earth. My opponent quot;refuses to debate global warming,quot; but thatapos;s OK, because there are so many other examples Iapos;ve shown throughout this debate: extinction, deforestation, and so on.  2-Humans are the most death-obsessed race: My opponent mentioned this once to partially agree with it. He used a weak refutation that war was about ideas, but there are other ways to prove an idea, and if you can kill more people than the other guy, that doesnapos;t mean youapos;re right. No other species has killed another of its own species purposefully for reasons other than cannibalism.  Now, a couple more reasons I have provided throughout: Humans are the only mammal incapable of making their own vitamin C, the cat vs. criminal example (a criminal is not better than a cat, is it? A cat may not have ever done anything bad, but a criminal sure has. Thatapos;s why heapos;s a criminal. The cat is better than the criminal), and weighing on scope (more animals than humans).  My opponent has failed to refute any of my points while I have effectively refuted all of his. I have obviously and indisputably won this debate.</t>

    <t>The sun drives of climate change The main driver of modern climate is solar activity. The energy output of the sun, called the irradiance. has been nearly constant in modern times, so thatapos;s not the cause. It is primarily the magnetic field of the sun which drives climate, and to a lesser extent the ultraviolet component of the irradiance. The magnet component varies dramatically. Norwegian scientists in the 1990apos;s discovered that the single measure of solar activity that best predicts climate is the length of the previous solar cycle. “The most readily apparent cycle in solar activity is the cycle in sunspot activity. These solar cycles average eleven years in length, and they have ranged in length from nine years to beyond eighteen years.“ [1] The length of the solar predicts climate change as shown in the graph [2] below:The increase in CO2 is very close to exponential, so as Pro noted, AGW theory predicts a straight line temperature rise. The graph shows clearly that is not what has happened. Climate has been behaving according to solar activity. “A paper published [in 2012] in the Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physicsfinds that up to 72% of the temperature increase over the last 150 years can be explained by the length of solar cycles,” [3] The length of the solar cycle does not perfectly represent the sun effects, so itapos;s likely that a more precise model would produce a more precise result.  Cosmic rays affect cloud cover  The physical theory that explains the correlation is summarized by Archibald: There are two main ways that changing solar activity affects terrestrial climate. Both have their origin in the strength of the Sun’s magnetic field. In the first route, a lower magnetic field strength results in less sunspot activity, which in turn mean less solar wind, which allows more galactic cosmic rays to get to Earth’s orbit. The neutron shower from galactic cosmic rays causes more cloud formation, which in turn reflects more sunlight back into space, making the Earth colder. … In the second route, the lower magnetic field strength results in a lower temperature of the Sun’s chromosphere, which in turn produces less ultraviolet light. That decreases the production of lower stratospheric ozone, and that decrease causes a negative North Atlantic Oscillation (a fluctuation in sea-level atmospheric pressure), making the Northern Hemisphere colder. This second route makes winters longer and colder without necessarily reducing peak summer temperatures. [4] If solar magnetic activity really changes cloud cover, the incident radiance on the earth should vary with the sunapos;s magnetic activity. That has been observed just as the solar theory predicts. [5] Solar activity is measured historically by the formation of beryllium 10, which accumulates in sediments to provide a history of solar activity. “The Modern Warm Period from 1900 to 2008 is associated with a large decline in Be10 in ice cores, indicating a sustained higher level of solar activity in the twentieth century. There is also very close correlation between ice-rafted stone debris in the North Atlantic and Be10 levels over the last 10,000 years—another demonstration that solar activity controls climate.” [6] The correlation continues through to the present day. Solar activity predicts the 17+ year halt in global warming as the cycle has reached a flat peak and is starting downward. The pause in global warming is illustrated in this graph: [7]:The AGW computer models include irradiance, which is essentially constant, but the models take no account at all of the solar magnetic effects that correlate tightly with climate. AGW theorists now admit that the CO2 models cannot be tweaked to explain the pause. They are now proposing a variety of new theories to patch the failed old theory. [8] One theory is that for some reason all the warming is going into the deep oceans. Another theory is that atmospheric aerosols (i.e., soot) is reducing the size of rain drops causing clouds to be whiter and reflect more energy. There are other theories. The problem is that if there is any uncalculated factor that completely wipes out CO2 effects, that admits CO2 does not dominate climate. If uncalculated factors can be as large or larger than the CO2 effect, that admits that previous warming might have been the result of unknown factors as well. The premise of the AGW theory was that because all the other factors affecting climate were known, CO2 must have caused the warming from 1983 to 1996.  Historically, solar activity drives climate with CO2 rising after there is warmingAl Gore famously showed two graphs, one of temperature over time and one of CO2 over time. The shapes of the curves were similar, showing a high correlation. Mr. Gore never overlaid the graphs. Had he done so, it would have been apparent that CO2 levels were following the warming rather by hundreds of years rather than leading it. As the oceans warm, they can dissolve less CO2, which is then released into the atmosphere. The CO2 rise is in response to the solar magnetic effects that changed cloud cover to cause the basic climate change.Over long periods of earthapos;s history, there is no relationship between CO2 and climate.[8]Consensus does not determine sciencePro has the burden of proving that human activity has dominated climate. My burden is only to show that the anthropogenic theory is unproved. A scientific theory is wrong if it fails to explain or predict, and anthropogenic theory has clearly failed. Iapos;m not obligated to prove an alternative theory, but I nonetheless shown that solar magnetic activity explains and predicts climate much better than CO2 theory. Since solar magnetic activity has dominated climate, anthropogenic causes cannot be dominant. AGW theorists admit that factors not in their computer models have been so large as to completely cancel greenhouse gas effects. for the past 17+ years.Pro stresses that it is not just that a consensus exists, but that the consensus is based on data. (Actually, the only real data is a general increase in temperature which solar theory better explains, and the rest is computer models that did not predict the hiatus.) But every scientific consensus has been supported by data that scientists at the time thought conclusive. A wrong consensus means that the data was incorrect or that it was incorrectly interpreted. The once near-unanimous consensus that the earth was the center of the universe was based upon the indisputable observation that the sky appears to rotate around the earth. The theory was found wrong only by more careful observations starting with the inconsistent behavior of the paths of planets in the sky. In the 1960s, the scientific consensus favored the Steady State Theory over the Big Bang Theory. The Big Bang Theory predicted the presence of microwave background radiation, so when the background radiation was discovered, the consensus changed rapidly. Not long ago, the learned scientific consensus was that homosexuality was a form of mental illness. Psychologists thought they had the data to prove it, but they were wrong; it is genetic. Modern scientists continue to make errors reflected in wrong consensus. A very strong scientific consensus has until the past few years supported the theory that in the human diet, saturated fat causes high serum cholesterol levels which in turn causes heart disease. It turns out the original theory was based upon falsified data. The landmark peer that quot;provedquot; the theory deliberately excluded data that falsified the theory. A couple of other bogus papers supported the theory, including one in which cholesterol was injected into vegetarian rabbits, who then quite predictably died. Studies over the past fifty years that attempted to confirm the theory instead disproved it. [9, 10] The originator of the cholesterol theory believed it, and he did a great job of selling the theory so it quickly reached consensus.. Many papers giving the “wrong” results were not allowed to be published, or the authors declined to submit them for fear of ruining their reputation. Some scientists published after they retired so that career retribution could not be inflicted. I recite the cholesterol consensus error because itapos;s very close to the way anthropogenic global warming theory has achieved consensus. Early enthusiastic advocates sold the theory as the only possible explanation of the rapid rise of temperatures from 1983 to 1996. According to that data, not only was CO2 the cause, but climate sensitivity much have been very large, perhaps five or even ten. Now Proapos;s claim is that it is at least 0.7. If it is that low, then global warming is not a crisis. itapos;s hardly worth noting. The bogus 97% consensus comes from surveying only journals that refuse to publish dissent. The Climategate scandal showed how eager AGW are to suppress dissent.quot;In a November 15, 2005, email Mann expresses his satisfaction that Geophysical Research Letters is now firmly under the control of the climate change alarmists but laments that other publications still publish research by skeptics: “The Geophysical Research Letters leak may have been plugged up now with new editorial leadership there, but these guys always have Climate Research and Energy and Environment, and will go there if necessary.” [9]Very few papers scientific papers say anything about global warming as whole. For example, there are about 200 papers that show that the Medieval Warm Period and similar climate change existed worldwide, and that refute the bogus Hockey Stick argument for AGW. But the papers would not be counted as being in opposition to AGW. Besides, they are in the wrong journals. Virtually all the papers on solar theory -- there are hundreds -- are in specialist journals, not the surveyed climate journals. ------------------------------------------Per the terms of of the debate, Iapos;ll put the reference list in the debate comments.</t>

    <t>== Rebuttals ==    R1) Solar cycle as a driver of climate   It is good that Roy discards the idea that TSI can explain the modern temperature increase. Even skeptical climatologists are beginning to accept this, they note TSI can explain “virtually none” of the warming past 1950 [1].  Roy begins by citing a 1991 study by Friis-Christensen et al (his graph). The study purported to claim the solar cycle length correlated with temperatures. It must be noted Christensen’s temperature data ended in 1985, which ignores a huge portion of the warming which occurred in the 1990s.  Christensen’s study was criticized for mathematical errors. A new paper has come out and corrected the errors from the original paper. The result was solar cycle length did not correlate well with temperature. Solar cycle length did correlate with temperatures until 1985—when the dataset for Friss-Christensen et al. ended—but after 1985, the correlation broke apart. Solar cycle length fell as temperatures began to dramatically increase. The correlation Roy uses in his graph has since been falsified [2]. The following graph shows the updated correlation:          The mathematical errors are shown by this graph [3]:            As can be seen, Roy’s source is flawed and newer measurements prove that solar cycle lengths cannot explain the modern warming.    Roy then cites a paper purportedly claiming 72% of the earth’s increase in temperature is due to the solar cycle. Roy cites a skeptical blog, and the blog exaggerated the findings. 72% of the temperature change in the North Atlantic can be explained by solar fluctuations, according to the study—not global temperatures. If you go to the actual source it says “[w]e find for the Norwegian local stations investigated that 25–56% of the temperature increase the last 150 years may be attributed to the Sun” [emphasis added] [4]. You can see the study is looking into local stations, not global phenomena! Roy’s 72% number is an exaggeration and is in relation to one region, not the entire globe.   Evidence shows global temperatures do NOT correlate with solar cycle lengths, and much of the evidence Roy uses relies upon local Norwegian data. Not global data. Therefore, Roy fails to prove that the sun correlates well with global temperature.     R2) Cosmic rays and climate   For cosmic rays to explain climate change, all of the following must be true: 1) the solar magnetic field must have a long-term negative trend, 2) the cosmic ray flux must have a long-term negative trend, 3) cosmic rays must create low level clouds, 4) low level clouds must have a long term negative trend [5].   The solar magnetic field actually has not changed much over the last 30 years. The correlation between temperature and cosmic rays is fairly weak. Even assuming that the correlation exists, it is about equal to the anti-correlation of TSI (which has been falling, and leading to cooling). Cosmic rays have had little overall impact on temperatures over the last few decades [6].   Have cosmic rays had a long-term negative trend? No. Cosmic rays have had no discernable trend from 1951 to 2006, and have stayed relatively stable [5]. Further, the GCR (galactic cosmic ray) flux only correlated with temperature between 1970 and 1985, and even then it lagged temperature. The correlation totally breaks down in the 1990s. The changes in the GCR flux cannot be the cause of more than 15% of the observed temperature increase [7]. In fact, some research has found the GCR flux is increasing. SkepticalScience, quoting Erlykin et al. 2013, notes “[r]ecent measurements of the cosmic ray intensity show that a former decrease with time has been reversed. Thus, even if cosmic rays enhanced cloud production, there would be a small global cooling, not warming” (emphasis original) [5]. If GCR’s have been causing a net-cooling, they cannot explain the warming trend.   Do GCR’s cause low-level cloud cover? No. The correlation between GCR’s and cloud cover begins to disintegrate in 1989. By 1994, the correlation completely breaks apart, and there is no way that we can see changes in the GCR flux affecting low-level clouds, as can be seen in the graph [8].         Cosmic rays are red, versus low cloud cover (blue). We see little correlation between the two.   Do low-level clouds have a negative effect on temperature? There is conflicting evidence here [5]. Regardless, GCR’s don’t seem to change cloud cover or correlate well with temperature.   R3) The ‘pause’   Roy claims surface temperature has shown no trend recently. He is using RSS data. UAH data finds an increase of temperature over the same period [9].   Over such a short time period, it is impossible to get statistically significant results. So in order to reduce data uncertainty, I will change the data to 1970 – present. With this, we will always see a warming trend. However, if this ‘pause’ is significant, we should see a large change in trends. Using HADCRUT4 data, from 1970 – 1996 (‘pause’ began in 1996) we get .153 C/decade with a margin of error of 0.067. Then to see if the ‘pause’ significantly reduces this trend, I now extend the data from 1970 – 2014. What do I get? 0.165 degrees C per decade with a margin of error 0.030 [9]. We see no decrease in the overall trend, which would occur if the ‘pause’ were significant. And this method reduces data-uncertainty. So we see there is no statistically significant slowdown of the warming trend in HADCRUT4 data.   The long-term trend of increasing temperatures is due to CO2. Short-term variability happens all the time; it does not mean that the long-term increase is going to stabilize forever. La Nina events have decreased surface warming. La Nina is an oscillation, it is not a long-term phenomena, and will revert to a positive trend eventually. Many models that account for these oscillations do reproduce the ‘pause’. When these factors are accounted for, greenhouse warming still continues to exist [10]. The assertion that models cannot account for the pause is simply incorrect.   The oceans increased heat content, aerosol cooling, La Nina events, etc. all lead to cooling. The fact that any warming has happened at all (see my UAH amp; HADCRUT4 analysis) is supportive of idea that CO2 is a strong climate driver.   R4) Paleoclimate   Roy begins by claiming CO2 lags temperature. Although he cites no source (or at least, not in that paragraph) I know where he got the claim. I cited the exact paper with that claim last round! It claimed there was an 800 year lag between past climate changes and CO2 concentrations. What skeptics donapos;t tell us—and what the paper actually said—is CO2 still acted as an amplifier to other climate changes (a positive feedback for the orbital forcing of the interglacial cycle). CO2 preceded northern hemispheric deglaciation. If you actually read the papers, which claim there to be a lag, they almost all note how CO2 acts as an amplifier and how the results do not contradict AGW. There is new research (Shakun et al.), which argued that CO2 preceded the end of the last ice age, and may have (in part) led to the warm interglacial in which we live today [11]. The following graph from the study demonstrates how CO2 may have been an important factor in the most recent deglaciation:         Blue = temperature, Red (and yellow) = CO2 concentrations.   The recent Shakun study demonstrates how CO2 may have, in part, ended the last ice age.     Roy goes on to claim there is no correlation between CO2 and past temperatures. I followed his sources. The first one was temperature data and made no comments on correlation. Berner 2001 is the other source. I cited this exact study last round. I pulled a direct quote out of the study. I will reiterate it here, “over the long term there is indeed a correlation between CO2 and paleotemperature” [R2]. Using Roy’s sources, we see that CO2 does correlate with temperatures.   Roy’s graph is also a oversimplification. It fails to mention that there ARE other forcings in climate. The other major forcing, the sun, does not correlate well with phanerzoic temperatures either. When the two are put together, there is a strong correlation [12]. The sun alone cannot account for temperatures, and CO2 alone cannot account for the temperatures. When put together, they do. This indicates that CO2 is a very important factor in determining climate. The following graph from the paper depicts the correlation when CO2 and the sun are put together:      R5) Consensus   I agree with Roy that consensus does not tell us whether or not science is correct. The consensus is not what makes the science clear. But there is a consensus because the science is clear. And Roy claims his data supports solar theory. However, I have adequately dismantled that argument using peer-reviewed research and Roy’s own sources.   Roy attempts to claim I have the BOP. This is incorrect. A review of the rules in round one tells us, (rule 5) the BOP is split evenly. Therefore, Roy has an equally important role in disproving AGW as I do in proving it.   Roy shows examples of the consensus failing. This can occur, but citing a few high profile cases back when science was less rigorous is not very compelling. Modern science requires empirical evidence for scientific claims. And as most experts believe in AGW, chances are, strong empirical evidence corroborates the theory.   Roy makes a claim about catastrophic warming. This is not what we are debating, it is irrelevant.    Roy claims climategate shows how scientists ‘suppress’ the science. A reading through the emails, in context, really shows no malice was intended [13]. Multiple independent panels have reviewed the emails, and concluded that no scientific malpractice was committed [14].   Conclusion   The sun is not the cause of the recent warming trend. Paleoclimate continues to give credence to the idea that increased CO2 levels warm the climate. Man is the main driver of modern global warming.   Sources:   http://www.debate.org...</t>

    <t>I thank Roy for accepting this debate. He is one of the best debaters on the site and is very knowledgeable on this subject. It is a pleasure to debate him. ==There exists a scientific consensus== Before I continue, I would like to note this argument in and of itself does not prove that global warming is caused by man. Actual evidence should be the driving force behind this debate. The reason I chose to put this in my argument is simple: the science is not clear because of consensus, but a consensus exists because the evidence is clear. This evidence will be discussed later. A study published in Science reviewed the ISI web of science in order to take a survey of relevant climate literature as to what the causes of climate change are. The study failed to find a single paper which was in opposition to the consensus position, that the main driver of climate change is anthropogenic. 75% of the papers supported the consensus position, whereas 25% had no position (they were focused on things other than forgings, like impacts or paleoclimate) [1]. The study also noted how many organizations have come out supporting the idea of anthropogenic climate change. The IPCC, the American Meteorological Society, American Geophysical Union, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science have all concluded that the evidence for AGW is overwhelming [2]. NASA furthers this argument, noting “most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position”. They also argue “[n]inety-seven percent of climate scientists agree that climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities” [3]. A 196 page report representing 13 governmental agencies, and written by 28 authors from scientific institutions, has stated “[t]he global warming of the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced increases in heat-trapping gases” [4]. ==Climate sensitivity== As Roy is well aware, this is the key point in all of climate science (we have discussed this before in a PM). For those who are unaware, climate sensitivity is defined as how much warming is produced by a doubling of CO2. Both skeptics and AGW supporters agree that the direct effect of doubling CO2 is one degree C, the debate is over feedbacks [5]. First, what is a feedback? Climate skeptic Roy Spencer explains it fairly simply. He describes a forcing as how much temperature change occurs. A feedback determines how large the change in temperatures will be. Feedbacks refer to how clouds and other warming/cooling mechanisms change in response to a forcing (i.e. CO2, TSI, CRs). He also explains positive and negative feedbacks. Take a car, for example. The temperature forcing would be the sun beating down on the car. Opening the window slowly would cool the car, over time, and be a negative feedback. On the other hand, if you were to close the window, the car would warm (due to an enhanced greenhouse effect), which would be a positive feedback [6]. So the question is whether or not the climate is dominated by negative or positive feedbacks. There is even the possibility of there being no feedbacks, as the positive and negatives could cancel each other out. Research by climate skeptics published in Climate Research has demonstrated that climate sensitivity, based on model means, is 1.9 degrees C. Using differing methods of empirical approaches, they conclude that climate sensitivity is 1 – 1.6 degrees C [7]. Although these estimates shy towards having no net-amplifier, the no-amplification scenario still supports a strong influence of man on climate. In fact, to put an answer numerically, about 50% of the warming would be caused by man if there was no net-feedback [8]. Assuming no amplifier, research has found that “the largest contribution to the 20th century warming comes from anthropogenic sources” [9]. They find that of the ~0.7 degree C temperature rise in the 20th century (some estimates slightly higher), about 0.4 degrees of that are due to anthropogenic forgings, or about 57% of the warming (personal calculation from these skeptical studies and personal correspondence with their authors). A significant body of research notes that climate sensitivity is likely much higher. A review of the evidence in 2008 finds that mean climate sensitivity is 3 degrees C, with a range of 2 – 4.5 degrees C. Based on multiple lines of evidence, we see *almost* every which way to measure climate sensitivity leads to approximately the same result: a doubling of CO2 will lead to 3 degrees C of temperature rise [10]. The following graphic from the study corroborates this:   The gray is the range (2 – 4.5 degrees C), the line in the center is on 3 degrees C, and the circles in the lines are the ‘very likely’ ranges. Most of them rest on the 3 degree mark, with some under and some above. Therefore, we can conclude that from these lines of evidence, mean sensitivity is about 3 degrees C. Another study replicates the above conclusions. The upper limit for climate sensitivity is around 4 degrees C, and certainly below 6 degrees C. Using a Bayesian statistical approach, which is “the dominant [method] in the literature”, these findings support the notion of climate sensitivity as maximum 4 degrees C, a mean of 3 degrees C, and likely not lower than 3 degrees [11]. The following graph [12] again details the results of many different studies. The best estimates generally center around 2.5 – 3 degrees C.   Some evidence published in 2012 claims sensitivity is on the low end of the spectrum, however, still note that “[h]umanity is . . . responsible for the most recent period of warming from 1976 to 2010” [13]. The fact is, climate sensitivity is high and the climate system is predominated by positive feedback mechanisms. Whether it be due to changes in clouds, increased water vapor, or long-term albedo changes. With a climate sensitivity of 1 (no positive or negative forcings), anthropogenic CO2 still causes up to 50% of the warming. With a climate sensitivity of 3 degrees C, humanity is the main driver of climate from about 1976 through present (see, e.g., [13]). ==Paleoclimate== There is significant evidence from paleoclimate records that CO2 can have an effect on changes in the climate. Climate skeptic and paleoclimatologist Bob Carter emphasizes the importance of paleoclimate data. He compares climate to a piece of string. The current instrumental data (1850 – present) is a very short period of time, according to Carter. And when the ‘string’ is lengthened, we see a lot of climactic variability. Instead of looking at the recent past, we should look at the entire temperature record in order to get an accurate picture of the climate [14]. I will provide evidenc, contrary to what Carter believes, lengthening the string supports AGW theory. Over the Cenozoic Era, which began 66 million years ago, we see clear warming and cooling cycles caused by changes in CO2 concentrations. The sun increased slightly over that time period, whereas temperatures cooled. CO2, however, fell steadily through that time period. Plate tectonics was also accounted for. With natural forcings an unlikely cause, “CO2 was the dominant climate forcing in the Cenozoic” [15]. When you lengthen the ‘string’ over the course of the entire Phanerozoic (500 million years; begins at the Cambrian) there is still evidence of CO2 driving multiple climate changes. The GEOCARB study, published in 2001, is one of the definitive proxy records for CO2 concentrations within the last 500 million years. The study notes that “over the long term there is indeed a correlation between CO2 and paleotemperature” [16]. Evidence from the Vostok ice cores (specifically 240,000 before present), proves that CO2 has had an effect on temperatures. Although the initial forcing was orbital changes in the sun, CO2 “plays . . . a key role in amplifying the initial orbital forcing” and “the CO2 increase clearly precedes the Northern Hemi sphere deglaciation”. The study also notes that these forcings “are also at work for the present-day and future climate” [17]. There is also proof that it is warmer now than it has been since the MWP. In fact, it is warmer now than any year since 1400 AD [18]. Newer reconstructions continue to support this finding, and even extends the dataset. It finds that the Roman warm period (RWP) and the MWP as much cooler than today, and claims to have replicated previous ‘hockey stick’ studies [19]. The results are depicted below.   Looking into the geologic past, we see strong evidence in favor of the idea that carbon dioxide can increase temperature. It logically follows that if humans continue to emit CO2, and other greenhouse gasses, that human emissions will increase temperatures. Conclusion: It is clear as to *why* a scientific consensus exists. There is overwhelming evidence that 1) climate sensitivity is likely high, 2) even if it wasn’t, anthropogenic forces still account for 50% or more of the warming (from CO2 alone, not counting methane and other greenhouse gases), and 3) that when you ‘lengthen’ the piece of string, there is still ample evidence ample evidence supporting the fact that CO2 can drive temperatures. The consensus itself does not prove AGW—but the evidence proves the consensus. CO2 is the main driver of recent temperature changes.   Sources:  http://www.debate.org...</t>

    <t>AGW Models fail, so the theory is wrongWe have agreed on a couple of basic points of climate science: 1. If AGW is true then warming should occur as a straight line over time. 2. The heat output of the sun is not changing, so that isnapos;t upsetting the straight line AGW So, if AGW has dominated climate over last century then we should see a straight line increase in temperature over the century, with just short term variations due to weather. Here is the temperature data. Pro told us in his initial argument that the minimum value for climate sensitivity under AGW is 3 degrees per century. He said it might be more, but itapos;s at least three degrees. To test if AGW dominates climate, we can see how close the temperature data is to a straight line with a three dree slope. I took the temperature from Wikipedia [1] and added the line (in blue) predicted by AGW:  Clearly AGW theory is wrong. Itapos;s possible that carbon dioxide is adding a temperature increase to climate just as AGW predicts, but that some other unaccounted factor is canceling the AGW before about 1980 and after about 2000. Our debate is about whether AGW dominates climate, so if it is try that an unknown factor completely changes climate from what AGW contributes, then it is the unknown factor that dominates, not AGW.  Why did a theory so far from the data ever take hold? The problem AGW attempts to explain is the rise from about 1980 to 1996, and many atmospheric scientists could not come up with an explanation other than CO2. To explain all the pre-1980 data that did not conform, Professor Mann and his colleagues came up with the Hockey Stick curve, that purported to show that climate had not changed at all in the past 1000 years. The Hockey Stick turned out to be the product of a bad statistical method that selected proxies for temperature that were unrelated to temperature. The current Wikipedia article on the Hockey Stick shows the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age as global climate change. Both are explained by solar magnetic theory.  The fatal blow to AGW theory is the lack of warming since 1996. The blue curve on the graph shows how far we are below the AGW theoretical prediction. Pro argues that the HADCru data shows some warming, but there is close to universal agreement that the models have failed. HADCru uses ground station data which focuses on urban areas that warm due to growth with surrounding population increase. The satellite data covers the whole earth with no such complications. NASA acknowledges the pause in global warming [2] the ‘pause’ in global surface temperature that began in 1997, according to some estimates, continues,” wrote David Whitehouse, who holds a doctorate in astrophysics and was the BBC’s science editor. “Statistically speaking there has been no trend in global temperatures over this period.” HADCru fully acknowledges the existence of the pause in global warming, but dutifully insists that the underlying AGW has just been overcome by other factors. Those factors must, of course, now dominate AGW. [3] Papers by von Storch [4] and Rasmussen [5], both previously vigorous defenders of AGW, show the AGW models have failed. Not only have the models failed, but there is no way to tweak them, say by changing climate sensitivity, to get them to fit the data. A book by Tisdale [6] shows graphically that the models cannot be fixed.  Measures of Solar ActivityRemember, Iapos;m not obliged to explain why the AGW models have failed, only that there is no possibility that the AGW linear trend of 3 degrees per century, which Pro claimed as all but certain science, is not true so that AGW is not dominating climate. The exact nature of the sunapos;s influence on climate is not known, and Pro argues convoincingly that the length of the solar cycle has not been born out as being as good a predictor as thought. Nonetheless the correlation to solar activity remains strong. The long Medieval Cold Period, the Medieval Warm Period, and the Little Ice Age all corrsponded to solar activity. [6]Right now we are in a period of decreasing sunspot activity [7]:  That the correlation to sunspot activity is not perfect means no more than that climate is complex. To say that AGW dominates climate is unfounded, because there is all but universal agreement that the models have failed.Paleoclimate That CO2 lags warming is uncontested basic physics. As the oceans heat, CO2 comes out of solution and CO2 enters the atmosphere. If it amplifies heating trends, that is no proof that CO2 dominates climate. Whatever starts and ends the heating trend dominates climate and CO2 magnifies the swings in boith directions.Whether the present is warmer than the Medieval Warm Period or the Roman Warm Period is not the slightest proof of what caused any of the warming or cooling. What is does show is that substantial warming in past climate has happened without any CO2 effect. If we got nearly as warm as the present in the MWP. then whatever caused that was not CO2 and may be working now.The long history of climate shows very little relationship to CO2, and Pro acknoweldges that. So what factors were at work, and how do we know what is at work now?  Variations in the earthapos;s orbit are not nearly enough to explain the changes. We have some ideas, but there is nothing thatapos;s proved reliable, especially not AGW theory.Pro burden is no more than to prove that AGW dominates climate. He has not done so.</t>

    <t>AGW exists, it but doesnapos;t dominate climate Greenhouse gases cause warming, and I never claimed otherwise. Pro cited a skeptical climate scientist acknowledgment that AGW plays some role in climate. Our resolution is “Global warming is man made.” That might mean that global warming is entirely man made, in which case Pro has conceded it is not, because he has acknowledged that there are also natural causes. I didnapos;t take that meaning. I said repeatedly that Pro must prove that climate is dominated by AGW. I must prove it does not. The proof of AGW would be a AGW math mathematical model of climate that accurately explains and predicts. Weather effects are yearly variations; climate comprises trends over several years. The AGW models fail because the models do not predict or explain climate the large trends in climate. For example, Pro acknowledges that Medieval Warm Period was due to solar activity, but the official IPCC models have no mechanism that explains the MWP. Because AGW models cannot explain the MWP, climate crisis advocates have fought consistently to make the MWP disappear as a global climate phenomena. The Hockey Stick got rid of it by a statistical error, but the data ultimately won. A change in climate acknowledged to be very close to modern warming is unexplained by the models we are supposed to accept as reliable. The pause in global warming is real Pro argued that an 17 year pause in global warming might just be “noise,” and he cited a scientific paper that allegedly shows that. Thatapos;s bad science. Suppose an engineer designed a building taking into account all the other factors he knew to affect design, and the building subsequently collapsed. Consider: “The design models were correct. The building collapsed due to unknown factors categorized as noise. There is no need for further explanation.” Nonsense. Fundamental failures are not noise. An eighteen year failure of climate prediction shows that the model is defective. Since AGW is in the model, and something else canceled it, the unknown factor dominated climate over the period. I quoted both HADCru and NASA scientists as acknowledging the pause in global warming. The paper by AGW-advocate von Storch established that the current models cannot be tweaked to explain the pause. Pro found some oddball paper that made a model that shows a pause, but models can be made to do anything desired. AGW theory is not validated until after it makes accurate predictions. Making a new, unproved model means we are back to the starting point. Pro said that HADCru land data showed an increase. Year-to-year variations occur with weather, and so there is so uncertainty in the trends due to the accuracy of fitting a line through the weather-induced variations. The HADCru data shows 0.09 +/- 0.11 degree of global warming over the period of the pause, compared to the 0.4 to 1 degree predicted by the AGW models. None of the six global temperature data sets showed a statistically significant increase. [http://wattsupwiththat.com...] The land data sets are the least accurate because increasing urbanization drives up the temperatures near many of the weather station locations, due to the so-called “heat island” effect. The satellite data is the most accurate because it samples the earth uniformly, and it shows no increase. HADCru scientists understand the large departure from the models, and acknowledge the pause. Pro said I acknowledged that the Sun could not be causing the pause in global warming. Thatapos;s not true, but if it were true, it would not help Proapos;s case. If itapos;s not the sun, then a completely unsuspected factor dominated climate and overwhelmed AGW. However, what I acknowledged was that the length of the previous solar cycle was not a good predictor. I presented the historical graph that showed the level of sunspot activity correlated well with the warmth of the MWP, the cold of the Little Ice Age, and the warming of the 20th century. Pro acknowledged the solar cause of those changes. Sunspots do not correlate to the heat output of the sun, so the effect on climate must be a different physical cause: magnetic field, cosmic rays, ultraviolet spectrum, or something else. It might be some complex combination of the effects. The graphs show that cold climate is associated with low sunspot activity and warm climate with high sunspot activity. The 20th century covered a long period of high sunspot activity, which explains the warming. Recently, sunspot activity has dropped, correlated to the pause. The number of sunspots remains a reliable longer term climate predictor. AGW predicts straight line temperature increase I presented a graph showing actual global temperatures and AGW predicting a strong straight line increase. My graph is accurate, but I should have better explained the AGW line in comparison to the actual climate data. Here is the graph, repeated from the earlier round:   Temperature responds to the logarithm of greenhouse gas density, and greenhouse gas density has been increasing exponentially. The log of an exponential is a straight line. As far as I know, all climate scientists agree on this. Therefore, AGW should produce a straight line. Pro said that the models also include some natural effects like volcanoes, so the model predictions need not be a straight line increase. However, the debate resolution is that AGW dominates climate. While natural causes upset the perfect straight line behavior to some degree, they cannot dominate. While there may be some blips, like the blip of cold for a couple years from the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo, there should be no problem recognizing a straight line. The temperature data is not close to any straight line, so AGW is not dominating. We are far below what the models predict for the present year. The slope of the line of temperature increase over time depends both on climate sensitivity and the rate of carbon dioxide increase. The behavior of temperature with CO2 is logarithmic, so Proapos;s computation of what it should be is way off. Initially a small increase in CO2 produces a large increase in temperature, with later increases in CO2 having less and less effect. Suppose CO2 increased in units from 1 to 16, and that the increase from from 1 to 2 brought one degree of warming. That means that there would be four degrees of warming at 16, CO2 having doubled four times. Linear interpolation, which is what Pro did, between 1 and 16 says that there should be (1/15) of the 4 degrees, 0.27 degree, at 2 units. In fact, there was 1 degree of increase at the 2 unit point, four times as much as linear interpolation erroneously yields. The temperature rise is not line between 1 and 2 or between 2 and 4, or anywhere on the curve. I converted the combined effect of climate sensitivity and CO2 increase into a linear number of degrees increase per century increase. The official estimate by the US Environment Protection Agency, referencing the IPCC, is 2.2 to 6.1 degrees C by 2100. (I converted from the EPAapos;s F) [http://www.epa.gov...] Thatapos;s 2.6 to 7.1 degrees per century. The range includes both the allowed variation in the estimates of climate sensitivity and the possibility that CO2 output may drop near the end of the century, as substitutes for fossil fuels become more significant. Departure from exponential growth is in the future so I used 3 degrees per century to represent the low end of climate sensitivity estimates that AGW theory allows. Itapos;s a coincidence that matches 3 degrees for doubling CO2. The earth should have warmed by 0.4 to 1 degree since 2000, but in fact as measured by the satellites there was no change, and in all data sets show no statistically significant change. The graph shows temperature anomaly, so where the blue line ought to originate depends upon when one believes AGW began to dominate climate. AGW theory was invented to explain the temperature rise from about 1980 to 1996, so thatapos;s where I put the AGW prediction line. The Hockey stick claimed that nothing happened to climate for a thousand years before about 1970. If the claim is that AGW dominated the entire 20th century, then the line should start at 1900. If climate sensitivity is 0.7, way below any AGW official estimate, then the line is about 0.5 degree per century. and AGW no longer explains the rise in the 80s and 90s. Wrong consensus derives from common error When science reaches a wrong consensus, scientists point to the data that they used to proclaim that the wrong consensus is well founded. I gave several examples. For AGW, it was the rapid temperature increase in the 80s and 90s that “proved” the theory. Some AGW is in the climate, but the long pause proves it is not the dominant factor. Paleoclimate In the hundred million year history of climate, CO2 shows no relation to temperature. The laws of nature do not change. Itapos;s not enough to say that things were different back then. The changes in the orbit of the earth were too small to explain the climate variation. The likely missing link is the solar variation other than heat output that caused the MWP. CO2 released from the ocean will increase heating, and CO2 going back into solution will amplify cooling. Those are natural, not anthropogenic, factors and they do nothing to explain what drives the trend in either direction. (I wrongly identified my reference for the lag in CO2; itapos;s 3-5.) The Debate Proapos;s rules for the debate say that we have an equal burden to prove that AGW does or not dominate climate. Thatapos;s fine with me. If AGW was the dominant factor in climate, then we should have observed a straight line increase in temperature since 1980, and we clearly have not. Since Pro has not met his burden of showing that AGW dominates, Iapos;ve met my burden to show it has not. Thanks to Pro for a fine debate. It will be most fascinating to people interested in logarithms.</t>

    <t>== Roy’s calculation ==   Roy’s assumption that warming is linear is simply untrue:  Even though CO2 is the dominant climate driver of modern climate-change, it does not mean natural climate variability cannot occur in the system—it does occur. A few ‘pauses’ or unprecedented accelerations do occur. CO2 is logarithmic in relation to temperature. This means that every CO2 doubling has the same effect, even though each molecule warms less. For example, a doubling from 100 ppm to 200 ppm would have the same effect as a doubling from 280 to 560 ppm. Warming will only occur fairly linearly if each doubling occurs at the same rate.  His calculation uses faulty assumptions. His 3 degrees C slope is from my former argument that CO2 sensitivity is around 3 degrees C. Sensitivity is for each CO2 doubling.  His line begins in about 1970, and CO2 has not doubled from 1970 to now (in terms of the pre-industrial levels). In 1970 there was about 323 ppm of CO2, and in 2014 the number is around 400 [1][2]. So over that time period, CO2 increased 77 ppm. That would only be about 13.2% of a CO2 doubling. So .132 * 3 is about .4 degrees temperature rise since 1970. It has warmed about 0.5 degrees since the 1970s [3]. Therefore when Roy’s calculation is done correctly, CO2 is responsible for 80% of the temperature rise over that time period.    == Climate model accuracy ==    Roy argues that global circulation models (GCMs) are inaccurate. This is untrue. Climate models actually have accurately reproduced temperature since 1900. GCMs cannot replicate warming without a CO2 forcing.  GCM’s are only accurate when CO2 forcing is accounted for in  hindcasts. This means that CO2 is a large forcing of modern climate. This can be demonstrated with the following graph [4]:   Models also reproduced temperatures after the Mt. Pinatubo eruption. They correctly predicted the temporary 0.5 degrees C cooling after the eruption, meaning models can replicate temperature changes due to aerosol and sulfate forcings [4].  A paper published in Nature looked at each 15 year period since the 1950s. Their models were able to accurately produce those trends as well as many El Nino events. The study even commented on the pause. The authors note that the pause does not falsify model accuracy, as it is only “one realization where the decadal natural variability component of the model climate is generally not in phase with observations” [5]. In other words, it is the exception rather than the rule. Models accurately predict warming trends, one exception does not falsify the models. In fact, they note models still were able to predict recent trends in the Pacific—a huge portion of the world.  Hansen’s 1988 model, unlike what skeptics claim, shows close correspondence with the actual temperature change. His model seemingly assumes more warming due to the fact he assumed 25% too much climate sensitivity. When the sensitivity is lowered to 3 degrees C, his scenario B correlates perfectly with observed temperatures [6]. The model offers evidence of a 3 degrees C climate sensitivity. Models can accurately hindcast warming which occurred in the last century and models can accurately predict the cooling forcings of aerosols. Further, the 1988 model predictions were correct, indicating that models can predict future temperatures.    == The ‘pause’ ==    The argument that the ‘pause’ disproves global warming is incorrect. The fact that other forcings can *temporarily* blunt the warming effect of CO2 is not a nail in the coffin. Unless Roy denies the greenhouse effect, it is preposterous to claim that CO2 cannot influence temperatures. The fact that natural forcings have caused a short-term ‘pause’ does not disprove AGW. Some models actually have predicted the ‘pause’ [7].   The Met Office has released a report regarding the ‘pause’. They note that the earth’s heat content is still increasing, and is actually increasing faster than ever before. Surface warming has slowed due to the fact that the oceans have been accumulating more heat. This effect is temporary. Eventually, the ocean’s heat content will ‘max out’, and surface warming will resume. So CO2 is still warming the climate system [8]. As noted, this effect is temporary, and as heat continues to accumulate the  oceans will warm, and surface temperatures will eventually begin to increase. CO2 forcing has not stopped—its heat is merely being distributed elsewhere.  The earth’s surface has stopped warming not due to CO2 not being a greenhouse gas, but rather its heat content being distributed elsewhere. There is still doubt as to whether or not the ‘pause’ is real (as I noted last round).  Tamino, a statistician, has worked out the data. Using each possible start date for the ‘pause’, he ran the p-value of statistical significance. For each start date, none of them reach the 95% statistical significance level. Therefore, no matter which data-set you use, no matter what start date you use, there is no proof of a statistically significant slowdown in global temperatures. The following chart [9] details the results:   Therefore, there is little proof that a ‘pause’ is occurring at all.    == Solar activity ==   Roy argues the sun caused the LIA and the MWP. I agree! CO2 was fairly stable in those time periods, so it could not have been the forcing. Climate reacts to whatever is forcing it to change at the time. As I convincingly argued (CON’s words), the sun cannot be the current forcing. CO2 has been increasing, and likely is the current climate forcing. I never said that the sun couldn’t affect climate. I merely stated that cosmic rays do not change the climate, and that the sun is not the driver of current climate change. As noted, solar forcing has been decreasing, meaning it cannot be the cause of modern warming.   TSI has been falling, GCR’s have been increasing, and solar cycle lengths have fallen as temperature dramatically increased. The sun cannot be the forcing behind the current warming—it is impossible. I have cited many peer-reviewed studies corroborating those conclusions.    == Paleoclimate ==   This entire argument proved that CO2 has the potential to change climate. CON claims I said CO2 does not correlate with temperature. This is a massive misinterpretation. I first cited the study which every paleoclimatologist uses in their datasets, the GEOCARB study. The study found that CO2 did correlate with temperature. I then cited Royer 2006, which noted how CO2 does correlate with temperature when 1) pH effects are corrected for, and 2) the sun is accounted for. The sun does not correlate with temperatures, but it obviously affects climate. It only correlates with temperatures when CO2 forcing is included. Therefore, we can conclude that CO2 is one of the main drivers of past climate. This proves that CO2 has the ability to warm the planet, meaning the increased emissions have had a warming effect.  Research using proxy data over the last 500 million years find a climate sensitivity of 3 degrees C [9]. This supports the idea that the modern increase of CO2 concentrations are having a large effect on modern climate.  Roy again claims the CO2 lag refutes AGW. I already responded to this. CO2 has lagged temperatures over the previous interglacial periods, I agree. But CO2 acts as an amplifier in those conditions. If CO2 amplifies temperature, it has a warming effect. If it has a warming effect, it can be a forcing. Therefore, CO2 has an effect on temperature, and can be the driving force behind modern climate change. The lag argument was solidly refuted last round.  Roy also dropped my argument about CO2 causing the end of the last ice-age. This argument definitively proves that CO2 has a massive impact on temperatures.  The fact that it is warmer now than in the MWP demonstrates that the current warming is unprecedented. I have proven that the modern warm period is warmer now than at any point during the past 2000+years.    == Burden of proof ==    Roy claims I have not proven AGW. This is incorrect.  When it comes to sensitivity, CO2 has a *direct* effect on temperature: each doubling causes about 1.1 degrees C warming. Using calculations from a skeptical physicist [10], this direct effect means that CO2 has caused over 50% of the recent warming. Sensitivity is likely much higher, about 3 degrees C. With higher sensitivity, CO2 causes more warming. This is corroborated with studies using many different methods. With the high sensitivity proven (R1), CO2 is the main factor of modern climate change. Roy dropped this argument.  I proved there was a scientific consensus. This suggests the empirical evidence almost certainly corroborates AGW theory. I proved that CO2 is one of the main forcings in past climate. This is important because it dispels any doubts that CO2 has a large warming potential. In fact, paleoclimate proves 3 degrees sensitivity. Therefore, this also proves that CO2 is the main driver of modern climate change.  I have proven that CO2 does change climate. The direct effect of CO2 (which no one disputes) causes over 50% of climate change, and when sensitivity is 3 degrees C, CO2 is the cause of the warming since 1970. I have upheld the BOP. Roy, on the other hand, has failed to explain *why* CO2 is either not a forcing, or that my sensitivity estimate is wrong. He drops the sensitivity argument, conceding that CO2 is the main driver of warming in the modern era. His alternative explanation, the sun, was eviscerated last round. His arguments about a ‘pause’ are also put into question, and his model argument is based upon flawed assumptions. I have, on many occasions, cited Roy’s evidence against him. Low sensitivity proves AGW, high sensitivity proves AGW, and Roy totally ignored that key point. Therefore, I have proven that AGW exists, whereas Roy fails to put a dent into the extremely well supported theory.    Thanks for the debate, Roy, it was fun!

    <t>I would like to thank TylerGraham95 for this truly excellent debate. Iapos;ve learned a lot from your arguments and my own research. In this round, I will consider the objections my opponent has to my arguments. The Sun My opponent is making two mistakes. One in thermodynamics, and the other in how solar activity is measured. Solar activity is the highest is about 8000 years. Here is a graph showing sunspot number over the past 10000 years:   [1] While solar activity has decreased, it is still at a very high level compared to recent times in the Earthapos;s history. This means that the temperature will still increase because solar activity is still historically high. Even on the scale of the 20th century, solar activity is high.“Clearly the sun’s activity and output experienced an upwards step-change around 1950. The average monthly sunspots in the second half of the century were, for example, 50% higher than in the first half of the century.” Overall, because solar activity is still high in comparison, temperatures continue to increase.[2] As for the error in how solar activity is measured, “Since the late 1970s, the amount of solar radiation the sun emits, during times of quiet sunspot activity, has increased by nearly .05 percent per decade... This trend is important because, if sustained over many decades, it could cause significant climate change... TSI [Total Solar Irradiance] interaction with the Earthapos;s atmosphere, oceans and landmasses is the biggest factor determining our climate.” So thereapos;s still more solar radiation reaching Earth than earlier.[3] See this graph:   It shows a peak right at the time that temperature was increasing quickly, and decreases right before the temperature decrease (see below). Finally, consider the global temperature stagnation over the last 15 years. If the satellite based temperature is considered (which starts in the 1970s) there is an unmistakable pause in global warming starting around 2000:   [4] Overall, thermodynamics, how solar activity should really be measured, and the pause in global warming all show how the sun is still the dominant factor determining the climate. The Hockey Stick The hockey stick is wildly inaccurate: “The dataset used to make this construction contained collation errors, unjustified truncation or extrapolation of source data, obsolete data, incorrect principal component calculations, geographical mislocations and other serious defects. These errors and defects substantially affect the temperature index. The major finding is that the values in the early 15th century exceed any values in the 20th century. The particular hockey stick shape derived in the MBH98 proxy construction a temperature index that decreases slightly between the early 15th century and early 20th century and then increases dramatically up to 1980 is primarily an artefact of poor data handling, obsolete data and incorrect calculation of principal components.”[5][6] Temperatures have been warmer than today as recently as 1300 ACE.quot;During the Medieval Warming... . Temperatures may have been as much as 2.5 degrees C warmer [than today] due to a southward shift of the climate belts.quot;[7] This graph shows the hockey stick graph and the corrected version of it:   Cosmic Rays My opponentapos;s whole argument against cosmic rays is one whole quote that provides no evidence for its conclusion. I have made a sufficient case for how cosmic rays amplify the sunapos;s effects on the climate, and my opponent has not touched it. As for the Forbes source (I contend that Popsci isnapos;t bad, but Iapos;ll leave that alone to save space), thank you for pointing that out. That was part of a two-year old argument that I need to get rid of. Here is a better source: “Ironically, solar explosions, which produce their own deadly radiation, sweep away the even deadlier cosmic rays. As flares subside, cosmic rays intensify.” Further, this Nature study shows how cosmic rays cause cloud formation (source 9). I feel like Iapos;ve supported my cloud argument enough, and with good sources to preclude me from having to post more on that matter.[8][9] To conclude, hereapos;s a graph:   [5]The bottom graph corrects for a few variables, so it shows a better correlation.  Extraterrestrial Warming Iapos;ve addressed the argument about solar irradiance, and the source I posted showed how all the planets were warming. Unfortunately, thereapos;s not enough evidence on this, but thereapos;s sufficient evidence that Mars, the Moon, Jupiter, Pluto, and Neptune are warming, and indirect evidence that the other planets are warming. This shows the comparison between the Sunapos;s, the Earthapos;s, and Neptuneapos;s activity:   [5]Noitce how they all follow the same pattern, which shows theyapos;re connected.  I need to develop my argument more in other places, so considering my opponent doesnapos;t consider this argument much either, Iapos;ll leave it at this. Source 10 (one of the blogs my opponent says is invalid) contains peer-reviewed articles of that evidence, however.[10][11] The Sun, Cosmic Rays, and the Evidence for Natural Warming quot;In particular, a quasi-60-year large cycle is quite evident since 1650 in all climate and astronomical records herein studied ... The existence of a natural 60-year cyclical modulation of the global surface temperature induced by astronomical mechanisms, by alone, would imply that at least 60 to 70% of the warming observed since 1970 has been naturally induced.quot;[12][13] quot;For example, the authors of a paper by NASAapos;s JPL remark apos;...has compared the minimum aa [index of geomagnetic activity] values with the Earthapos;s surface temperature record and found a correlation of 0.95 between the two data sets starting in 1885. The solar irradiance [solar activity] proxy developed from the aa minima continues to track the Earthapos;s surface temperature until the present.apos;quot;[14][15] As for Scafetta and West, the paper my opponent cites acknowledges that there might be a non-CO2 reason why this is true. See the whole paragraph after my opponentapos;s quote in my source 16 (his source 3 from round 3). Further, they argue in a different article that “...the current anthropogenic contribution to global warming is significantly overestimated. We estimate that the Sun could account for as much as 69% [from a different starting year] the increase in Earthapos;s average temperature, depending on the TSI reconstruction used.” Overall, my opponentapos;s argument against this study does not hold water.[16][17] A solar explanation for the recent global warming is the only one that agrees with its predictions and the observations made. The actual scientific data does not agree with him. Attack on Opponentapos;s Sources My source 3 also says this: “[Fred] Singer counters the standard scientific stance that changes in solar activity are not significant enough to have an effect, stating that solar variability is much greater in ultraviolet regions, thus having a significant effect on ozone levels and consequently a major impact on atmospheric circulation.” It takes an objective standpoint (it doesnapos;t take sides), and I was only citing it to show the solar cycle length/temperature correlation. Singer has a PhD in physics (heapos;s reliable). Iapos;ve already conceded my sources 5 and 6 and have exchanged them for better ones. Again, thank you for calling me out on it. Watts Up With That is a bit complicated. For one, while itapos;s run by Anthony Watts, most of the articles are by guest authors, often with degrees explaining their papers, or use reputable sources if written by Watts. You can take a look at each individual article for yourself and see that they have substantiation. Further, “Patrick J. Michaels, climatologist and contributor to the IPCC first assessment report, described WUWT as part of a new quot;parallel universequot; of emerging online publications, manned by serious scientists critical of world governments approach to climate change: apos;A parallel universe is assembling itself parallel to the IPCC. This universe has become very technical – very proficient at taking apart the U.N.apos;s findings.apos;” Michaels has a PhD in environmental climatology.[18][19] The book Unstoppable Global Warming: Every 1,500 Years is very reliable. It contains 499 studies for substantiation, including a large number substantiating the quotes I made. While past climactic conditions donapos;t negate AGW, if there were periods in recent history that were much hotter and warmed much quicker than the recent global warming, that throws suspicion and the supposed remark-ability of the recent global warming. It also provides evidence for a solar explanation and against an anthropogenic explanation. Sources 9 and 11 do provide reliable sources, and source 9 itself looks pretty good. Iapos;ll concede source 12, but I feel the quote I quoted from it makes general sense. Source 20 provides a better source for that quote (regarding the distribution of solar radiation).[20] Finally, now my own attack on one of my opponentapos;s sources – Skeptical Science. Just to take one example, “The fact that there has been no statistically-significant global warming for 16 years is described as a “myth”. Yet the least-squares linear-regression trend on the Hadley Centre/CRU dataset favoured by the IPCC indeed shows no statistically-significant warming for 16 years.” Iapos;ve shown this above. Thereapos;s a list of 11 more points in source 21.[21] Also from that source, “Yet half of the 129 signatories are Professors; two-thirds are PhDs, and several are Expert Reviewers for the IPCC’s forthcoming Fifth Assessment Report.” Another confirmation on WUWT.[21] Conclusion I have shown how a solar cause to the recent global warming is the only reasonable explanation, much better than a human-caused greenhouse gas cause. The latter theory simply has too many problems with it to hold any water, while the formerapos;s case is practically airtight, save an exact description of how the sun affects the climate. It is known that it does, however, even recently. Overall, mankind is not the main cause of global warming. Sources Sources in comments.</t>

    <t>I would like to thank tylergraham95 for presenting his well-thought out arguments. In this round, I will post arguments against an anthropogenic cause to the recent global warming, and also consider as much as I can of my opponentapos;s argument. Arguments Against Human-Caused Global Warming There are many indicators that point to CO2 emissions not being the cause of the modern global warming.First, CO2 is actually a lagging indicator compared to temperature. As it turns out, temperature may be whatapos;s causing CO2 levels to rise. quot;The most recent study on this concluded that the results of their tedious but meticulous analysis led them to ultimately conclude that quot;the CO2 increase lagged Antarctic deglacial warming by 800 +/- 200 years.quot; There is also shorter correlations, but again, temperature seems to cause CO2 rise instead of the reverse.[1][2]This graph shows just one of the lags:   Second, according to the greenhouse effect, global warming should be starting from the lower atmosphere and moving to the surface (because the CO2 collects in the upper troposphere first). However, this is not happening. quot;...satellite and high-altitude balloon data confirm that the lower atmosphere is not trapping lots of additional heat due to higher CO2 concentrations. It is hard to know how fast the Earthapos;s highly variable surface is warming, but it is warming faster than the lower atmosphere where the CO2 is accumulating. This is strong evidence that CO2 is not the primary climate factor.quot;[3]Here is a graph showing how the surface has warmed more than the troposphere:   (The blue line is lower tropospheric temperatures)Third, global warming is not starting at the poles like it should be, by the greenhouse theory. In fact, there has been general, relative cooling: quot;If the greenhouse theory were valid, temperatures in the Arctic and the Antarctic would have risen several degrees Celsius since 1940 due to the huge emissions of man-made CO2... Recently, a team led by the University of Chicagoapos;s Peter Doran published a paper in Nature saying, apos;Although previous reports suggest recent continental warming, our spatial analysis of Antarctic meteorological data demonstrates a net cooling on the Antarctic continent between 1966 and 2000apos;. The data from 21 Antarctic surface stations show an average continental decline of 0.008 degrees C from 1978 to 1998, and the infrared data from satellites operating since 1979 show a decline of 0.42 degrees C per decade. David W. J. Thompson of Colorado State University and Susan Soloman of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration also report a cooling trend in the Antarctic interior.quot;[3][4]To illustrate, here is a picture of the southern hemisphere sea ice anomaly, which shows that southern sea ice is actually increasing: [5] Fourth, current levels of CO2 have very little effect on temperature. The greenhouse effect certainly exists, but it doesnapos;t become linearly stronger with increasing amounts of CO2. CO2apos;s effect on temperature is logarithmic, meaning that each additional increase has a smaller effect on the climate than the last. quot;The carbon that is already up in the atmosphere absorbs most of the light it can. CO2 only soaks up its favorite wavelengths of light and itapos;s close to its saturation point. It manages to grab a bit more light from wavelengths that are close to its favorite bands but it canapos;t do much more, because there are not many left-over photons at the right wavelengths.quot; This has to do with how CO2apos;s absorption spectrum overlaps with water vaporapos;s.[1][6][7]This chart shows approximately the effect that each additional increment of CO2 increase has on temperature: Note how the pre-industrial to modern level increase has had less than a 0.2 C increase in temperature.Fifth and most importantly, the predicted quot;hot-spotquot; 10 miles above the tropics that would be a signature of CO2-induced global warming is absent. quot;The computer models show that greenhouse warming will cause a hot-spot at an altitude between 8 and 12 km over the tropics between 30 N and 30 S. The temperature at this hot-spot is projected to increase at a rate of two to three times faster than at the surface. However, the Hadley Centreapos;s real-world plot of radiosonde temperature observations shown below does not show the projected CO2 induced global warming hot-spot at all. The predicted hot-spot is entirely absent from the observational record. This shows that atmosphere warming theory programmed into climate models are wrong.quot;[1]Here is the plot of predicted temperature changes due to CO2:   However, here is the actual observed temperature changes:   The hot spot is completely missing, which is pretty much a knockout blow to the anthropogenic global warming theory. However, the correlation isnapos;t even there. See the below graph:   In case the graphapos;s methodology is questioned, consider this: “The Carboniferous Period and the Ordovician Period were the only geological periods during the Paleozoic Era when global temperatures were as low as they are today. To the consternation of global warming proponents, the Late Ordovician Period was also an Ice Age while at the same time CO2 concentrations then were nearly 12 times higher than today-- 4400 ppm. According to greenhouse theory, Earth should have been exceedingly hot. Instead, global temperatures were no warmer than today. Clearly, other factors besides atmospheric carbon influence earth temperatures and global warming.”[8] Surely these periods should have been warmer. Surely some other factor did not outweigh CO2 by that much. Even climate sensitivity cannot account for something as drastic as that. Further, CO2 concentrations have been much higher - as much as 7000 ppm in the Cambrian period. Iapos;m not going to argue that humans have not caused the CO2 increase, but it kind of shows how an increase of 100 ppm is rather insignificant. Even if the graph is analyzed, the correlation just isnapos;t there. Even so, again, CO2 seems to lag temperature changes anyway. As for humidity, it is, in fact, decreasing. “This shows that the actual water vapor content in the upper troposphere has declined by 13.7% (best fit line) from 1948 to 2012 at the 400 mb pressure level. The climate models predict that humidity will increase in the upper troposphere, but the data shows a large decrease; just where water vapor changes have the greatest effect on global temperatures.”[1] This graph shows this:   The two feedbacks, water vapor feedback and cloud feedback, are weak. The fact that humidity is decreasing negates the former. However, even if the humidity were increasing, more lower level clouds would form, which block sunlight from reaching the Earth, essentially negating the warming effect of the water vapor. Further, while higher numbers of cirrus clouds (which supposedly would increase in the scenario) cause warming, what has actually been found was that cirrus clouds were decreasing in number. “What we found in month-to-month fluctuations of the tropical climate system was a strongly negative feedback. As the tropical atmosphere warms, cirrus clouds decrease. That allows more infrared heat to escape from the atmosphere into outer space...quot;it would reduce estimates of future warming by over 75 percent.”[1][9][10] Finally, global warming is not happening unbelievably fast. “Temperature changes recorded in the GISP2 ice core ... show that the global warming experienced during the past century pales into insignificance when compared to the magnitude of profound climate reversals over the past 25,000 years. In addition, small temperature changes of up to a degree or so, similar to those observed in the 20th century record, occur persistently throughout the ancient climate record.”[1][11] This graph shows this:   It doesnapos;t look different than all the rest of the warmings. It even looks rather moderate. The Consensus The problem with any consensus argument, no matter how strong, is that science does not work by consensus. Michael Crichton has said, “Consensus is the business of politics. Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world. In science consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus.”[1] There have been many false consensuses in history. Heliocentrism, evolution, the big bang theory, continental drift, and even climate change itself used to be ridiculed by the majority of scientists. Thereapos;s no reason why this consensus should be believed above all of the other false ones. Even so, the consensus is based off of a misrepresentation of the data, and a selective look at studies. Over 31,000 scientists (with at least a Bachelorsapos; degree in relevant fields, and over 9000 PhDs) have signed a petition saying that global warming is not anthropogenic. “Only 41 out of the 11,944 published climate papers Cook examined explicitly stated that Man caused most of the warming since 1950. Cook himself had flagged just 64 papers as explicitly supporting that consensus, but 23 of the 64 had not in fact supported it. A book I own (but unfortunately donapos;t have access to at this moment) cites over 500 studies that donapos;t believe in the whole global warming edifice, showing various inconsistencies in the hockey stick graph (i.e. the 1500-year cycle), that the sun causes global warming, and that CO2 cannot be causing global warming, other things.[3][12][13][14] Conclusion There are many arguments against the anthropogenic global warming theory, and there are many problems with the assumptions it makes. The consensus is based off of a false understanding of how scientific hypotheses are supported, and isnapos;t even true anyway. Overall, the anthropogenic global warming theory does not hold water against its own assumptions and predictions. Sources Sources in comments.</t>

    <t>Thanks to subutai for posting an excellent opening round! Iapos;m looking forward to this debate, as I am sure it will be an interesting one!So to kick this thing off Iapos;d like to start by providing the readers with a quick road map of my case and how I aim to negate the given resolution.What I am going to do is set up the basis of a cause effect relationship between greenhouse gases (Such as CO2, Methane, and Water Vapor) and a warming trend, and then confirm this relationship with corroborating corollaries. This will prove that increased atmospheric GHG concentrations to create a warming effect on the climate.Next, I will begin to discuss why humanities effect on the climate creates an increased concentration of atmospheric greenhouse gases, thus creating an anthropogenic cause for global warming.Then, I will establish why the current warming trend cannot be due primarily to natural causes.Finally, to seal in these arguments, I will discuss the consensus of the scientific community as a whole regarding anthropogenic global warming.Conapos;s CaseI. The Greenhouse effect and Greenhouse GasesTo begin, letapos;s examine what exactly makes a green house gas, a green house gas. Everyone has likely heard of the most common GHGs: Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), and Water Vapor (H2O). Why, though, do these gases cause a warming effect, while the gases most prevalent in our atmosphere, Nitrogen and Oxygen, cause no warming? A) Di-pole momentExamine the following diagram describing the molecular structures of the gases above. So here we have CO2, Methane, Water Vapor, Nitrogen, and Oxygen in either 3d models, or Lewis structures. The thing we must pay closest attention to is their molecular shape (VSEPR Theory). Carbon Dioxide is bent. Methane is tetrahedral. H2O is Bent. Nitrogen and oxygen, however, are Linear diatomic molecules [1].Now, every element has a different level of electronegativity. In an atom with an electronegativity disparity, a dipole moment forms [2]. This is essentially the formation of a magnetic field direction. CO2 and H2O due to their bent asymmetrical shapes have Dipole moments. The dipole moment quot;pointsquot; from the more electronegative towards the less electronegative. More +--gt; LessWhen an atom is struck by particular wavelengths of infrared light, the bonds in the atom begin to quot;vibratequot; there are many kinds of vibration that can occur (bending, stretching, etc). [3] This causes the molecules to shift around, and in greenhouse gases, the dipole moment is shifted. Now atoms like N2 and O2 have no dipole moment, and no amount of shifting disrupts their symmetry. CO2 and H2O always have their dipole moment shifted by molecular vibration. Methane, due to the complexity of tetrahedral molecular shape, can undergo several vibrations that disrupt the symmetry of the molecule, and cause dipole moments to form.When a dipole moment is shifted or formed, much energy is released as heat. This is what happens in greenhouse gases [4].This is why greenhouse gases heat the earth when they are present in the atmosphere. Light from the sun strikes the molecule, and the infrared spectra that result in molecular vibration release heat energy into the atmosphere. Every single one of the billions of GHGs in the atmosphere are each acting as individual heat generators, catching and trapping energy from the sun, and heating the earth.B) Corollaries (Paleoclimate)Paleoclimates have historically been a major focal point of many debates on anthropogenic global warming. Therefore, I will preempt these arguments, so that time may be saved in the rebuttals. I will also reestablish the cause that I have described previously, and corroborate through corollaries.Many climate change skeptics have claimed that there is quot;No historic correlationquot; between the presence of green-house gases and global temperature. According to Royers 2006 [4] the data previously observed on the phanerzoic era has been contaminated, as it has not been adjusted for pH, which affects the molecular shape, atmospheric concentration, dipole moment, and molecular vibration potential of CO2. Quote Royer, quot;the temperature data correlate strongly with both the record of continental gla-ciation and atmospheric CO2quot;. Furthermore, the famous Vostok Ice Cores show that quot;there is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr.quot; [5]During the cenzoic period as well, CO2 was the driving force of Global warming, cite Hansen and Sato [6].II. Climate Sensitivity/CarbonAnother aspect of global warming that one must consider is quot;Climate sensitivity.quot; Climate sensitivity is essentially the amount of expected change in global temperature as a result of increased retention of radiation (via GHGs). [7] Essentially, climate sensitivity tells us how much the temperature will change, given a certain amount of CO2 concentration increase [8] [10]. The reason that certain paleoclimates were not nearly as warm given the increased concentration of CO2 was due to lower climate sensitivity [9].Current studies have established an accepted measurement of modern climate sensitivity (a range between 1-4.1 degrees Celsius per doubling of CO2). This number is accepted by both supporters and skeptics of global warming [11].Furthermore, to preempt a rebuttal on the presence of water vapor concentrations, it has been observed that global humidity is increasing [12] [13].A) Carbon Cycle, atmospheric CO2, and quot;Tipping the Potquot;A common rebuttal against the anthropogenic climate change case is the relative smallness of man-made CO2 compared to natural concentrations. The problem with this argument, is that it observes all carbon, rather than only atmospheric CO2. Carbon that is not in the atmosphere cannot affect climate change, and does not contribute to global warming. It can be seen that man-made CO2 almost always remains in the atmosphere, as the natural equilibrium of the earths carbon cycle is upset by the introduction of artificial CO2And now in the industrial age where CO2 is introduced into the atmosphere in a myriad of ways, we can see that atmospheric CO2 levels are at a record level.Then, as GHGs warm the Earth, positive feedback loops occur. Thus, humanity has quot;tipped the pot.quot;B) Positive FeedbackPositive feedback comes in many forms in climate change. The problem with global warming, is that said warming can result in the death of vegetation (due to droughts) and the warming of the ocean. Both of these further reduce the maximum absorption of the Earths carbon cycle, thus resulting in even more CO2 being released into the atmosphere. [14]These kinds of emissions are referred to as quot;indirect emissionsquot; as humans did not directly produce these GHG emissions, they are directly responsible for the factors that resulted in this emission. This emission also comes from other human practices, such as deforestation, and pollution of the ocean.III. What makes anthropogenic warming different from natural warming?The key difference between the current modern global warming, and previous eras of natural warming, is that the current warming period is undoubtedly the fastest in the Earthapos;s history. quot;Carbon dioxide and other global warming pollutants are collecting in the atmosphere like a thickening blanket, trapping the sunapos;s heat and causing the planet to warm up. Although local temperatures fluctuate naturally, over the past 50 years the average global temperature has increased at the fastest rate in recorded history.quot; The Global scientific community has reached a 97% consensus that the current trend cannot be accounted for by natural forces. 18 scientific associations have examined and produced data on the climate, and have stated quot;Observations throughout the world make it clear that climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are the primary driver.quot;[15][16][17][18][19][20][21]This is not an appeal to authority, as every single one of these quotes a backed by countless empirically verified, and peer reviewed studies. This is not a claim made by a single scientist, this is an overwhelming preponderance of evidence.A) Atmospheric Carbon Levels Atmospheric carbon levels, as previously mentioned, have never been this high. Record breaking levels of CO2 (a known GHG) have acted upon the Earth. Never before have atmospheric carbon levels been seen at this level. Natural CO2 cycles cannot account for this warming. Natural warming cycles of this Earth cannot account for how rapidly the earth is heating.IIII. Preponderance of evidenceThe evidence that suggest the reality of anthropogenic is, simply put, insurmountable. The weight of the evidence collected and scrutinized that points to the reality of anthropogenic global warming, when compared to the evidence presented against is like comparing the weight of a blue whale to the weight of a vole. Consider the following famous quot;Powell Charts.quot;Peer reviewed climatology articles 1991-2012Peer reviewed studies 2013This isnapos;t simply just scientists saying quot;I think anthropogenic global warming is real!quot;This is thousands of experts performing countless experiments, collecting endless data that they, as experts, have critically analyzed, and have found that the data demonstrates definitively that man-made global warming exists, and is the driving force behind climate change.SummaryThere is no room in the scientific community for climate change deniersSources in comments.</t>

    <t>Thanks to subutai for providing an interesting and educational case for me to analyze and rebut!RebuttalsDue to the loose structure of my opponents case, rebutting it proves difficult, as his contentions are not itemized. Nevertheless, I am going to itemize the case, and then attack each aspect of it.My opponents case, as I understand it, appears to be this:1. Solar activity increases deflection of cosmic rays2. Cosmic rays increase cloud cover3. Less cosmic rays means less cloud cover4. Less cloud cover results in temperature increase5. Solar activity is the main cause of modern global warming.The first, second and third premise is not at all confirmed by scientific evidence, nor is it agreed upon in the scientific community, unlike molecular vibrations.The fifth premise matters greatly, and I will rebut it with one main counter contention, which relies on one simple fact: my opponent provides precisely zero evidence that solar activity has been increased in recent years. Yes he may have shown that historically the solar cycles has had some influence on warming/cooling periods, but he totally fails to prove why this warming period is due to solar cycles.A) Solar Activity/Cycles cannot be responsible for modern global warming.-I. Though warming is occurring at record breaking rates, solar activity is at its lowest for the past 100 years.One major flaw we see in my opponents argument is that it is all based solely on the assumption that solar activity is currently increased, thus deflect cosmic rays, and resulting in warming. Yet this is not the case. Solar activity is actually at a 100 year low [1].Here we can see each and every quot;flarequot; cycle becoming weaker and weaker. Solar activity is declining. Rapidly. [2] We are even currently expecting a minimum similar to the maunder and Dalton minimums my opponent cited (periods of significant global cooling). How can solar activity possibly be the cause of modern global warming, if solar activity (the cause claimed by my opponent) is decreasing so quickly?!Furthermore, the very study my opponent claims to quot;end the debate right there,quot; the scafetta and west study, states explicitly quot;since 1975 global warming has occurred much faster than could reasonably be expected from the sun alone.quot; [3, page 4].The expected solar minima of 2006 [2] is now 8 years past, and yet the temperature continues to rise incredibly rapidly, with accelerating pace! My opponent cannot claim that the cooling has not yet occurred due to quot;latency cause by the oceans heat capacity.quot; If we expected cooling to occur within the next 5 years, the heating rate would be slowing, not increasing. The very graph that my opponent uses to seal in his argument referencing the medieval warming period is an outdated graph, debunked in the hockey stick controversy. Here is that same graph in red:Compare the IPCC 1990 (red) to the now corrected IPCC 2001 (blue) and Moberg et. al (black). The warming indicated by the graph my opponent was exaggerated as it was collected with flawed techniques pre-Kyoto protocol. Furthermore, the hatched green line shows modern warming trends, which easily blow these older warming periods out of the water in both rapidity and magnitude. Here is a even more detailed graph, compiled from from a preponderance of sources.(North et. al [4])We can still easily observe the medieval warming period, but with our data collection methods corrected, we can see that this warming period pales in comparison to the modern warming rates, with 2004 massively overshadowing the medieval warming period. Keep in mind, warming has only increased in rapidity since 2004.Benestadt and Schmidt show us that the sun could only have contributed to 7% (+/- 1%) of warming since 1950 [5].quot;A full reading of Tung 2008 finds a distinct 11 year solar signal in the global temperature record. However, this 11 year cycle is superimposed over the long term global warming trend. In fact, the authors go on to estimate climate sensitivity from their findings, calculate a value between 2.3 to 4.1°C. This confirms the IPCC estimate ofclimate sensitivity.quot; [8]quot;In the last 35 years of global warming, the sun has shown a slight cooling trend. Sun and climate have been going in opposite directions. In the past century, the Sun can explain some of the increase in global temperatures, but a relatively small amount.quot; [9]quot;Hypothetically, an increasing solar magnetic field could deflect galactic cosmic rays, which hypothetically seed low-level clouds, thus decreasing the Earthapos;s reflectivity and causing global warming. However, it turns out that none of these hypothetical are occurring in reality, and if cosmic rays were able to influence global temperatures, they would be having a cooling effect.quot; [10]In response to my opponents point regarding the warming of other planets, quot;There are three fundamental flaws in the apos;other planets are warmingapos; argument. Not all planets in the solar system are warming. The sun has shown no long term trend since 1950 and in fact has shown a slight cooling trend in recent decades. There are explanations for why other planets are warming.quot; [11]My opponent can come up with as many possibilities and theoreticals as he pleases, but the fact remains that actual scientific data flies in the face of every claim that he makes. When empiric data is observed, we see that solar activity is lowering while heating is increasing. We see that cosmic rays have no significant demonstrable effect on the environment. When we compare this to the Con case, we see that the evidence obviously weighs in the Cons favor. Molecular vibration and VSEPR theory are established scientific phenomena. The nature of GHGs is well understood. The scientific community has collected a massive preponderance of evidence.SummaryThe claim that the sun is causing global warming is patently false, as is shown by an overwhelming number of reliable and scientific sources. Solar activity is decreasing, and the planet is warming. The correllary between my opponents case, and the actual state of nature is in direct clash. My opponents case holds no water.-II. Attack on opponents sourcesAs I feel I have successfully rebutted all notions that solar activity could be the cause of modern global warming, I will now take a moment to analyze my opponents sources, and debase them. Letapos;s start with source 3. Here is a direct quote from my opponents third round 2 source quot;The IPCC stance with respect to the issue is a conservative one. While the panelapos;s 1990 report states that changes in the output of energy from the sun do have an effect on climate, as determined by the 11-year solar cycle, its most recent report states that the role of solar output remains uncertain. The panel simultaneously stresses the significance of increasing CO2 concentrations on climate, thus indicating that a great deal more needs to be learned about solar activity before it is considered as a major factor in forcing climate change.quot;Source 5: This comes from a forbes.com op/ed blog (a financial blog). The relevance of this source is obviously questionable. EVEN THEN as a skeptic he EXPLICITLY states that the impact of solar cycles is likely minimal. Quote, quot;We know the relevant effects exist in a lab, and are fairly certain they exist in nature, but we are uncertain how sensitive the actual climate is to these effects.quot;Source 6: This comes from a popsci article. Popsci is not a peer reviewed journal, and the author does not directly cite any authority, but upon reading the article, we again see that the emphasis is that there is a quot;possiblequot; link between solar cycles, cosmic rays, and cloud cover.Source 7, and 13: Watts Up With That is merely a blog notorious for spreading disinformation, and purposefully skewing data to debase the credibility of AGW scientists. quot;Willard Anthony Watts (Anthony Watts) is a blogger, weathercaster and non-scientist, paid AGW denier who runs the website wattsupwiththat.com. He does not have a university qualification and has no climate credentials other than being a radio weather announcer. His website is parodied and debunked at the website wottsupwiththat.com Watts is on the payroll of the Heartland Institute, which itself is funded by polluting industries.quot; [6] Watts isnapos;t even a certified meteorologist.Source 8: The Fred and Avery study, famous for being fueled by spending from, surprise, the Heartland Institute. quot;The existence of climate changes in the past is not news to the climate change scientific community; there is a whole chapter about it in the upcoming IPCC Scientific Assessment. Nor do past, natural variations in climate negate the global warming forecast. Most past climate changes, like the glacial interglacial cycle, can be explained based on changes in solar heating and greenhouse gases, but the warming in the last few decades cannot be explained without the impact of human-released greenhouse gases. Avery was very careful to crop his temperature plots at 1985, rather than show the data to 2005.quot; [7]Source 9, 11, 12: All blogs published by non-experts, without citation to legitimate reliable sources.SummaryThe whole of my opponents sources are questionable at best. The quot;factsquot; of his case hold no water, no reliability, and no authority. His case is simply unacceptable due to the illegitimacy of his sources. Sources in comments</t>

    <t>I would like to thank tylergraham95 for accepting this debate. I have decided to amend my debate structure a bit to fit the purpose of this debate. This round, I will post arguments for a natural cause. In the next round, I will post arguments against an anthropogenic cause. And in the final round, I will consider the most important material from both cases. The Sun The sun is the source for all the heat that the Earth receives. It is only natural to expect that fluctuations in the climate can be determined by the amount of solar activity. Unfortunately, the solar connection to climate Is not very well understood. However, there is a number of separate pieces of evidence, both direct and indirect, that indicate that the sun is the only cause of climate change on Earth. A graph of total solar irradiance is shown below:   [1] The low periods (the first one being the Maunder minimum and the second one being the Dalton minimum) correspond to documented colder periods in human history. In fact, the time of the Maunder minimum corresponded to the little ice age, when rivers that are normally ice-free froze and snow fields remained year-round at lower altitudes.[2] The correlation between solar activity and climate continued into the 20th century, and continues to this day. There are a number of methods to measure solar activity, the best one arguably being solar cycle length. Between raw solar activity (solar irradiance) and temperature, temperature lags about 7.5-10 years behind solar irradiance because of the heat capacity of the oceans. A better representation of the sun/temperature correlation is the length of the solar cycle. quot;This new parameter not only indicated a remarkably high correlation coefficient between solar activity and temperature (on the order of 0.95), but it also eliminated the problem of the 7-year lag encountered by Reid.quot;[3] Here is a graph showing solar cycle length against temperature:   [4] The correlation between the two is striking. There is obviously correlation. Like I said before, what is not well understood is the method of causation between the two. However, we can be certain that the sun has an obvious effect on the climate, and this is shown wonderfully above. The effect of solar activity is amplified through cosmic rays. Experiments have shown that cosmic rays increase cloud cover, that increased cloud cover lowers global temperature, and that solar activity reduces the amount of cosmic rays that strike the Earth. An experiment at CERN shows the first hypothesis: “Scientists found that when shielding was removed and natural cosmic rays allowed to hit the chamber, cloud seeding increased dramatically, and it increased substantially again when additional artificial cosmic rays were added.” Experiments in the atmosphere further confirm this: “Preliminary results show that these faux cosmic rays indeed have an effect on the atmosphere: When high energy protons stream in, production of nanometer-sized particles in the atmosphere increases by more than ten times.”[5][6] It is commonly accepted that greater amounts of clouds lower global temperature, because they block some of the solar radiation. Indeed, over the past couple of decades, cloud cover has decreased.[7] As for the final hypothesis that solar activity is correlated with cosmic rays, it is known that cosmic rays come from space, and that higher solar activity means that the sun has a stronger magnetic field, and that this stronger magnetic field deflects more of the cosmic rays reaching Earth. “Over the period between 1975 and 1989, he found cosmic rays decreased by 1.2 percent annually, amplifying the sunapos;s change in irradiance about four-fold.”[8] This graph shows both the inverse correlation between cosmic rays and low clouds and solar activity:   [9] The effect of solar activity on the climate can be partially explained by the role of ocean currents. “This [solar activity] is the single most important cause [of ocean currents and their temperatures]. The Sun provides the bulk of the energy which drives the circulation of water in the oceans, either directly or indirectly (through winds). The uneven distribution of solar energy across the globe (highest at the equator, decreasing towards the poles) produces an uneven heating of water in the ocean.”[12] The r^2 correlation between ocean current anomalies and temperature is 0.83, which is considered a good correlation, and considering ocean currentapos;s dependence on the solar cycle (which is rather similar to the 27-year solar cycle, I might add), this proves yet another piece of evidence linking solar activity with the climate.[13] Here is a graph showing ocean current anomalies compared with temperature:   [13] Another piece of evidence in favor of a solar cause to global warming is an analysis of other bodies in the solar system, for if the Earth is warming, shouldnapos;t the other bodies in the solar system also be warming? “In 2005 data from NASAapos;s Mars Global Surveyor and Odyssey missions revealed that the carbon dioxide quot;ice capsquot; near Marsapos;s south pole had been diminishing for three summers in a row. Habibullo Abdussamatov, head of space research at St. Petersburgapos;s Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory in Russia, says the Mars data is evidence that the current global warming on Earth is being caused by changes in the sun.”[10] This is not just an isolated incident. Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Io, Europa, Ganymede, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Trition, and Pluto have all shown signs that they are warming (if I have space in my round 4 argument, Iapos;ll elaborate on this).[11] “If the Scafetta and West analysis used the uncontaminated satellite data since 1980, the results would show that the Sun has contributed at least 75% of the global warming of the last century.” And this is just a minimum estimate. If this is true (which it seems like it is considering the arguments above), the debate has already been decided. The 1500-Year Cycle In addition to cycles of interglacials and ice ages, there seems to be a 1500-year climate cycle, where the climate goes from a period of warmer temperature, to a period of colder temperature, and back again to a period of warmer temperature, the entire process taking 1500 years to repeat. Where do these cycles come from? Thereapos;s no 1500 year solar cycle. However, there are 87 and 210 solar cycles, and superimposing the two cycles produces the 1500 year cycle.[14] This graph shows the most recent 1500-year cycle:   Many of the previous warmings (the Minoan warming, Roman warming, and Medieval warming), were as warm, if not warmer than the current climate. This, combined with the correlation evidence between solar activity and the climate, indicates that the current episode of global warming is nothing more than another cycle of the 1500-year cycle. There are numerous pieces of evidence for each of these warmings, as well as illustrations of the cycle. One such piece of evidence is, “The scientists found evidence that on average, every 1,470 years, plus or minus 500 years, cold, ice-bearing waters, which today circulate around southern Greenland, pushed as far south as Great Britain.”[8] There seems to be a full cycle of up-down-up temperatures of the climate every 1470 years. And this goes as far back as at least 1 million years ago. Currently, we are in an upswing of temperatures, just coming off of the Little Ice Age, the peak to be in a few hundred years, making the peak-to-peak difference between todayapos;s global warming and the Medieval Warm Period a little less than 1500 years. So todayapos;s Global Warming is a natural, cyclical occurrence. Conclusion Global warming is caused by an increase in solar activity. There is both correlation and causation between solar activity and global temperature. The sunapos;s effects on cosmic rays amplify the correlation, and the ocean currentapos;s cycles and correlation with temperature back up the idea. This hypothesis is backed up further by evidence that other bodies in the solar system are warming. The climate of the Earth fluctuates in 1500-year cycles, that correspond to a superposition of solar cycles. The Sun has been more active in the last 100 years than in the last 500, and this is exemplified in the fact that we are going through a warm period. Thereapos;s perfectly good reason to suppose that the current warming, similar to all the other previous warmings in magnitude and initial conditions (solar activity) was caused by the sun. In the next round, I will present arguments against an anthropogenic cause to global warming.

    <t>Thanks again to Subutai for allowing me to take on this challenge! Iapos;ve enjoyed the debate weapos;ve had throroughly.For this round, I will go through my opponents rebuttalls, and defend my case against them, and then make my closing statements.A) CO2 Lag in temperature changesSo the first problem we should address with this rebuttal is that it implies that I am trying to prove that GHGs are the driving force behind all forms of climate change. This is not the case. Climate shift, historically, has been/can be driven by several factors, usually multiple acting at once. What I can and have proven, though, is that CO2 and other GHGs have been a factor in the majority of climate shifts, historically, and that modern global warming can be explained only by the increase of atmospheric CO2 due to anthropogenic influences.So, letapos;s examine my opponents source number 2 for round 3. He attempts to demonstrate that CO2 increases have lagged warming, and therefore  CO2 cannot be the cause of modern warming. This is not so. In fact, the very source he cited (source 2 round 3 [1]) states that though the warming may have been initiated by another factor in climate shift, the sudden increase of CO2 from positive feedback amplified the warming effect massively.This is corroborated by cross-reference with my arguments regarding the phanerzoic era, and positive feedback loops in CO2 release. quot;When the Earth comes out of an ice age, the warming is not initiated by CO2 but by changes in the Earthapos;s orbit. The warming causes the oceans to release CO2. TheCO2 amplifies the warming and mixes through the atmosphere, spreading warming throughout the planet. So CO2 causes warming AND rising temperature causes CO2rise.  Overall, about 90% of the global warming occurs after the CO2 increase.quot; [2] quot;If you actually read the papers, which claim there to be a lag, they almost all note how CO2 acts as an amplifier and how the results do not contradict AGW. There is new research (Shakun et al.), which argued that CO2 preceded the end of the last ice age, and may have (in part) led to the warm interglacial in which we live today. The following graph from the study demonstrates how CO2 may have been an important factor in the most recent deglaciation:quot; [3] The truth is that sometimes small amounts of warming are intitiated, and then CO2 release into the atmosphere causes massive warming. This can be misconstrued to say that other forms of climate forcing could be present, but analysis of paleoclimate data, and the factors that are forcing the climate currently, it can be seen that Anthropogenic CO2 release can be the only explanatory factor of modern global warming, despite CO2 lag. [4][5][6][7][8]B) Troposphere climate data.The rebuttal to this argument is simple. The data my opponent cites is, simply, incorrect. quot;Satellite measurements do show warming in the Tropsphere when a cooling bias from the Stratosphere is removed. Warming trends agree well with surface temperatures and model predictions except near the Poles. Differences between various analyses are largely due to analysis techniques and compensations for satellite data issues.quot; [9]The data displayed, though not cited, by my opponent is based largely on Spencer and Christy 1992, which used collection methods that have since been significantly improved upon, and the modern satallite data collected shows us that the earth as a whole is indeed warming. [10] C) South Pole is cooling.Again, this is a false leap my opponent is begging you to make. He claims that ice is increasing in the south pole, and then states that it is therefore cooling. Cooling is not indicitive of increased ice formation. That is simply not true. The southern ocean has recorded to be warming. [11]The increase in ice anomaly is due only to a complex mixture of changing currents (brought on by global warming) and the hole in the ozone layer. [12][13]D) CO2 is saturatedThis argument is fairly weak, as the myth that CO2 saturation can occur has been debunked. The opposite has been conclusively proven with empiric evidence. The idea that CO2 saturation can occur is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the way that the greenhouse effect occurs. quot;This argument originates from Angstromapos;s work in 1901. We now know that the planetary energy balance is determined by the upper levels of the troposphere and that the saturation of the absorption at the central frequency does not preclude the possibility to absorb more energy.quot; [14]The argument that my opponent is making is ancient (over 100 years old) and has since been debunked, as the modern atmospheric warming model now accounts for the simple force of convection. Essentially, this argues that the CO2 is in the atmosphere to absorb extra heat from the sun and heat the Earth. That is not how a greenhouse works, or how the greenhouse effect occurs. When a greenhouse is heated, the glass then keeps the hot air from escaping, which causes warming. The same goes for CO2. The earth is heated, and then releases this energy in the form of black body radiation. Increased CO2 concentrations prevents this radiation from escaping at the proper rate.E) Troposphere hot-spotThis counterpoint my opponent has made is going to follow the pattern that his counter-case has followed thus far. His case is based on data that has been collected incorrectly, and proven to have been collected incorrectly. Essentially, my opponent (through no fault of his own) is citing data and sources that are patently false, and lend no water to his case.quot;Satellite measurements match model results apart from in the tropics. There isuncertainty with the tropic data due to how various teams correct for satellite drift. The U.S. Climate Change Science Program conclude the discrepancy is most likely due to data errors.quot; [15] Improved data collection has shown that the data cited by my opponent was mired with error, and that improved data collection methods demonstrate a hotspot. [16][17][18]The quot;Consensusquot;My opponent, for whatever reason, decides to attack the recent media reports on the quot;scientific consensusquot; on AGW. I never cited a consensus, rather I only cited thousands of empiric studies with empiric evidence in support of AGW, and asked the voters to weigh these sources against the one single report published in conflict with AGW. A concensus is apparent though, but it I do not argue that the science is clear because there is a consensus. I argue that there is a concensus because the science is clear. By my opponents line of logic, we ought to deny scientific consensus due to the rare occasion where a consensus is totally false, but this is not proper logic. The truth is when a consensus is reached in the sceintific community (post scientific revolution/enlightenment era) that the consensus is right nearly 99.999% of the time! No we shouldnapos;t accept something as the absolute and gospel truth just because there is a consensus, but in the face of overwhelming data and testimony from experts, versus sparse data from a splinter group of deniers, the only logical and reasonable belief to side with is that of the overwhelming evidence and expertise.Therefore, you must vote CON!Sources in comments</t>

    <t>Just going to do a quick line by line.  quot; Without technology, mankind would still be considered as animals trapped on a planet, unarmed and unfit to fight for survival and unable to complete even the simplest tasks. Therefore, technology brings more good than harm.quot;  There is literally 200,000 years of human existence and survival happened just fine before anything youapos;d consider technology even existed. Humans can survive on very little as evidenced by are ancestors doing it for at least 180,000 years.  quot;Even though mankind uses technology for some disadvantages, technology must and can be used to surpass all conflicts between one another, maintain peace throughout the globe, as the essential tool for survival, help all living creatures in the state of evolution, and teaches us the true meaning of hopequot;  On the contrary. Technology has made conflict easier. We can send planes across the globe to kill enemies we wouldnapos;t even have if it werenapos;t for us being so interconnected because of technology.  When you consider that because the world is so connected diseases like Ebola can spread across the globe faster and easier, meaning a plague could more easily destroy the worl, we have enough nukes where if we were to go to war with another nuclear powered country we could end all life on Earth.  Technology isnapos;t our savior. It is in fact enslaving us like my last round showed and may even be the thing that wipes humanity of the face of the Earth.  quot;inescapable in our lives and has proved essential to mankind. Therefore, it is conclusive that humans and animals needs technologyquot;  Thatapos;s irrelevant to the resolution. The question posed is quot;does it do more harm than Goodquot;, which it most certainly does not quot;Is it essential for survivalquot;, which is debatable.  quot;Your first point ,which stated global warming was caused by technology, is in fact a probability, not conclusive. Even if technology caused the occurrence of global warming, global warming can be overcome by technology  I gave evidence to support that conclusion and youapos;ve merely asserted itapos;s not true instead of addressing my arguments. My arguments stand and I extend them.  quot;One day, our societies will replace everything that pollutes to things that doesnapos;t, from cars that runs by petrol to cars that runs by solar energy, from burning fossils to generating wing energy and many other.quot;  speculation, nothing to support these beliefs. This is just a bare assertion at itapos;s finest. The trend is more pollution and global warming and I see no evidence of those trends stopping. Even so, without technology to start with global warming wouldnapos;t be a problem.  I gave evidence for how autonomy was destroyed under my section entitled quot;harm to humansquot;. Iapos;ve shown billions of animals tortured and bad drinking water. The best pro does is show how these things can be mitigated with technology but these things are harmful no matter what</t>

    <t>Thank you for your participation in this debate.  As I have mentioned earlier, I have stated that technology is crucial to the survival of all living creatures. Technology is inescapable in our lives and has proved essential to mankind. Therefore, it is conclusive that humans and animals needs technology. Next, I will point out the faults in your points.  Your first point ,which stated global warming was caused by technology, is in fact a probability, not conclusive. Even if technology caused the occurrence of global warming, global warming can be overcome by technology. How so? Well, technology has changed when it began entering the new era of clean and sufficient energy. As we all know, scientists of today have invented solar panels and wind turbines, that supplies us clean energies, which doesnapos;t pollutes. One day, our societies will replace everything that pollutes to things that doesnapos;t, from cars that runs by petrol to cars that runs by solar energy, from burning fossils to generating wing energy and many other.  Besides that, you stated that many people does not have access to safe drinking water, but do you know thatapos;s a company in Switzerland invented a water filter, called the LifeStraw. It is an excellent example that technology can overcome any problems and make it better. http://en.wikipedia.org...  Other than that, it is normal for humans to have farm animals as they are food to us. As your point, you said that animals were treated badly. However, little did you know, there are also animal sanctuaries and forest reserves to protect them in their natural habitats. For example, http://woodstocksanctuary.org.... When technology gets better, our civilizations stays in a stable position resulting mankind to be capable of compassion. That way, we get to do more than just survive, weapos;ll be able to help others in survival, and maybe more.  Moreover, technology will never control us as technology is a part of us ever since the dawn of mankind. We earn our living with technology as our stepping stone for success and use technology to maintain peace and order. Without technology, there will be chaos and our society will never be suitable for our future generations to grow in.  Lastly, there are no evidence referring that the loss of the human autonomy was actually caused by the superior rise of technology. In fact, there are no relation between these two things. The information you gave merely explain the definition of autonomy, not how these two things relate.  In conclusion, technology can and will bring us more good than harm, and bring us hope rather than chaos.</t>

    <t>Harms caused by technology-  Damages to the environment.   A. Technology is the main factor behind global warming.

Autonomy is an innate human desire that isnapos;t going away despite the fact the more the technological beast grows the more us humans lose our autonomy.  [1] http://m.psychologytoday.com...

    <t>Technology, is used around the globe, from the invention of wheels to the futuristic Google glasses. To indicate whether technology does more harm or more good, I will list out points on why technology does more good than harm.  First of all, technology can bring us one step forward towards a much better future. Technology is created ever since the existence of mankind during the prehistoric times to ease mankind in completing any difficult tasks and to expand the horizon of the impossible. Most importantly, technology is used in many ways, such as to bring mankind into deep space, discover new resources, create new cures for various diseases, and many more. Without technology, mankind would still be considered as animals trapped on a planet, unarmed and unfit to fight for survival and unable to complete even the simplest tasks. Therefore, technology brings more good than harm.  Other than that, technology is needed for survival. Mammals, such as West African chimpanzees and Brazilian capuchin monkeys, uses technology in the form of stone hammers and anvils to crack nuts for food. Besides that, beavers make dams and bees make honeycombs. These are examples of the importance of technology. Without technology, survival is a challenge for both mankind and animals. Therefore, technology is essential for survival.  Even though mankind uses technology for some disadvantages, technology must and can be used to surpass all conflicts between one another, maintain peace throughout the globe, as the essential tool for survival, help all living creatures in the state of evolution, and teaches us the true meaning of hope...</t>

    <t>Thank you Mikal, Bluesteel, and 16kadam. I want to establish, first, that this isnapos;t a debate about Global Warming, but about Man-Made Global Warming. To prove his case, Pro must establish that Man-Made Global Warming is the threat. If he establishes that Global Warming is a threat, but can not establish that enough of it is man-made to say the threat comes from man, he can not affirm the resolution.Contention 1: Human caused Global Warming Exists.  Many Global Warming advocates state that CO2 levels are skyrocketing, but that is incorrect. I give you the above graph measuring the past 600 million years of CO2 levels, which shows we are actually at an all time low. Now the website I got this from no longer has this page up so I apologize. We can see from observance of this graph that, with us being at an all time CO2 lows, that we are nowhere close to meeting the impact that my opponent brings up. The world has had CO2 levels over 5,000 ppm, while are now currently around apprx. 350 ppm CO2 levels.  The above graph shows that comparisons of C13 (Carbon isotope) and this shows that there is little to no trend in many of these as the average is zero while the trend for all of these are zero (1). This is important as the Carbon isotope is important in measuring this so called quot;Global Warming.quot;  This chart above shows the CO2 and Earthapos;s temperatures for the past 600 million years. My opponentapos;s claims are incorrect as we have had absurd levels of CO2 and let the Global Temperature never reached the extreme levels needed to prove causation on the level Pro must prove (2). Now I will move on to how Earth is actually cooling and how itapos;s temperature is cooler than it has been.If we observe the above graph we can see that Earth has been a whole lot hotter than where we currently are to the point where the Earthapos;s average temperature is been 7.5 °C hotter than it currently it is. You can also see that in the span of the past 10,000 years the temperature has leveled off, but you may ask yourself where does that place us in the lights of modern day?  I am going to cite Dr. Done Easterbrook, who is a climate scientist. Back in 2000 he predicted that Earth was entering a cooling phase. He predicts that for the next 20 years Earth will cool by 3/10 degree each year and that we are going to enter another little Ice Age like we did from 1650 and 1790 (3). While the IPCC, the people Pro quoted, has been wrong since just before the 2000’s, while the Earth has cooled, as Dr. Done predicted.1) http://tinyurl.com...2) http://tinyurl.com...3) http://tinyurl.com... Contention 2: Future Harm and sea levels. Many Warming Scientists claim that the sea level rise is due to the Arctic melting, but this is false. Al Gore stated that the Arctic Ice would be completely melted by 2014, but he is incorrect then and now.  Jan. 6, 2012: The Coast Guard Cutter Healy breaks ice around the Russian-flagged tanker Renda 250 miles south of Nome. The Healy is the Coast Guard’s only currently operating polar icebreaker. The vessels are transiting through ice up to five-feet thick in this area. The 370-foot tanker Renda will have to go through more than 300 miles of sea ice to get to Nome, a city of about 3,500 people on the western Alaska coastline that did not get its last pre-winter fuel delivery because of a massive storm (4). Letapos;s go back to 2007-2008 and see if his claim was justified in the Arctic Ice activity.  It seems that he is incorrect, but letapos;s look further into the near past. How about 2012-2013? (5) We all remember the Climate Scientists that got stuck in Arctic Ice Earlier this year correct? Then a Russian Ice Breaker tried to free them, but got stuck. Can you guess what they were studying? They had predicted that all the Arctic Ice had melted due to Global Warming and that Earth would get flooded massively. Boy were they wrong (6).  (7) Dr. Koonin, former head of the Department of Energy under President Obama, has stated that Global Warming is not certain. This is because he has found 3 things wrong and highly incorrect about the theory. 1. Shrinking of Arctic Sea ice doesnapos;t account for the gaining of the Antarctic ice. 2. Earthapos;s temperature today is the same as it was 30 years ago. 3. The sea levels rose at the same height and rate in the 20th century. (8) Here is another correlation that must happen. If the Ice Caps are completely melted as Pro claims then the sea level would have risen completely drowning tons of land.  The graph above is raw satellite image data of the sea level rise over an 8 year period showing that there is little to no change in the Sea Levels rising (9). The sea level rises, on average, about 3 inches per century and it has been found to not even been rising at all.  This graph is the sea levels off the cost of French Guyana which is one of the areas which is predicted to be flooded due to Global Warming, but as you can see by the graph (which goes to 2008) the sea level is currently on a downward trend (10).

Contention 3 - The Benefits of a Warm Climate A moderately warm period is better than a cold period. If the temperature is not too warm, a warm climate can have positive effects on both the Earth as a whole and on everyone. A. Health Effects In moderation, warm temperatures are better for the body than cold temperatures. People cannot get enough heat, infections are rampant, and hospital admissions will rise in the cold. From 1979 to 1997, extreme cold killed roughly twice as many Americans as heat waves [coincidentally when the Earth was heating up]. In Germany, heat waves were found to reduce overall mortality rates slightly, while cold spells led to a significant increase in deaths. In addition, warmer weather decreases incidences of strokes, respiratory diseases, and the flu.[1] In general, life expectancies are higher in warmer climates, and there are fewer incidences of disease and other health problems. A warm period would be beneficial to human health. B. Economic Benefits Some of the major industrial sectors, particularly agriculture, tend to work better in a warmer environment than they do in a cooler environment. quot;The book [The Impact of Climate Change] finds that a moderate warming will have a positive economic impact on the agriculture and forestry sectors. Since carbon dioxide is used by plants to capture and store energy, there may be a fertilizing effect as levels of the gas rise. This, combined with longer growing seasons, fewer frosts and more precipitation, among other factors, could benefit some economic sectors.quot;[2] CO2 increases, a byproduct of temperature increases ([1]), naturally help to stimulate plant growth as well, further helping agriculture. quot;For a 300 ppm increase in the atmosphereapos;s CO2 concentration above the planetapos;s current base level of slightly less than 400 ppm, for example, the productivity of earthapos;s herbaceous plants rises by something on the order of 30%, while the productivity of its woody plants rises by something on the order of 50%.quot;[3][4] This further helps humans by increasing food yields, lowering rates of starvation and hunger. 1) Singer, S. Fred, and Dennis T. Avery: quot;Unstoppable Global Warming: Every 1,500 Years.quot; 2) http://www.sepp.org...3) http://www.geocraft.com... 4) http://www.sciencemag.org... Contention 3 - The Effects of CO2 Even if Pro were to establish that Global Warming is a threat, he must establish that humans cause a substantial deal of Global Warming before they can establish that Man-made Global Warming is a threat. The main case that Global Warming activists have to prove Man-Made Global Warming is a large part of the picture is the CO2 argument. it doesn’t, however, stand to fact. Carbon Dioxide is, in fact, very weak. Having only a Global Warming Potential of 1. Carbon Dioxide makes up a grand total of 3.618% of the total Gas House Effect, with water vapor making up 95% (1). Carbon Dioxideapos;s number increased from 295 ppm to 400 ppm, an increase of 105 ppm, equal to 49.29 gigatons (1 Gigaton of CO2 is worth 2.13 ppm (2)). Since 1 gigaton of CO2 is worth 0.004% of total Greenhouse Effect, 49.29 gigatons is worth an additional 0.21% (2). We can see the weakness of CO2 in the chart below. If humanapos;s did raise CO2 levels by 105 ppm, the effect on the climate would be pathetic. People gravely exaggerate the effect of CO2 on the climate. The chart of Global Warming gases is as follows: GAS -- GREENHOUSE EFFECT -- HUMAN EFFECT Water Vapor ------ 95.000% -- 0.001% Carbon Dioxide -- 3.618% ---- 0.117% Methane ------------ 0.360 ------ 0.066% Nitrous oxide ----- 0.950% ---- 0.047% Misc ------------------- 0.072% ---- 0.047% Total ------------------ 100% ------- 0.278% Following the graph, we can assume correctly that human’s CO2 emissions add very little, if almost anything at all, to Global Warming. If the man-made portion of Global Warming (0.21% of the total) was a threat, than we’d been dead from the natural Global Warming (99.79% of total) long ago. At 0.21%, the rise in temperature from our contribution would be so small that the difference in temperature from Spring to Summer would be greater.1) http://www.geocraft.com...2) http://cdiac.ornl.gov...</t>

  <pair id="462" entailment="ENTAILMENT" task="IE">
    <t>== Framework ==  For something to be a threat, there only needs to be a reasonable probability that it can cause harm in the future. In contrast, to show that a threat to the environment does not exist, our opponent’s must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there is no possibility that human-caused climate change can cause harm in the future. Our opponent’s burden comes, in part, from the precautionary principle, which holds that we should not take any actions that fundamentally alter our ecosystem (such as emitting large amounts of CO2) unless we are absolutely certain that there will not be problematic consequences to doing so in the long-term. The justification for the precautionary principle is that environmental harm is irreversible and the long-term effects are hard to predict, so we should be extremely certain that our actions will not cause harm before fundamentally altering our ecosystem.  == Case ==  Contention 1: Human-caused global warming exists  The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is an international group of some of the world’s most respected scientists. The IPCC has published five different reports on climate change. With each subsequent generation of report, the reports get more accurate because more datasets become available.  First, warming is happening now. According to the IPCC’s fifth report on climate change: quot;Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and oceans have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen, and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased.quot; [IPCC 5, http://www.ipcc.ch...]  quot;It is virtually certain that globally the troposphere has warmed since the mid-20th century.quot; [IPCC 5] The IPCC defines quot;virtually certainquot; as having a 99-100% confidence level. [IPCC 5] The IPCC also says it is virtually certain that we will have more hots days and fewer cold days over major land areas in the future. [IPCC 5] The IPCC says that it is virtually certain that increased cyclone activity is caused by global warming. [IPCC 5] quot;It is virtually certain that the upper ocean (0-700 m) warmed from 1971 to 2010.quot; [IPCC 5] The IPCC says that it is virtually certain that permafrost levels will continue to decline due to global warming. [IPCC 5] quot;It is virtually certain that global mean sea level rise will continue beyond 2100quot; due to global warming. [IPCC 5] The IPCC report also contains numerous findings that are quot;very likelyquot; (90-100% confidence level), but for the sake of saving space, we wonapos;t excerpt them here.  Second, recent warming is caused by human activity. quot;The evidence for human influence has grown since [the previous IPCC report]. It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.quot; [IPCC 5] quot;Extremely likelyquot; is a 95-100% confidence interval. [IPCC 5] Today’s atmospheric CO2 levels are 40 percent higher than the highest natural level of CO2 that has ever existed in the last 800,000 years. [EDF, http://www.edf.org...] We know that most of the increase in CO2 levels is due to burning coal and gasoline because the composition of the CO2 has a unique fingerprint that allows scientists to determine its source. [EDF] Another human activity that has increased CO2 levels is the massive clear cutting of the rainforests, which formerly acted as a huge carbon sink, absorbing large amounts of CO2. [EDF] Deforestation adds 1,500,000,000,000,000 grams of carbon to the atmosphere each year. [GCP, http://www.globalcarbonproject.org...] Thus, humans contribute greatly to global warming.  The data proving that human-caused global warming exists has become so overwhelming that it has converted former climate skeptics, such as University of California, Berkeley, professor Richard Muller. Muller writes: “quot;Call me a converted skeptic. Three years ago I identified problems in previous climate studies that, in my mind, threw doubt on the very existence of global warming. Last year, following an intensive research effort involving a dozen scientists, I concluded that global warming was real and that the prior estimates of the rate of warming were correct. I’m now going a step further: Humans are almost entirely the cause. [New data from UC Berkeley] show[s] that the average temperature of the earth’s land has risen by two and a half degrees Fahrenheit over the past 250 years, including an increase of one and a half degrees over the most recent 50 years. Moreover, it appears likely that essentially all of this increase results from the human emission of greenhouse gases. [The UC Berkeley data set is] stronger than those of [previous IPCC reports].quot; [NYT, http://www.nytimes.com...]   Third, there is significant evidence in the paleoclimatic record that greenhouse gasses have a significant effect on the global temperature. Over the Cenozoic Era, which began about 66 million years ago, we can see a clear greenhouse induced warming effect within the various warming and cooling cycles. It remains very clear that CO2 remains the main driver of climate in this period. The large climate changes over the period cannot result from shifts in the climate system, but depend on both energy coming into the planet (e.g. solar rays) and changes in the atmosphere (greenhouse gasses). The sun, however, cannot be considered the dominant force of climate change in this time period because the luminosity increased by about 0.4% over this period. That alone cannot explain the warming during the Cenozoic because the Cenozoic has also seen a period of decreasing temperatures, which could only be explained by fluctuating CO2 levels (from 1000 ppm at the beginning of the Cenozoic to a low of 170 ppm). If the sun was responsible for the warming during this period, we’d see only a constant increase in temperatures. Continental movement also is unlikely as an explanation for the observed climate change during this period due to the fact that “most continents were near their present latitudes at the beginning of the Cenozoic.” Studies have concluded that “CO2 was the dominant climate forcing in the Cenozoic” [Hansen amp; Sato, http://www.columbia.edu...]   Contention 2: Future harm from global warming  By 2100, global warming is estimated to cause 1.9 trillion per year in economic damages to the United States. [NRDC, http://www.nrdc.org...] The damage includes 360 billion from destroyed real estate due to rising sea levels, 141 billion in higher energy costs due to higher demand for air conditioning, 950 billion due to the cost of providing water to places where it dries up, and 422 billion in damages from the increase in tropical storms due to global warming. [NRDC]  Future sea level rise, even by conservative estimates, are significant and would threaten “some coastal cities and low-lying island nations.” The low estimates--assuming less than 2 degrees celsius warming and a decreased temperature trend after 1950--find that there will be about half a meter sea level rise by the year 2100. [Horton et al., http://www.sciencedirect.com...]   Food production, important to the well being of society, also represents a large industry: about 200 billion a year to the US economy. Agriculture is dependent upon certain climatic conditions and altering these could prove to be catastrophic. While an initial increase in temperature may help some crops, once temperatures pass the crop’s optimal levels for growth and reproduction, increased warming becomes counterproductive. [EPA, http://www.epa.gov...] Some crops, like grains, grow faster when the climate is warmer, but because these crops grow faster, they have less time to fully mature, so they produce fewer edible byproducts. [EPA] Further, weeds thrive in warmer climates with more CO2 enrichments. Farmers already spend 11 billion a year combating weeds. Future temperature increases would add another burden to the industry [EPA]. Lastly, climate change dries out and acidifies soil, further impacting food production. [IPCC 4, https://www.ipcc-wg2.gov...]   Many theoretical models exist claiming that certain diseases would become more common as the climate changes. For example, increased temperatures will allow the virus that causes dengue fever to survive in more places. In 1990, 30% of the world’s population lived in regions where the estimated risk of dengue fever transmission was 50%. By 2085, 5-6 billion people (about half of the future estimated population) would live in areas where they were at risk of dengue transmission. If climate changes do not occur, only 35% of the population would be at risk. [Hales et al., http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...]   Conclusion As you can see from our prior contentions, man made global warming is in fact a threat and can cause a great deal of harm. Even if Con casts some doubt on the harm caused by global warming, as long as we win that some harm is probable, we win this debate. Almost any amount of harm is enough for you as the judge to affirm the resolution that global warming is a threat. For the Con team to win this debate they must negate all of our contentions and statistics along with building a case of their own showing that there is in fact no threat from global warming. We can clearly see from the prior contentions that there is indeed a threat and it can and will cause harm.</t>

    <t>I apologize to all - Lannan wrote the first two contentions in the last argument, but he can’t present refutations this round due to time conflictions. I (Subutai) will do my best to address Mikal’s concerns, but I will take liberties in presenting arguments that will deviate from what Lannan wrote. I also only have about an hour left, so I also apologize if anything looks sloppy. Contention 1 - Anthropogenic Global Warming There seems to be some disagreement between the different people writing the different arguments. I am simply going to show three reasons why an anthropogenic cause is unlikely. First, according to the greenhouse effect, global warming should be starting from the lower atmosphere and moved to the surface (because the CO2 collects in the upper troposphere first). However, this is not happening. quot;...satellite and high-altitude balloon data confirm that the lower atmosphere is not trapping lots of additional heat due to higher CO2 concentrations. It is hard to know how fast the Earthapos;s highly variable surface is warming, but it is warming faster than the lower atmosphere where the CO2 is accumulating. This is strong evidence that CO2 is not the primary climate factor.quot;[1] Here is a graph showing how the surface has warmed more than the troposphere:   Second, current levels of CO2 have very little effect on temperature. The greenhouse effect certainly exists, but it doesnapos;t become linearly stronger with increasing amounts of CO2. CO2apos;s effect on temperature is logarithmic, meaning that each additional increase has a smaller effect on the climate than the last. quot;The carbon that is already up in the atmosphere absorbs most of the light it can. CO2 only soaks up its favorite wavelengths of light and itapos;s close to its saturation point. It manages to grab a bit more light from wavelengths that are close to its favorite bands but it canapos;t do much more, because there are not many left-over photons at the right wavelengths.quot;[2][3] This chart shows approximately the effect that each additional increment of CO2 increase has on temperature:   Note how the pre-industrial to modern level increase has had less than a 0.2 C increase in temperature. Third and most importantly, the predicted quot;hot-spotquot; 10 miles above the tropics that would be a signature of CO2-induced global warming is absent. quot;The computer models show that greenhouse warming will cause a hot-spot at an altitude between 8 and 12 km over the tropics between 30 N and 30 S. The temperature at this hot-spot is projected to increase at a rate of two to three times faster than at the surface. However, the Hadley Centreapos;s real-world plot of radiosonde temperature observations shown below does not show the projected CO2 induced global warming hot-spot at all. The predicted hot-spot is entirely absent from the observational record. This shows that atmosphere warming theory programmed into climate models are wrong.quot;[2] Here is the plot of predicted temperature changes due to CO2:  However, here is the actual observed temperature changes:    The hot spot is completely missing, which is pretty much a knockout blow to the anthropogenic global warming theory. And to be fair to Easterbrook, the IPCC isn’t very good at predicting the climate either: The climate seems to have a mind of its own that we haven’t deciphered yet. However, it looks very unlikely that anthropogenic causes are behind the recent global warming. [1]: Singer, S. Fred, and Dennis T. Avery: Unstoppable Global Warming: Every 1,500 Years [2]: http://tinyurl.com... [3]: http://tinyurl.com... Contention 2 - Sea Level Rise Even though some groups like to show scenes of global apocalypse with this, the truth is that the sea level hasn’t risen that much. However, both past and predicted rise have been greatly exaggerated. The linear trend shows a sea level rise of only 1.31 +/- 0.30 mm/year. quot;The Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory estimates the rate of sea level rise at 1.42 plus or minus 0.14 mm/year for the period 1954 to 2003. This is less than the estimate of 1.91 plus or minus 0.14 mm/year for the period 1902 to 1953, indicating a slowing of the rate.quot; That’s an increase of around 2.8 inches in the last 50 years – not that much of an apocalyptic scenario.[1][2]  Future sea level predictions are even better. As of currently, global ocean heat content has not changed in recent years. Sea level itself has actually been declining for the last decade.    “The ‘INQUA Commission on Sea-Level Change and Coastal Evolution’ led by Dr. Morner, prepared as estimate that the global sea level will rise 10 cm plus or minus 10 cm in the next 100 years. Dr. Morner has since revised his estimate to 5 cm per 100 years after considering data of the Sun activity suggesting that the warming trend may have ended and the Earth may be headed into a cooling trend.” That’s around 2.5 inches in the next 100 years. That’s really not too bad.[2][3] As for Tuvalu, sea level has actually dropped four inches in the last 20 years and there is no evidence based on the observations that sea level rise there is accelerating.[4] In general, there is no cause for concern here.

Contention 3 - Benefits of Global Warming If we take the rest of our argument (take, for example, global warming), we see that the potential threats of global warming are only exaggerated, if not unimportant. This contention is built upon the previous arguments.  A - Health Benefits If the flu is correlated to heat, then why is the flu worse during the winter months? In fact, the virus dies quicker in warmer weather than colder weather. The Plague of Justinian was partially caused by a colder climate.[1] As for deaths from heat and cold, quot;The only global study suggests that this is true internationally: by 2050, there will be almost 400,000 more heat-related deaths a year, and almost 1.8 million fewer cold-related deaths. Warmer temperatures will save 1.4 million lives each year. The number of saved lives will outweigh the increase in heat-related deaths until at least 2200.quot;[2] Yes, while it is easier to make fire than an air conditioner, heat is, overall, better for the body than cold (to a point). People in the Middle East are healthier (when controlled, that is) than people in, say, Siberia. What my opponent cites is not an increase in deaths from warming per se, but in temperature variability: quot;The claim that warming increases morbidity rates is a myth. This isnapos;t the case, according to Dr. Robert Mendelsohn, an environmental economist from Yale University. Mendelsohn argues that heat-stress deaths are caused by temperature variability and not warming. Those deaths grow in number not as climates warm but as the variability in climate increases.quot;[3]  B - Economic Benefits There’s no reason, beyond the most apocalyptic of models that the warming would be so bad that plants would be severely affected beyond what they can handle. Plus, you never responded to my claim that CO2 helps crops. [1]: http://tinyurl.com... [2]: http://tinyurl.com... [3]: http://tinyurl.com...  Contention IV: The Effects of CO2. Pro is playing with words here. The idea of a threat isn’t that it’s kinda not okay, but that it is in fact an issue. A paper cut isn’t a threat, but a knife cut to the artery is. Pro must establish that Man-Made Global Warming is an actual issue that could harm0 us, not that it’s just not good. As for the term Man-Made Global Warming, it refers to the topic as it is or is likely to become. Not what it would be in an unlikely scenario. If human’s contribution to Global Warming, as it is or might be, isn’t large enough to justify being called a threat, than Pro has not affirmed the Resolution. Regarding CO2 causing temperatures to rise enough to cause enough evaporation… This is an extreme case of slippery slope. It gravely assumes CO2 will cause that kind of increase in Water Vapor. Water Vapor is very weak. The increase in tempature needed to give Water Vapor the quantity to affirm the resolution is nearly unreachable.I’ve already established how weak CO2 is. It would take unimaginable amounts of it to cause such an increase in Global Warming. Pro’s argument is so often quoted, but it’s simply improbable. Unless Pro can establish that Man-Made CO2 has enough of an effect to start that cycle, he can’t prove such a slippery slope. Another flaw in Pro’s argument is that it’s ignorant of historic records. Let’s look at history... CO2 ppm is at 400 right now, but in the Mesozoic period and Cambrian Perios, it reached 2000-4000 and 7000 ppm.(5) At 7000 ppm, the temperatures were only 10ºc higher than today. Proportionately, temperatures should have been 54.23ºc higher than now. This empathizes how little of an impact CO2 has on the global temperature.  With how weak CO2 is, it would take insane quantities to accomplish what Pro claims it will. But even at 7000 ppm, it was unable to increase the temperature enough to support Pro’s case, especially if water evaporation was enough to escalate it. More evidence of the weakness of CO2 can be found in the current Global Warming Cycle. Pro shows a CO2 chart of the past 10,000 years... Here is a chart of the CO2 levels and Global Warming level from the past 400,000 years.  As we can see, despite the abnormal CO2 presence, temperatures today are actually the lowest in the past 400k years of Global Warming cycles, which are common and completely natural. Despite Pro’s claim, CO2 simply does not have the necessary effects. It may follow warmer temperatures, but warming temperatures do not follow it. When temperatures rise, CO2 rises, but when we see CO2 rise, temperatures don’t rise with it. Historically, and even now, CO2 does not bring forth the effects needed to prove it has a substantial effect on warming. Or that it’s effect is large enough to cause temperatures to rise enough to increase Water Vapor. 5) http://tinyurl.com...(GCA).pdf</t>

  <pair id="465" entailment="ENTAILMENT" task="IE">
    <t>R1) Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) ExistsRight from the start we can see a lot of errors from Con’s opening arguments and graphs. The first thing we want to note is that Con’s first graph about atmospheric CO2 levels is extremely misleading. Although Con doesn’t source it, Con’s graph comes from a study by Robert Berner. There are HUGE uncertainties in Berner’s guesses as to what CO2 levels were hundreds of millions of years ago. You can see in the chart below that the range of error is huge . [http://tinyurl.com...]  Also Berner himself said that the “exact values of CO2 [in his report] should not be taken literally.” [SkS1, http://tinyurl.com...]  Berner’s guess-work therefore cannot be cited as the actual values for CO2 levels in the past.  Second, the sun was so much dimmer hundreds of millions of years ago that higher CO2 levels were needed just to prevent the Earth from freezing over. (During this period, the sun “would have been several percent dimmer according to established nuclear models of main sequence stars . . .  with a dimmer sun, high CO2 is necessary to stop the Earth freezing over.”) [SkS1] Berner even said, compensating for all the factors that were different in the past, “over the long term there is indeed a correlation between CO2 and paleotemperature” [Berner and Zavareth 2001, http://tinyurl.com...].  Third, you can see that over the past 10,000 years, CO2 levels today are at an all time high. CO2 has risen exponentially since the start of the industrial revolution.  [http://tinyurl.com...]   Unlike over a time scale of millions of years, the luminosity of the sun has been relatively constant over the last 10,000 years, so the only factor that has changed has been CO2 levels. Therefore, the only factor that can explain the temperature increase over the last 10,000 years is CO2. Fourth, Con is blatantly wrong. The greenhouse effect is obviously a real effect that is acknowledged by every scientist in the world. When you walk into a hot car or an actual greenhouse, it has heated up so quickly because of the CO2 in the car or greenhouse. It is impossible to assert that CO2 levels have *no* effect on temperature. The following chart shows the correlation between CO2 and temperature over the last 500 million years. The dotted line is CO2 and temperature is the solid line. The study also concludes that if you look at the luminosity of the sun alone, without accounting for CO2 levels, luminosity alone *fails* to explain temperature fluctuations.  [http://tinyurl.com...] Our opponents next cite Don Easterbrook, who predicts a cooling in the near future. However, his predictions have been outrageously incorrect for the first 10 years of its data. [SkS3, http://tinyurl.com...]. The following graph depicts Easterbrook’s failed predictions:[SkS3]   You can see from the graph that temperatures have actually increased, not declined as Eastberbook predicted.  Further, although Easterbrook portrays the IPCC’s prediction of the temperatures since 2000 as incorrect, the IPCC actually got the story much closer to reality than Easterbrook. When confronted as to where Easterbrook obtained the IPCC data, he claimed he got it from the website, but that they had deleted it. The data he portrays shows future temperature predictions based on greenhouse gasses alone, which is not the actual IPCC data from the IPCC reports (which included natural factors as well). In other words, Easterbrook’s model has failed to predict what has occurred and his refutations of IPCC findings refutes a dataset that the IPCC never even used in their report because it is not a complete picture of the causes of warming.  [SkS4, http://tinyurl.com...]. R2) Sea levels and ice levels  Con says that Al Gore said all the ice would be gone by now. We never cited Al Gore and there are a lot of unscientific things said in his documentary. Who cares what he said, Al Gore is not a scientist nor a viable source.  Con drops the IPCC study that says ice levels will continue to decline in the future.  Con also says that some Coast Guard boat is also seeing ice up north. We have never said there is zero ice anymore. Con is just straw-manning.  Third, Con cites some sketchy tabloid-esque picture of the northern ice sheet. Taking 2 photos a year apart does not prove anything. You need to look at averages. If you take a photo on a bad day in 2012 and a really good day for the ice sheet in 2013, it might look like the ice sheet is increasing, but you have to look at annual average size, not the size on a particular date. It’s the same problem with saying “it’s cold outside today, so there’s no global warming.” If you measure global temperature on one day in 2012 and on one day in 2013 and say, “see the temperature has gone down,” that’s not proof that global temperatures are falling. Again, we need to look at yearly averages, not snapshots of a single day.  Here is the *average* amount of ice in the ice sheet over time; it’s declining (because it’s melting).    http://tinyurl.com...   Next, Con cites Dr. Koonin, who didn’t say global warming doesn’t exist, but merely that climate models are uncertain. Something can still be a threat, even if the models are not accurate to 100% certainty.  Con also notes that temperatures have not risen dramatically over the last 30 years. This is due to a series of El Nino events that have pushed some hot water from the surface into the deep ocean. [NOAA, http://tinyurl.com...] This effect will not continue forever; we just got lucky that ocean circulation shifts managed to shift some heat into the deep oceans. IPCC climate models that predict an increase in temperature of 2 degrees in the future account for these El Nino events.  Con also says that sea levels have not been rising any faster than in the past. However, sea levels have been rising *twice* as fast over the last 20 years than they did in the preceding 80 years. [Nat Geo, http://tinyurl.com...] Con looks at an 8 year period and says the rate isn’t increasing, but the only reason that would be relevant is if the rate of CO2 emissions was a lot higher at the end of the 8 year period than at the beginning. If the amount of CO2 emitted by humans per year stayed relatively constant over this period, you wouldn’t expect sea levels to start rising any faster. Also, Con is merely cherry picking an 8 year period that looks favorable to them. If you look at trends over a broader time scale (100 years), the rate of increase has gone up.  Con then merely straw mans our argument and says that if polar ice caps had *completely* melted already (something we never claimed), then French Guyana would be underwater. We never made this claim. We only said that some island nations, like Kiribati, have thus far been swallowed by the sea. [http://tinyurl.com...]  R3) Global warming is, on balance, good  First, Con can’t outweigh a threat. Nukes are a threat. On balance, mutually assured destruction may be beneficial to global peace, but nukes are still a “threat” to the United States. Even if something has some good effects, it can still be a threat.  Second, Con’s points don’t outweigh the harms of global warming.  (A) Health Effects  Con claims that overall health would be positively impacted by higher temperatures. However, they don’t link their source (they cite a book, but don’t provide a link or a page number). There’s no scientific explanation for why strokes or respiratory disease would decline with warmer temperatures. Research has also shown that the severity of the flu virus would *increase* (not decrease) as temperatures warmed. Warmer winters lead to more severe flu outbreaks--which, by definition, means a warming climate would make flu epidemics more widespread and harmful [ASU, http://tinyurl.com...].  Con also claims that “extreme cold” has killed more people than heat waves. However, “extreme cold” refers to people who have died in blizzards or while backpacking. If you don’t prepare for the cold when you go outside, you’re going to die. In contrast, people don’t die in their houses because it’s too cold; they can always throw on more blankets. People without air conditioning, however, do die from heat waves. A 2003 heatwave in Europe killed 35,000 people (mostly elderly). [http://tinyurl.com...]  On balance, “increases in heat-related deaths due to climate change would outweigh decreases in deaths from cold-snaps.” [EPA, http://tinyurl.com...].  (B) Economic Effects Con never proves that the benefits to crop outweighs the 1.9 trillion per year the US will lose due to global warming. Also, we already refuted these arguments last round. Con says that a “moderate” increase in temperatures benefits crops, but there’s no proof the increase will stay moderate and once it becomes too severe, crops are severely harmed. In addition, while crops grow faster in warmer climates, they grow too fast, leaving less time to mature, so they produce fewer edible byproducts.   R4) Effects of CO2First, Con says we have prove that human-caused warming is a “substantial” part of warming, but we don’t have to prove it’s a substantial threat, just a threat, so this is *not* something we have to prove. The degree of danger from the threat can make it *more* of a threat, but a threat is still a threat. Second, CO2 has a cascade effect. When CO2 causes temperature to increase a little bit, that causes more evaporation from the oceans which leads to more water vapor in the atmosphere. So even if water vapor has the largest effect on global warming, CO2 emissions cause more water vapor to be released into the air, which is called a positive feedback loop [SkS2, http://tinyurl.com...] (“The amplifying effect of water vapor has been observed in empirical studies such as Soden 2001”). Third, Con is conceding the greenhouse effect exists in this contention, which destroys their first contention, where they are trying to deny that the greenhouse effect is even a real phenomenon.</t>
    <h>GLOBAL WARMING: A Team Debate.</h>
  </pair>
  <pair id="467" entailment="ENTAILMENT" task="IE">
    <t>We are not going to make new arguments, and keep it to a summary.  Weapos;ve proven that global warming will cause massive amounts of economic harms, and a large increase in the death toll. The magnitude of the impacts are so large, even if we only prove a small probability of human-caused warming, we win that it is a quot;threat.quot; The same is true of nuclear war: it is a threat because the magnitude of its impacts is so large, even if the probability of it happening is small. C1Our opponents argue that tropospheric warming is minimal and that no hotspot exists. This is incorrect. Our opponent’s first graph shows no error bars. With no source along with the graph, it is impossible to properly fact check it--we don’t know if the author of the graph is legitimate--however, we provide references with all the graphics we use, most of which coming from peer-reviewed articles. The study which proposes a lot of the anti-tropospheric warming argumentation (Douglass et al) has multiple problems with it. When errors are corrected and error bars added, models correctly replicate tropospheric warming. [RC, http://www.realclimate.org...] Further, research by climate skeptic John Christy eviscerates the supposed discrepancy between surface temperatures and tropospheric temperatures which the CON team brings up. When measurement error in radiosonde and satellite data are corrected, the discrepancy is erased. Only small discrepancies exist near the tropics in radiosonde data, however most researchers think the difference is due to still unknown “instrument errors” [SkS, http://www.skepticalscience.com...]. Two hotspot graphs used by CON are based upon radiosonde data. These graphs attempt to show the tropospheric hot spot does not exist. However there is no discrepancy between predictions and observable measurements except in the tropics--these graphs use these locations. However, the stations in the tropics are spread out and too few in number to provide a realistic picture as to what is going on with the climate. Overall, these results should be taken with a grain of salt. When these issues are accounted for, tropospheric hotspots are found to exist [RC, http://www.realclimate.org...].  [RC]  As can be seen, there are very few radiosonde positions in the tropics.   Our opponents claim CO2 is logarithmic to temperature. We agree with this and are well versed with this piece of information. Our opponent’s graph demonstrates the effect of CO2 (with no feedbacks) is about 1 degree C of warming per doubling of CO2 (from pre industrial levels). This is accepted by both sides of the aisle. If feedbacks are included, the effect of CO2 doubling is likely 3 degrees C. The logarithmic effect also means that every doubling of CO2 will have about the same forcing (eg, 100 to 200 ppm 3 degrees, 200 to 400 another 3, etc). Again, the logarithmic effect is accepted by everyone in the field of science--the question is again, the effect of feedbacks, something our opponents have not mentioned.  CON also argues the IPCC has failed to predict temperatures. However, this is incorrect. Using an average of GISS, NASA, NOAA, NCDC, and the HADCRUT4 surface temperatures, the IPCC has accurately predicted temperatures over the period of 1990 - 2012. The IPCC predicted 0.2 degrees C warming per decade, which is well within the margin of error for actual temperatures (0.15 degrees C per decade, +/- 0.08) [SkS, http://www.skepticalscience.com...].   [SkS]  C2   Our opponents paint a very optimistic picture in relation to sea level rise. An extensive study in 2008, using measurements from satellites, has found that the rate of sea level rise has actually  increased from 1870 - 2006. The reason for a small reduction in sea levels--which our opponents cite--are likely from the volcanic eruptions from the 1960s - 90s, which caused cooling. However, when these eruptions ceased, sea levels again rose. In fact, “the rate of rise over the five most recent 20-year periods is 25% greater than the next largest set of values during the 1940s” [Church et al. http://academics.eckerd.edu...].    Our opponent’s study used more regionalized stations to measure sea level. The graph claiming no increase in heat content is based on the NODC study Levitus et al. HOWEVER, our opponents graph ONLY resembles the graph using depths of up to 700 meters. And even then, there is a significant increase in heat content increase not reported in CON’s graph. Using global ocean heat content, the rate continues to increase and does not “flatten”. Our opponents source (likely from the skeptic blogosphere) misrepresents the actual findings of the study [NOAA, http://www.nodc.noaa.gov...].   Tuvalu is regional, not global, and therefore is not relevant to this debate. Simply because sea level is falling in one area does not mean the global average will display the same characteristics.    C3 (a)Health Benefits  Our opponent cites our source but misrepresents its content. The flu worsens with warming temperatures because the warmer it is, the less flu there is on a certain season. However, the following season sees a dramatic outbreak of the flu significantly worse than in previous years due to the fact that 1) fewer people catch the disease and 2) threat perception decreases. And with a perception of threat low, fewer vaccinate, and therefore there is more disease in the long term.   To argue deaths from cold snaps override deaths from heatwaves is untrue. The EPA, as previously cited, was using data from a large review of the literature published by cambridge. To counter… you cite an op-ed. Now, that does not mean you are inherently incorrect, but the literature has already refuted that hypothesis. A recent publication has found that “[w]hile global tem­per­a­ture is indeed increasing, so too is the vari­ability in tem­per­a­ture extremes”. They also found, “this means that even as overall tem­per­a­tures rise, we may still con­tinue to expe­ri­ence extreme cold snaps” [SD, http://www.sciencedaily.com...]. In other words, not only will people die from heat waves, but cold snaps will still exist and will still cause substantial harm, negating the premise of Lomborg’s op-ed. The World Health Organization also disagrees, arguing the effect to human health will be catastrophic. In one large heat wave in Europe, “more than 70,000 excess deaths were recorded” [WHO, http://www.who.int...].   Our opponents have also ignored our argument on Dengue fever and other tropical illnesses. The dengue fever used to be only a tropical disease, but climate change has caused it to be much more widespread. Further, malaria and other infectious diseases are destined to kill more people as the climate warms [Wiki, http://en.wikipedia.org...].(b) Economic effects  Our opponents claim we never responded to their position on crops. This is incorrect. We did in all of our rounds. We demonstrated a harm to the farming economy, and the fact that more CO2 = faster maturing plants, which = fewer plant yields. The NRC has looked at the literature, and finds that if the world warms 3 degrees C, crop yields will fall dramatically. If it increases, 2 degrees, there will still be a decrease. And if it increases 1 degree (this is with no feedbacks), there will be a decrease in yields except in mid latitude areas. Overall, the effect will be negative [Wiki, http://en.wikipedia.org...].     [Wiki; NRC]  C4  To claim that water vapor is weak is contradictory to previous claims you have made, which argue water vapor is the primary greenhouse gas. Without feedbacks, the doubling of CO2 will increase temperatures by 1 degree celsius. This is not “insignificant”, and is enough to begin the positive feedback loop. Empiricals studies have demonstrated this effect, and climate sensitivity is generally considered about 3 degrees C per doubling of CO2 [Held, http://maths.ucd.ie...].    Further, our opponent’s math is incorrect. It takes about 5 co2 doublings from the pre-industrial period to reach 7000 ppm. This, with sensitivity and the logarithmic effect accounted for, would lead to 15 degrees C of warming, not 54 degrees. This is within the margin of error, meaning the examples presented do not disprove the relationship between CO2 and temperature. Further, the temperature was closer to +15 degrees, not +10 like CON argues. In the Cambrian, there is no real accurate picture of what temperatures were like, due to the fact it was so long ago. Further, these calculations fail to account for the position of the continents or the sun, which also affect climate. Where the landmass was in the cretaceous is “may have had a radiative effect equivalent to +1 CO2 doubling” [Royer, personal correspondence]. This means that to get an accurate picture of the climate, we have to account for other factors. In fact, recent research has demonstrated this, and finds that the climate sensitivity to CO2 is at least 3 degrees C [Royer 2014, http://droyer.web.wesleyan.edu...]. The fact is, a look into history supports AGW theory, it does not weaken it.   Again, a graph which does not show much at all. It does not account for other factors which may be stunting warming (e.g. aerosols). The IPCC has looked into the evidence within this time frame, and finds that “it is very likely that glacial-interglacial CO2 variations have strongly amplifed climate variations” [IPCC, https://www.ipcc.ch...].</t>

  <pair id="470" entailment="NONENTAILMENT" task="IE">
    <t>Contention 1: No Major/any CO2 Increase.      Many Global Warming advocates state that CO2 levels are skyrocketing, but that is incorrect. I give you the above graph measuring the past 600 million years of CO2 levels are we are actually at an all time low. Now the website I got this from no longer has this page up so I appologize. We can see from observance of this graph that we being at all time CO2 low levles that we are nowhere close to meeting the impact that my opponent brings up. We have been over 5,000 ppm of CO2 in our atmosphere and are now currently around apprx. 350 ppm CO2 levels.  The above graph shows that comparisions of C13 (Carbon isotope) and this shows that there is little to no trend pertrade in many of these as the average is zero while the trend for all of these are zero. (http://www.drroyspencer.com...) This is important as the Carbon isotope is important in measuring this so called quot;Global Warming.quot;  This chart above shows the CO2 and Earthapos;s temperatures for the past 600 million years. My opponentapos;s claims are incorect as we have had aburd levels of CO2 and temperature on Earth and may I ask how did we survive that? (http://www.sustainableoregon.com...)  Now I will move on to how Earth is actually cooling and how itapos;s temperature is cooler than it has been. Contention 2: Earth is cooling.  If we observe the above graph we can see that Earth has been a whole lot hotter than where we currently are to the point where the Earthapos;s average temperature has been 7.5 degrees Celcuis hotter than it currently it is. You can also see that in the span of the past 10,000 years the temperature has leveld off, but you may ask yourself where does that place us in the lights of modern day?  I am going to site Dr. Done Easterbrook, who is a climate scientist. Back in 2000 he predicted that Earth was entering a cooling phase. He predicts that for the next 20 years Earth will cool by 3/10 degree each year and that we are going to enter another little Ice Age like we did from 1650 and 1790. (http://www.cnsnews.com...)  The funny thing is that many of my opponentapos;s charts are actually from the incorrect IPPC. How about the quot;Hockey Stickquot; graph that many Global Warming supporters , including my opponent, argue about? Well if we observe the fallowing chart taken from Northern Scandenavia we can see that the Global trend over the past 1,000 years that the Global Cooling trend slope is that of -0.31 Degrees Celcuis, give or take 0.03 degrees (for the error room). Professor Dr. Jan Esper has found that the Earthapos;s temperature of Earth actually decreases 0.3 per millenia due to the Earth moving away from the sun. (http://newsbusters.org...)   Here is another graph from 1920 to 2005 and we can see that the graph has a negative temperature slope, thus meaning that the Earth is under a period of cooling. (http://blog.chron.com...)  Contention 3: Artic Ice. First, I would like to state that Proapos;s claim about the North Pole completely melting is bogus. Al Gore stated that the Artic Ice would be completely melted by 2014, but he is incorrect then and now.  Jan. 6, 2012: The Coast Guard Cutter Healy breaks ice around the Russian-flagged tanker Renda 250 miles south of Nome. The Healy is the Coast Guard’s only currently operating polar icebreaker. The vessels are transiting through ice up to five-feet thick in this area. The 370-foot tanker Renda will have to go through more than 300 miles of sea ice to get to Nome, a city of about 3,500 people on the western Alaska coastline that did not get its last pre-winter fuel delivery because of a massive storm. (http://www.thegatewaypundit.com...)  Letapos;s go back to 2007-2008 and see if his claim was justified in the Artic Ice activity.  Hmmm... It seems that he is incorrect, but letapos;s look further into the near past. How about 2012-2013? (http://ginacobb.typepad.com...)  We all remember the Climate Scientists that got stuck in Arctic Ice Earlier this year correct? Then a Russian Ice Breaker tried to free them, but got stuck. Can you guess what they were studying? They had predicted that all the Arctic Ice had melted due to Global Warming and that Earth would get flooded massively. Boy were they wrong. (http://www.nytimes.com...)   (http://www.americasfreedomfighters.com...)  How about Al Gore. The man who brought Global Warming to our attention? In 2009, the man breaks down in tears stating how itapos;s nothing, but hot air and how he fabricated everything just for the money! He said the arctic sheets are not melting and CO2 is not responsible for depletion of the Ozone. (http://www.thomaspeep.com...) Dr. Koonin, former head of the Department of Energy under President Obama, has stated that the Global Warming scare is not suttle. This is because that he has found 3 things wrong and highly incorrect about the scare. 1. Shrinking of Artic Sea ice doesnapos;t acount for the gaining of the Antartic ice. 2. The warming of Earthapos;s temps today is the same as it was 30 years ago. 3. The sea levels rose at the same height and rate in the 20th cenury. (http://www.newsmax.com...)  Contention 4: Sea Levels  Here is another corralation that must happen. If the Ice Caps are completely melted as Pro claims then the sea level would have risen completely drowning tons of land.  The graph above is raw satellite image data of the sea level rise over an 8 year period showing that there is little to no change in the Sea Levels rising. (http://joannenova.com.au...) The sea level rises, on average, about 3 inches per century and it has been found to not even been rising at all.  This graph is the sea levels off the cost of French Guyana which is one of the areas which is predicted to be flooded due to Global Warming, but as you can see by the graph (which goes to 2008) the sea level is currently on a downward trend.(http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org...) The source is the PDF within the link.Contention 5: The Weather My opponent is claiming that Hurricanes are increasing due to Global Warming, but this claim is indeed false! The hurricanes since the year 1900 to 2008 have actually been decreasing. The slope of this downward slope is .0016. Though it is small the hurricanes are still in a downward trend.As a matter of fact not only are Hurricanes on a downward trend, but they are at an all time low as in the year 2010, there was only 68 Hurricanes Globally, which is an all time low in the past 40 years. (http://wattsupwiththat.com......) How about Tornados you may ask? In the graph above you can see that tornados are at an all time low in the past 60 years! (http://wattsupwiththat.com...)  But what about Hurricanes?Here is a graph showing the number of days between hurricanes and this shows that the number of days between hurricanes is greatest at 76 days between hurricanes.The slope of this line is zero showing no trend of a massive storm increase.Now I must end my argument here before I run out of my characters.

    <t>First of all I want to touch on your rebuttal that carbon levels have not increased drastically over the course of earths existence. Although it is true that earth had much more carbon dioxide several million years ago this was counteracted by massive amounts of plant life that photosynthesized to create the air you breath today and the oil you put in your car. thus the massive amount of Co2 drops that range from super volcano explosions from Yosemite national park or other cataclysmic events that caused the death of millions of plants and thus a spike in Co2 levels. It would be nice to imagine that this is natural but it is not. For as you see in his very first graph Co2 levels are going up at a faster rate than any other time period besides the late Cambrian period. Yet this increase is not due to any natural cataclysmic but instead a self made increase in Co2 which has increased by a factor of five in a mere 200 years. This time zone is a speck in your million year graph but is increasing at a exponential rate and has yet to slow. I would also like to answer your rhetorical question that you posed on how we survived suchquot;absurd levels of Co2 and temperature on Earthquot; and the fact is we didnapos;t have to because the Co2 fluctuation that you are describing happened hundreds of millions of years in the past were the earth would have not been able to support human life as we know it. http://www.epa.gov... In your third graph you once again use data from hundreds of millions of years ago to set a standard for earths temperature. The two temperature shifts happened for very different reasons one being asteroid induced Apocalypse and the current Co2 increase due to human activity.  In relation to your arguments that global temperature readings are going down NASA would beg to differ as they have recorded a gradual increase in temperature http://climate.nasa.gov...  I am also curious when you are saying my opponents graphs or I disagree with both Al Gore and the IPCC on their global warming estimates but you continue to use a straw man argument and putting words in my mouth that I never said.  I also have problems with your hockey stick graph which does not have its y axis labeled and the line of best fit that was drawn on the graph after that because it is not accurate to NASA climate readings and thus I can only assume are based on land based climate measurement stations that can be quoted by both believers and skeptics of global warming due to their chronic irritability.  You have also miss quoted my statement on arctic ice which i did not say was melting but rather I said that the ozone layer is weakening above it. Although this hole is slowly repairing itself it is still weak to fluctuation and thus we are very lucky that it is repairing itself after decades of damage by CFCapos;s.Scientists also have no clue as to why arctic ice is thickening and do not know how long it will last. Thus I o not believe that the melting of arctic ice will lead to a increase in sea level know due to the still unexplained thickening of arctic ice but if we do not do something this unexplained blessing may revert back to its original melting stage that will cause cities like New York and Boston to be more susceptible to flooding.  In relation to your data on storms I miss wrote my opinion for you are correct that their have currently been less storms than in the past. However, the storms that do get created have been far more devastating and have shown up in places that almost never receive a hurricane the most prominent example being New York and even further back hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. Tornadoes have become less common due to reasons that scientists do not understand because we still do not fully understand how tornado are created.  I also noticed how you left out my argument on droughts due to the definitive proof that the number of droughts have increased around the world from the Midwest to India these drought swill only get worse and slowly rising temperatures will only exasperate the problem  Finally I would ask that you research your graphs a little bit more for the Co2 graphs you found that spanned millions of years had almost nothing to do with global warming as well as not discounting a phenomena just because the scientific community does not fully understand it.

    <t>Firstly Iapos;d like to point out that Co2 is not CO2, because Co is the element symbol for Cobalt not Carbon Dioxide. Please be careful. My opponent argues stating that the graphs of millions of years ago doesnapos;t matter, but it does, because if the harms of Global Warming that my opponent says are true then we currently wouldnapos;t be here, because as I have showed Earth has had CO2 levels and Global Temperatures way higher then we currently do. This shows that my opponentapos;s case has no impact to it. Then he goes on to say that thereapos;s a spike in levels due to oil and such, but if you remember the chart that I have given you in my last round you can see that it has a negative slope with means that Earth is actually cooling. In my 4th Graph you can see that the IPPC is incorrect in there readings of Global Warming and that we are currently cooling and heading into another Little Ice Age.  As for you EPA souce, I have already pre-refuted that in my last round with my hockey stick chart evidence showing that we have a negative slope in terms of the Global Temperature showing that we are cooling and not warming.  My opponent drops my second graph showing that though we have had a major increase in the burning of focil fuels that it has had no effect on the atmosphere. My Hockey stick Chart, if you click on the link that I had provided you, is from the Johannes Guttenburg University where the scienctists there conducted a study and that was their evidence. This study was conducted in the Artic Lattitudes and, you would think that if Global Warming exists that it would have an upward slope, but it has a down ward slope.  Last Decade the US has passed the Kyoto Protocol which banned the Production of CFCapos;s from first world nationapos;s, but will have no real impact due to it excluding countries like China and India. You can see in terms of more Warming in the evidence in which Scientists use Ice Cores Earth has actually been Cooling the past Mellenium.  You can see that in terms of Gasses contribution to the Green House Effect the major contributer is Water Vapor and itapos;s at 95% to CO2apos;s 3.6% and this is the overall contribution including man made and natural. When we look to the chart on the left we can see that Man-Made CO2 does have a higher contribution to the atmosphere than Water Vapor, but thatapos;s because we do not create much water vapor as humans. Even with this evidence we can see that CO2 does not have any effect what-so-ever compared to Water Vapor. (http://www.geocraft.com...) Where might those CFCs be on this graph you may ask. Why itapos;s under the Misc. gases section. Though the world has been in a drought for hundreds of years the techonology has been picking up with new agricultural techonolgies like GMOs and factory farming.</t>

    <t>First of all sorry for the CO2 typo spellchecker loves to hate on me  I am also a bit annoyed that you have misconstrued my point on the first few graphs you used which had a measurement of earths greenhouse gas levels over millions of years. To be clear these CO2 spikes happened due to mass extinctions that left a majority of plant life dead on the earth. Thus unless you are implying that massive amounts of plant life is dying the current spike of CO2 is man made. http://www.climatecentral.org...  And in relation to your graphs that earth is heading towards a cooing era the measurements used to take them were provably ground based temperature readers that tend to vary widely. For NASAapos;s reading of global temperatures has read a stead increase in global temperature by a total of 1 degree Fahrenheithttp://climate.nasa.gov....  Though that fact may no seem scary that mere temperature change has huge ecological and weather ramifications. And if this trend continues and earths CO2 emission only increases than this temperature shift will increase at a quickening pace.  In relation to the hockey stick graph I looked into what the graph actually meant seeing as their was not labeling o the axis but what it does show is a 0.3 temperature drop per millennium. In the last 20 years the earth has had temperature increase of 1 degree Fahrenheit. Thus their is no way that the earth progressively moving away from the sun will effectively counteract climate change.  Also the effects of CFCapos;s are very different than traditional greenhouse gases for this dangerous gas, for lack of a better term, eats up ozone and is largely responsible for the hole in the ozone layer that has slowly developed over the arctic circle. Thus it is a completely different and much more dangerous greenhouse gas than CO2 and Methane.  In relation to your graphs on overall greenhouse gas contribution I have not seen repeated in ever source I looked at with the average impact of Humans on global warming to be between 3 and 5 percent. Although this may not seem scary this small percentage change is several billion tons of CO2 that affect the rates of the greenhouse effective and over time( and iapos;m talking about hundreds of years) will lead to exponential temperature growth. Right now it is linear but will only level out if mankind as a whole reduce carbon emissions or find some way to create balance between our CO2 creation and capturing. To see some of these solutions I recommend you watch the Nova special on global warming.</t>

    <t>You see as the human population increases the number extintions for different animals also increase due to our need for resources and the human population is growing and when the resources are used up we move on like a paracite. Extintion rates have been increasing because of this. (http://www.pbs.org...) You have provided one graph while I have provided several that say the same thing done by different sources and not NASA and the EPA which can be bias to your case. (If you wish to debate on the EPA we could do so when this debate is finished) Itapos;s the steadiness in the graph that makes me question the validity of the information while mine so both increases and decreases.  You have looked up the hockey stick graph, but I have shown that in my graphs that the hockey stick graph does not exist and that it is unlikely that the Earth is warming at all as I have shown in several graphs that the Earthapos;s temperature is decreasing. I have shown that it is cooling and that the IPPC is incorrect on their Warming Predictions.  My opponent now brings up one theory relying on the Ozone hole, but this is incorrect as the World Health Organization (WHO) has found that the Ozone is actually getting thicker and is expected to make a great recovery by 2025 due to the banning of Hydrocarbons. (http://www.express.co.uk...)   My opponent attempts to refute the last graph that I had provided in my last round, but even though we are dumping large amounts of CO2, methane, and CFCs into the atmosphere they are contributing little to Global Warming. The graph shows how much it contributes not the quanitity and it shows that Water Vapor by far is more superior than that of CO2, Methane, and CFCs combined!</t>

    <t>Firstly Iapos;m confused by your first graph which has nothing to do with the topic of global warming  I also donapos;t think you understand my points on your graphs. Your graphs on temperature are either based on ice core temperatures which is imprecise when used as a measure of temperature especially over short periods of time which is what global warming demands as in order to study. Or your measurements are based on terrestrial based temperature readers which have been use by both anti global warming and anti global warming pundits because they are so chronically unreliable. The NASA measurements are the closest possible reliable source of information because they are taken from space which gives the the most complete view of the planet.  On the quot;theoryquot; that the ozone layer has developed hole above the arctic circle is not a theory because it has happened. And the hypothesis that the WHO presented does not account for CFCapos;s that are being made in china and India  And in relation to the fact that water account for the greenhouse effect than other greenhouse gases is correct however I believe you are underestimating how much greenhouse gases is composed of three percent of all greenhouse gases (the percentage that is man made). For this 3% accounts for several billions of tons of greenhouse gas such as CO2 and methane that humans are putting in the atmosphere. This increase upsets the natural equilibrium of the greenhouse effect and in time will lead to an exponential increase in temperatures. over 97% of scientists agree with this theory and distrust of general scientific theory is only harmful to the continued existence of mankind.</t>

As for satellite readings I give you the second and 5th chart from Round 2. These both are satellite imagings and they both show the same thing. That CO2 levels do not affect the atmosphere Much like the 2nd graph in Round 3 we can see that CO2 and even man-made at that matter has no affect and doesnapos;t contribute to Global Warming as Water Vapor does. It also shows that the IPPC is incorrect and many of the NASA scientists are in the IPPC and this actually discredits their sourcing. The Ozonen hole is above the Antartic, not the artic. The graph does include the CFCs from third world nations. As for the CO2 gasses contributing, I know that there are billions of tons, but it still doesnapos;t contibute to the Greenhouse effect even comparably close to Water Vapor. This shows that there is no corrilation between Warming and CO2.  Now as for those 97% of scientists that my opponent was talking about.

    <t>Thank you, opponent, for giving me a chance to debate with you. I hope this can be an enjoyable experience for the both of us.Arguments:1. Less people die.My opponent correctly suggests that, in recent years, children and infants have died less frequently from disease. This is due to great advances in medicine. However, those great advances in medicine have also brought other, much less desirable, effects.Thalidomide:Thalidomide was first sold in Germany as an over the country drug in 1957. It was used in the hopes that it would prevent morning sickness in pregnant women, which it did. Unfortunately, however, it had the side effect of deforming the limbs of unborn children whose Mothers had taken the drug. Of the 10,000 children born with limbs that were malformed because of the drug, only 5,000 survived. Thalidomide was a case of drug companies destroying the lives of 10,000 people without malicious intent. It was also, as my opponent will doubtlessly point out, over 50 years ago. Whilst this is true, there are much more recent, yet less infamous, issues with the advances of medicine which have undoubtedly made lives worse. One example of this is in a BBC news report from 2006:[1] apos;Six men remain in intensive care after being taken ill during a clinical drugs trial in north-west London. The healthy volunteers were testing an anti-inflammatory drug at a research unit based at Northwick Park Hospital when they suffered a reaction. Relatives are with the patients, who suffered multiple organ failure. Two men are said to be critically ill.apos;This shows that the advancement of medicine has not necessarily made lives better, in fact, it could be said that, although more people now survive diseases, their quality of life is lower. An example of this would be the euthanasia debate.In the past, your doctor would help you survive disease until the point where you were in insufferable pain which could not be alleviated. At this point, your doctor could, and often would, make the decision to ease your passing with an overdose of drugs (normally morphine) with your consent. [2] apos;Throughout classical antiquity, there was widespread support for voluntary death as opposed to prolonged agony, and physicians complied by often giving their patients the poisons they requested.apos;This was made illegal in the UK in 1961, meaning that those suffering from a painful, debilitating and terminal disease may not make the decision to end their life with help if theyapos;re unable to do it alone. This is not just in the UK, euthanasia is illegal in almost every country in the world.[3] apos;As of 2014, euthanasia is only legal in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg.apos;Despite even this, the increase in world population is not inherently a good thing in itself. It has led to oppressive but necessary policies such as the Chinese one child policy, which has seen the murder of many young girls in the hopes that the parents will have a son. Thus, my argument is that whilst life expectancy has gotten longer, quality of life has not.2. Better technology for everybodyMy opponent again correctly suggests that technology has not only improved over the years, but has also become more available to the average peasant (citizen). However, this is not necessarily a good thing.My opponent asserts: apos;Not to mention we have much cheaper methods than trains--with our new subways all around--and better airplanes--from Wrightapos;s first to now, fighter jets and humongous airliners-- transportation is cheaper, easier, and faster than ever. With better transportation, countries can trade more easier, and people can get from place to place easier as well. The world is definitely changing for the better with these technological innovations.apos;This is all very well and good, however, the increase in apos;better transportapos; has massively increased the consumption of oil and other natural resources all around the world. Here we see the increase in diesel consumption per year in just the USA. This data only goes up to the year 1998, however, I can tell you that the fuel consumption in the year 2013 in just the USA [4]apos;about 134.51 billion gallons1 (or 3.20 billion barrels) of gasoline.apos;This tremendous increase in the use of natural resources has resulted in a tremendous increase in greenhouse gases emmitted into the atmosphere, notably carbon dioxide.As you can see here, the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased substantially from 1960-2010. This is resulting in a apos;warmingapos; on a global scale. An effect that is commonly known as apos;global warming.apos;This has resulted in the extinction of countless species and will result in the extinction of countless more.[5]apos;Polar bears have started drowning as they have had to swim longer distances between ice flows, and the U.S. Geological Survey has predicted that if the Arctic ice cape continues melting at its current rate, “two-thirds of the worldapos;s polar bear sub-populations will be extinct by mid-century.”7 Of course, it is not just the polar bear that is affected—one study predicts that a quarter of land animals and plants could become extinct because of global warming over the next 45 years.8apos;[6]apos;Parmesan and most other scientists hadnapos;t expected to see species extinctions from global warming until 2020. But populations of frogs, butterflies, ocean corals, and polar birds have already gone extinct because of climate change, Parmesan said.apos;My opponent implies that communication has become easier in the past few hundred years with the invention of increasingly better, more convenient and inexpensive telephones, right up to the mobile phone. I would agree with him, but that does not mean that the quality of communication has gone up. In fact, I would argue that the quality of communication has definitely gone down.I want to transport my reader back to a time that is no longer in living memory. A time where telephones did not exist and the easiest form of long-range communication was a letter. I want to transport my reader back to the 1830apos;s, to a young girl called Victoria, who would later be known as Queen Victoria. She wished to write her sister, whom had gone to live with the Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, a letter. It had been many years since she had been allowed to see her sister, and after writing the letter she waited excitedly for a reply. Can you imagine her dismay when, a few days later, she opened an envelope addressed to her from her sister to see nothing but the letter apos;Kapos; written upon an almost blank piece of paper?This, of course, never happened. The cost of sending a letter, whilst not expensive, was costly enough to ensure detailed communication with ones friends and loved ones which invoked a feeling of closeness that is not as often seen in the communications of today. This is primarily because now, with the invention of social media and texting, it is so incredibly easy to lose the sense of connection that communication held in the time of letters. Lengthy and structured replies are no longer seen as important, formality is an art that is often no longer understood or seen to be necessary. The phenomenon of the apos;Kapos; response is often wrote about, it is well recognised for its rude abruptness, yet many people still continue to use it because, with the invention of easier communications, there is little practical reason not to. Thus, I argue that whilst the quantity of communication has increased, the quality of communication has gone down. As has, therefore, the quality of friendships and relationships.More arguments next round.

    <t>I thank my opponent for accepting. Seeing how he is unbeatable, Iapos;ll make my arguments extra tough!*WARNING*: Lots of pictures. Donapos;t blame me if I miss a picture that canapos;t be seen. I canapos;t make sure all of them remain pictures. :PLetapos;s start off with the basics.1. Less people dieAs modern medicine is improving, less people die by disease. The two graphs below [both fromhttp://blogs.berkeley.edu...] show that fewer and fewer children are dying.  Just in case my opponent somehow accuses my source being quot;biasedquot;, I shall provide another graph to back up my information:Japan? Japanapos;s just being weird. :P Besides, itapos;s such a small region, it doesnapos;t really effect the overall resolution anyways. We donapos;t really know whether Japan is changing for the better, but certainly the world is.Thus it is evident, we save lives of innocent children; the world is definitely changing for the better. Now onto argument number two...2. Better technology for everbodyAs the world progresses so does its transportation. Before we started off with the first car ever made...Now we have ultra-aerodynamic cars....s://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com...; alt=quot;quot; width=quot;708quot; height=quot;398quot; /gt;They move gazillions time faster than the first car ever, and are far more efficient. Not to mention we have much cheaper methods than trains--with our new subways all around--and better airplanes--from Wrightapos;s first to now, fighter jets and humongous airliners-- transportation is cheaper, easier, and faster than ever. With better transportation, countries can trade more easier, and people can get from place to place easier as well. The world is definitely changing for the better with these technological innovations.Not only so, communication has improved much. Long long ago, we had to use the telegraph. Then we moved on to the first telephone ever.Then we had home phones...Cellphones...And finally, the iPhone!!From hard communication, to easier communication, to the addition of internet searches, GPS, and games, our communication device has improved much, and it has become more and more helpful as we have improved. We see the world changing for the better with technologyapos;s vast improvements.  3. Poor people are being helped Not only less people are dying, and less people are getting sick, people are getting better medical benefits. quot;in 2002, only 230,000 people in the developing world were getting treatment with lifesaving but expensive antiretroviral medicines.quot; www.mistergui.com/downloads/The%20Case%20for%20Optimism.doc says. quot;Today, in part because the pharmaceutical industry moved from being a low-volume, high-margin business to a low-margin, high-volume one with guaranteed payments, that number is 8 million. quot; --http://content.time.com.... Not only so, quot; in the 25 years leading up to the current economic crisis, more people worldwide moved from poverty to the middle class than at any other time in history.quot; The next page of this article, http://content.time.com..., states. Now, why is this important, other than saving peopleapos;s lives as said in the first argument? Well, you see, thievery is mostly due to poor people not being able to make enough money for themselves or their family, and thus forced to steal from others. But since they are helped and no longer have to pay so much for medication, they can delve their efforts into other parts of financial responsibility and steal less, if they even continue to steal. This argument also has another (surprising) side effect. Itapos;s actually not technically a side effect. Itapos;s actually a side related policy that caused to help out people. You see, Brazil managed to efficiently cut its deforestation rates by 75%. [source: http://rainforests.mongabay.com...]How does this have to do with helping poor people? Well you canapos;t help people without sufficient economy right? So therefore Brazil cut down on its oil spending, creating new jobs to support the economy, and maximizing the hydropower. Brazil, in an effort to change its own economy, helps its people. This of course applies to most other countries as well. They want to help their government and society? They have to start with the people. Thus, governments in their attempt to grow in power and influence, inevitably improve peopleapos;s lives--and the environment for the animalsapos; lives-- for the better.  Now letapos;s go to....4. Human rightsHumans are gaining more and more rights as revolutions and rebellions occur. From the overall natural rights of life, liberty and pursuit of happiness [http://www.crf-usa.org...] to the voting rights of all men, including blacks, then to the civil war, where slavery was finally abolished, and recently, women gaining quot;equal treatment of women and men under the law and voting rights.quot; [http://www.infoplease.com...] Thus we see here, the rights progress, from everyone having practically completely different statuses--white men, black men, and women--transform into the men versus woman movement, and finally our people as one. Nowadays, pretty much the only right that women donapos;t have is topless rights. Weapos;re working on that, though. After some debate weapos;ll come to a good conclusion and do women justice. I have like 2,500 characters left but I canapos;t really think of anything I havenapos;t covered. Technology improved and helps everyone in their usual lives. Peopleapos;s living styles improved--with their environment around them improving too- and they are also gaining more rights as they continue to fight for themselves. The world is definitely changing for the better.Onto you, mighty unbeaten JayConar.</t>

    <t>Letapos;s see now... 1. Enthusiana debate Of course, enthusiana was the only treatment availible during olden days. Nowadays we have alternative options availible. With increasing methods to keep these people alive without their massive pain, we have better care and training. The easy way out would not allow us to help doctors increase their skills of caring for these terminally ill persons. Furthermore, people who choose enthusiana are usually depressed and only see the sad side, the burdened side of life. By not taking the easy way out, we can learn about their problems that might be effecting their decisions. Maybe one day the man lost his job and his spouse died by heart disease, and heapos;s so depressed he think heapos;s sick too, and the only way out is enthusiana. But thatapos;s not right. We can treat his depression, we can treat his illusion of sickness. If we instantly just terminate him without really finding out about his sickness, then itapos;s immoral. Also, we cannot learn how to treat the specific sickness, if the patient is really sick. What if 1,000 more people die of disease X, and we didnapos;t investigate the first person who obtained the disease, just killed him with enthusiana! We lose many chances at medical research that could save the lives of others. The doctor also earns far too much power in enthusiana, and his diagnosis could be wrong, as well as new research that could change the outcome. His emotion or tiredness could affect his decision; too much variables could contribute to an immoral death. There are many reasons why enthusiana isnapos;t legalized in all of those countries my opponent mentioned. Thereapos;s a reason my opponent sourced a majority of countries that prefer no enthusiana to legalizing enthusiana. 2. Better technology So what that we consume fuel? We seek other sources; renewable sources that are more efficient and are more environmental, gaining more energy in the process! Carbon dioxide increase: *Laughs* I was expecting this argument. Now, look at his graph. Tell me whatapos;s wrong with it. Nothing? Okay, look on the right side....thatapos;s right... itapos;s merely from 310 to 390, and weapos;re merely counting the years 1960-2010. This is what the graph would look like if we started from zero:  Eh, eh? Doesnapos;t look so bad now eh? Seriously, that graph is biased. On the other hand, if we look at the bigger picture....   [source: http://www.freerepublic.com...] And this...  [source: http://earthintime.com...]  We see here, even if carbon dioxide is being released (not to mention, at very small rates), the global temperature is not effected by it. In fact, the temperature is still decreasing as shown over time. Since the earth has not warmed, my opponent cannot contribute it to the quot;extinction of countless speciesquot;. As for arctic melting, that makes no sense. The arctic is not melting at all, it is, in fact, expanding.  [source: http://www.dailymail.co.uk...] We see it is obvious, my opponent is wrong. Wherever he got the idea of global warming, we donapos;t know. But it isnapos;t happening. As for the letter, my opponent only shows how our world nowadays is much better in communication. You see, long ago people just wrote quot;Kquot;. I even heard of a famous story of a writer who wrote to her publishers, quot;?quot; concerning her novel, and the publishers responding, quot;!quot;. Seriously guys? Now, we donapos;t have to pay for these letters. We can instantly send them by email or by cell phone, much more quickly. The world is much more interconnected with email and computers; two friends separated by 3,000 miles no longer have to wait one month for each otherapos;s letters to arrive, they can instantly talk to each other with only waiting a few seconds--or milliseconds--to respond to each otherapos;s messages, and even see each other through face time! As you can see here, my opponentapos;s case defeats his own. Global temperature is actually cooling, not warming. Enthusiana is illegal for a good reason. He dropped almost all of my arguments, and I hope he comes back to rebut them later. Back to you, mighty unbeaten Jay!</t>

    <t>My friendapos;s argument relies on two things:1. Euthanasia is wrong in all circumstances.2. Global warming does not exist EuthanasiaMy opponent asserts that: apos;enthusiana was the only treatment availible during olden days.apos; This statement is incorrect. Although my opponent was vague due to not explaining what he means by apos;olden daysapos; Iapos;m going to assume he means classical antiquity.There were a number of medical textbooks in classical antiquity, as well as a number of famous physicianapos;s such as Paul of Aegina, whom wrote the apos;[1]Epitomes iatrikes biblio heptaapos;Surgery was also available as a treatment in antiquity.apos;If the wounded man or his companions attempted to extract an arrow by pulling on the shaft, there was a good chance that the arrowhead itself would be left within the wound. Celsus and Paul of Aegina offer step-by-step instructions that S. says would have been usefulapos;.Thus euthanasia was not the only treatment available in antiquity, and would also only have been used on somebody who was in a terminal condition and was, therefore, suffering unbearable amounts of pain which would only lead to death anyway. My opponent has not offered a rebuttal for why euthanasia should not be used in cases such as this when, often, modern painkillers wonapos;t even take the edge off of pain that occurs when somebody is dying as to do so would mean giving the patient an overdose of one or another drug, which would be euthanising them. The argument sort of loops around like that.Global WarmingMy opponent asserts that: apos;even if carbon dioxide is being released (not to mention, at very small rates), the global temperature is not effected by it.apos;My opponent has decided to argue that global warming does not exist. In doing this he decides to use this graph as evidence:We cannot be sure from exactly where my opponent found this graph, however, we can be sure that there is definitely a positive correlation as, with time, the PPM (Parts per million) of Carbon Dioxide steadily increases. This graph has been scaled all the way back to 1900 in order to make the positive correlation seem weaker, however the positive correlation is still extant. Therefore my opponent has worked to prove my point.My opponent asserts that the absorption of more Carbon Dioxide into the air does not effect the global temperature. To prove this he puts up a picture of the ice caps in September 2013 and September 2012.As we can see here, the global temperature does vary by about 0.2 of a degree quite frequently. However, the average global temperature has definitely increased exponentially since 1980 relative to 1880-1980. This suggests that there is a positive correlation between carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the global temperature. But a correlation does not necessarily suggest a causual relationship, so letapos;s have a look at the science.apos;[3]Most of the light energy from the sun is emitted in wavelengths shorter than 4,000 nanometers (.000004 meters).  The heat energy released from the earth, however, is released in wavelengths longer than 4,000 nanometers.  Carbon dioxide doesnapos;t absorb the energy from the sun, but it does absorb some of the heat energy released from the earth.  When a molecule of carbon dioxide absorbs heat energy, it goes into an excited unstable state.  It can become stable again by releasing the energy it absorbed.  Some of the released energy will go back to the earth and some will go out into space.apos;Thus global warming as a result of Carbon Dioxide is a very real thing which we should all be scared of and wouldnapos;t have happened if not for the technological advancement in transport which Pro attempts to paint in a positive light.

    <t>1. Euthanasia Again, what makes this pain real? Who says for sure the patients were really suffering? The brain can fool the rest of the body in many, many cases. For one, The Rubber Hand experiment demonstrates how the brain fools you into feeling your hand in the place of a rubber hand, while in reality your hand is further to the left. Not only so, you can control your body temperature by pure will, or even by meditation. [source: http://news.harvard.edu...] The brain can also confuse you into thinking that the below lines are awry, not straight, or at the very least not lined up, while in reality they are parallel.    [image source: http://www.allkidsnetwork.com...]    2. Global Warming  My opponent only sources the time period of 140 years, from 1880 to 2020 predictions. He does not look at the bigger picture, at the general decline from year 1000 to modern time, or even from millions of years ago to now, there has been the similar pattern regardless of CO2 emissions. And even if CO2 does create global warming, (which, really, itapos;s not even the main cause--global warming happens naturally due to climate changes, heavily due to changes in solar activity [source: http://www.breitbart.com...], itapos;s not bad to us at all. quot;CO2 levels are so low that more, not less, is needed to sustain and expand plant growth.quot;, quot;if CO2 levels are cut, he warns, food production will slow because plants grown at higher CO2 levels make larger fruit and vegetables and also use less water. quot;, and finally, quot;Earthapos;s atmosphere currently has about 338 parts per million of CO2 ....the danger level for carbon dioxide isnapos;t reached until the air has 8,000 parts per million of CO2.quot; All of these quotes, from http://www.usnews.com..., show that CO2 not only helps the environment (remember who you are, Brazil, when you remember cut down their rate of deforestation!) it does not harm us humans at all.   Opponent has failed to uphold his burden of proof. He does evoke philosophical stances within euthanasia, and he even goes for environmental effects. But he dropped a majority of my arguments in round 2, forgetting to refute them (and refuting them in the last round would be unfair, and he would have to have a conduct point lost), and overall, I have won. This was a good debate, but I believe I have become the first person to ever beat out JayConar. We are changing for the better; the world is changing for the better. Vote for me.</t>

    <t>Final RoundSimply stating that youapos;ve won does not mean that you have actually won, Iapos;m afraid.I have not dropped any of my opponents arguments, instead I have flipped them on their head, proving that the things that he paints in a positive light are, in fact, more negative than positive. Thus, I have rebutted my opponents points successfully and he had the BoP to prove that the world is actually changing for the better, he did not fulfill his BoP as I rebutted all his arguments. My opponent asserts that:apos;and refuting them in the last round would be unfair, and he would have to have a conduct point lost),apos;Yet he used the entirety of his last round refuting my rebuttals in which he essentially claims that pain does not exist as the brain is just tricking it (which is true, the brain is what makes you feel pain, but that does not stop an individual from suffering. If you stab yourself then it doesnapos;t matter how much you think apos;itapos;s just my brain sending signals,apos; it will still hurt), and claiming that global warming is due to solar activity and not carbon dioxide which, as we can seeItapos;s not. As for danger levels of CO2 not being reached until it reaches 8,000 PPM, allow me to read you the entire quote which my opponent harmfully cut to pieces:apos;[1]He also said that higher CO2 levels are not harmful to humans. As an example, he said that Earthapos;s atmosphere currently has about 338 parts per million of CO2 and that in Navy subs, the danger level for carbon dioxide isnapos;t reached until the air has 8,000 parts per million of CO2.apos; The CO2 levels may not be harmful to humans, but that is not the argument, the argument is that the variance in the temperature caused by the warming which is caused by the CO2 increase in the atmosphere is harmful, and has led to the extinction, of many species, which I proved in a previous round.It should be mentioned that source 1 was also published in 2009, 5 years ago, scientific views change very quickly so something which was posted 5 years ago is incredibly out of date.Most of my opponentapos;s last round is him, essentially, being irrelevant. Stating that pain is a mental process does not mean that people cannot be in insufferable pain and stating that you have won does not mean that you have won. My opponent has offered no argument that has got unrefuted by me, despite what he may think, and in this last round I have offered no new arguments, so conduct points should not be lost.Thank you for this debate.Sources:[1] http://www.skepticalscience.com...</t>

    <t>Contention 1: No Major/any CO2 Increase.      My opponent states that CO2 levels have never been this high, but that is incorrect. I give you the above graph measuring the past 600 million years of CO2 levels are we are actually at an all time low. Now the website I got this from no longer has this page up so I appologize. We can see from observance of this graph that we being at all time CO2 low levles that we are nowhere close to meeting the impact that my opponent brings up. We have been over 5,000 ppm of CO2 in our atmosphere and are now currently around apprx. 350 ppm CO2 levels.  The above graph shows that comparisions of C13 (Carbon isotope) and this shows that there is little to no trend pertrade in many of these as the average is zero while the trend for all of these are zero. (http://www.drroyspencer.com...) This is important as the Carbon isotope is important in measuring this so called quot;Global Warming.quot;  This chart above shows the CO2 and Earthapos;s temperatures for the past 600 million years. My opponentapos;s claims are incorect as we have had aburd levels of CO2 and temperature on Earth and may I ask how did we survive that? (http://www.sustainableoregon.com...)  Now I will move on to how Earth is actually cooling and how itapos;s temperature is cooler than it has been. Contention 2: Earth is cooling.  If we observe the above graph we can see that Earth has been a whole lot hotter than where we currently are to the point where the Earthapos;s average temperature has been 7.5 degrees Celcuis hotter than it currently it is. You can also see that in the span of the past 10,000 years the temperature has leveld off, but you may ask yourself where does that place us in the lights of modern day? You can also see that Proapos;s graph is actually in the 500 to 10 thousand years before present and we can see that fallowing those trends that the temperature has actually leveled off.   I am going to site Dr. Done Easterbrook, who is a climate scientist. Back in 2000 he predicted that Earth was entering a cooling phase. He predicts that for the next 20 years Earth will cool by 3/10 degree each year and that we are going to enter another little Ice Age like we did from 1650 and 1790. (http://www.cnsnews.com...) The funny thing is that many of my opponentapos;s charts are actually from the incorrect IPPC.  How about the quot;Hockey Stickquot; graph that many Global Warming supporters , including my opponent, argue about? Well if we observe the fallowing chart taken from Northern Scandenavia we can see that the Global trend over the past 1,000 years that the Global Cooling trend slope is that of -0.31 Degrees Celcuis, give or take 0.03 degrees (for the error room). Professor Dr. Jan Esper has found that the Earthapos;s temperature of Earth actually decreases 0.3 per millenia due to the Earth moving away from the sun. (http://newsbusters.org...)    Here is another graph from 1920 to 2005 and we can see that the graph has a negative temperature slope, thus meaning that the Earth is under a period of cooling. (http://blog.chron.com...) Contention 3: Artic Ice. First, I would like to state that Proapos;s claim about the North Pole completely melting is bogus.  Al Gore stated that the Artic Ice would be completely melted by 2014, but he is incorrect then and now.   Jan. 6, 2012: The Coast Guard Cutter Healy breaks ice around the Russian-flagged tanker Renda 250 miles south of Nome. The Healy is the Coast Guard’s only currently operating polar icebreaker. The vessels are transiting through ice up to five-feet thick in this area. The 370-foot tanker Renda will have to go through more than 300 miles of sea ice to get to Nome, a city of about 3,500 people on the western Alaska coastline that did not get its last pre-winter fuel delivery because of a massive storm. (http://www.thegatewaypundit.com...)  Letapos;s go back to 2007-2008 and see if his claim was justified in the Artic Ice activity.  Hmmm... It seems that he is incorrect, but letapos;s look further into the near past. How about 2012-2013? (http://ginacobb.typepad.com...)  We all remember the Climate Scientists that got stuck in Arctic Ice Earlier this year correct? Then a Russian Ice Breaker tried to free them, but got stuck. Can you guess what they were studying? They had predicted that all the Arctic Ice had melted due to Global Warming and that Earth would get flooded massively. Boy were they wrong. (http://www.nytimes.com...)   (http://www.americasfreedomfighters.com...)  How about Al Gore. The man who brought Global Warming to our attention? In 2009, the man breaks down in tears stating how itapos;s nothing, but hot air and how he fabricated everything just for the money! He said the arctic sheets are not melting and CO2 is not responsible for depletion of the Ozone. (http://www.thomaspeep.com...)  Dr. Koonin, former head of the Department of Energy under President Obama, has stated that the Global Warming scare is not suttle. This is because that he has found 3 things wrong and highly incorrect about the scare. 1. Shrinking of Artic Sea ice doesnapos;t acount for the gaining of the Antartic ice. 2. The warming of Earthapos;s temps today is the same as it was 30 years ago. 3. The sea levels rose at the same height and rate in the 20th cenury. (http://www.newsmax.com...) Contention 4: Sea Levels  Here is another corralation that must happen. If the Ice Caps are completely melted as Pro claims then the sea level would have risen completely drowning tons of land.  The graph above is raw satellite image data of the sea level rise over an 8 year period showing that there is little to no change in the Sea Levels rising. (http://joannenova.com.au...) The sea level rises, on average, about 3 inches per century and it has been found to not even been rising at all.  This graph is the sea levels off the cost of French Guyana which is one of the areas which is predicted to be flooded due to Global Warming, but as you can see by the graph (which goes to 2008) the sea level is currently on a downward trend. http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org...)

Here is a graph showing the thickness of polar caps melting exponentially http://en.wikipedia.org...  Here is a scientific article that refers to the ice caps being doomed http://www.scientificamerican.com...  =======================  Warming not caused by volcanoes and the Sun cycles  -------------- apos;The volcano theorists canapos;t even keep their stories straight. In his book, Limbaugh claims that the 1991 Pinatubo eruption put 1000 times as much chlorine into the atmosphere as industry has ever produced through CFCs; yet on Nightline, Pinatubo is alleged to have produced 570 times the equivalent of one yearapos;s worth of CFCs. Both canapos;t be right. It turns out neither are. The figure 570 apparently derives from Rayapos;s book--but she said it was Mount Augustine, an Alaskan volcano that erupted in 1976, that put out 570 times as much chlorine as one yearapos;s worth of CFCs. Rayapos;s source is a 1980 Science magazine article--but that piece was actually talking about the chlorine produced by a gigantic eruption that occurred 700,000 years ago in California (Science, 6/11/93).apos; apos;--------- Iapos;d also add, that the common sense answer to me is... consider all the smoke stacks out there. Consider all the pollution, places like LA. Iapos;d bet California itself is like a volcano very short period in intervals. doesnapos;t this make the most sense, considering how little and how infrequent volcanoes erupt? ----------  Scientific article saying the sun is only accounting for a third of our warming ------------- QUOTE With respect to global warming, though solar activity has been at relatively high levels during the recent period, the fact that solar activity has been near constant during the last 30 years precludes solar variability from playing a large role in recent warming. It is estimated that the residual effects of the prolonged high solar activity account for between 18 and 36% of warming from 1950 to 1999  ^ Stott, Peter A.; Gareth S. Jones and John F. B. Mitchell (15 December 2003). quot;Do Models Underestimate the Solar Contribution to Recent Climate Changequot;. Journal of Climate 16: 4079-4093. Retrieved on October 5, 2005. ----------------------  Here is a list of organizations that accept anthropogenic global warming as real and scientifically well-supported, and give discussions of the topic at the link: ----------------- * NASAapos;s Goddard Institute of Space Studies (GISS): * National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA): * Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): * National Academy of Sciences (NAS): * State of the Canadian Cryosphere (SOCC) - * Environmental Protection Agency (EPA): * The Royal Society of the UK (RS) - * American Geophysical Union (AGU): * American Meteorological Society (AMS): * American Institute of Physics (AIP): * National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR): * American Meteorological Society (AMS): * Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society (CMOS):  -------------------------  So: -We rule out major causes like the sun and earthapos;s rotation -Our north pole just melted completely a few years ago. this is a historic event that doesnapos;t occur very often at all. -If we look at ice levels in polar regions... we can see carbon and darker ice during the industrial revolution... and itapos;s noticeably lighter at the point the clean air act was introduced... this is simply evidence, but tangible evidence that this stuff is in not only the sky but everywhere. -If we look at temperature increases... yes, it shows we are getting hotter. We are setting records at a more frequent basis. -If we look at natural temperature increases... we see weapos;ve been increasing for thousands of years. But, we see that itapos;s been accelerating in recent history, particularly the industrial revolution where pollution occurs. This is in reference to the infamous quot;hockey stickquot; graph. No, we canapos;t deduce from that alone that weapos;re the cause, but we can give it as supporting the fact that thereapos;s an accelerated increase, especially at our time. -Studies have been done that show CO2 being a cause of warming. we might squabble about how much warming, but we know it causes some.</t>
